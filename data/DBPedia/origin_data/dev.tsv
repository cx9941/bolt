Charles Stewart, PC (August 26, 1868 – December 6, 1946) was a Canadian politician who served as the third Premier of Alberta from 1917 until 1921. Born in Strabane, Ontario, in Wentworth County, Stewart was a farmer who moved west to Alberta after his farm was destroyed by a storm. There he became active in politics and was elected to the Legislative Assembly of Alberta in the 1909 election. He served as Minister of Public Works and Minister of Municipal Affairs—the first person to hold the latter position in Alberta—in the government of Arthur Sifton. When Sifton left provincial politics in 1917 to join the federal cabinet, Stewart was named his replacement. As premier, Stewart tried to hold together his Liberal Party, which was divided by the Conscription Crisis of 1917. He endeavoured to enforce prohibition of alcoholic beverages, which had been enshrined in law by a referendum during Sifton's premiership, but found that the law was not widely enough supported to be effectively policed. His government took over several of the province's financially troubled railroads, and guaranteed bonds sold to fund irrigation projects. Several of these policies were the result of lobbying by the United Farmers of Alberta (UFA), with which Stewart enjoyed good relations; even so, the UFA was politicized during Stewart's premiership and ran candidates in the 1921 election. Unable to match the UFA's appeal to rural voters, Stewart's government was defeated at the polls and he was succeeded as premier by Herbert Greenfield. After leaving provincial politics, Stewart was invited to join the federal cabinet of William Lyon Mackenzie King, in which he served as Minister of the Interior and Mines. In this capacity he signed, on behalf of the federal government, an agreement that transferred control of Alberta's natural resources from Ottawa to the provincial government—a concession he had been criticized for being unable to negotiate as Premier. He served in King's cabinet until 1930, when the King government was defeated, but remained a member of Parliament until he lost his seat in 1935. He died in December 1946 in Ottawa.	President
Emmelia of Caesarea (Cappadocia, Central Anatolia, Turkey) (died May 30, 375) was born in the fourth century, a period in time whenChristianity was becoming more widespread, posing a challenge to the Roman government and its Pagan rule.She was the wife of Basil the Elder and bore nine or ten children, including Basil of Caesarea (born circa 330), Macrina the Younger, Peter of Sebaste, Gregory of Nyssa, and Naucratius. Emmelia—also known as Emilia or Emily—is venerated as a saint in both the Eastern Orthodox Church and the Roman Catholic Church and is said to have died on May 30, 375. However, she is not the only woman in her family to be venerated as a saint. Both her mother-in-law, Macrina the Elder, as well as her daughters, Macrina the Younger and Theosebia are recognized as saints in the Eastern Orthodox Church. Emmelia spent much of her later years living with her eldest daughter, Macrina the Younger. Macrina the Younger had a profound impact on her mother. With her husband no longer around, Emmelia and her daughter lived a life dedicated to Christianity, surrounded by servants whom they treated as equals, at Macrina the Younger's insistence. Their ascetic way of life attracted a following of women which created a convent-like atmosphere, where one was considered rich if she lived a pure and devout Christian life and disregarded the materialistic lure of earthly pleasures and possessions.

"The Anthrax mite (Sarcoptes anthracis) is a pathogenic mite and an intermediate host of anthrax. Sarcoptes anthracis was classified by Dmitri Ivanovsky in 1901 after first occurrences of infection on Asian Tufted Deers. The parasitic itch mite burrows into skin and causes sarcoptic mange, mostly seen on even-toed ungulates. Pregnant female mites tunnel into the stratum corneum of a host's skin and deposit eggs in the burrows. Young mites move about on the skin and molt into a \""nymphal\"" stage, hosting Bacillus anthracis in their digestive tract. They act as a vector that carries and transmits anthrax to their hosts causing an infection, which often results in death because the immune system was weakened by scabies before. The high host specificity of the mites is held responsible for the fact that mostly even-toed ungulates struggled with these consequences. In late 1950s the last foci of infection were reported in semi-domesticated reindeers after which no greater incidences were observed."	Arachnid

Alexander of Lincoln (died February 1148) was a medieval English Bishop of Lincoln, a member of an important administrative and ecclesiastical family. He was the nephew of Roger of Salisbury, a Bishop of Salisbury and Chancellor of England under King Henry I, and he was also related to Nigel, Bishop of Ely. Educated at Laon, Alexander served in his uncle's diocese as an archdeacon in the early 1120s. Unlike his relatives, he held no office in the government before his appointment as Bishop of Lincoln in 1123. Alexander became a frequent visitor to King Henry's court after his elevation to the episcopate, often witnessing royal documents, and he served as a royal justice in Lincolnshire. Although Alexander was known for his ostentatious and luxurious lifestyle, he founded a number of religious houses in his diocese and was an active builder and literary patron. He also attended church councils and reorganized his diocese by increasing the number of archdeaconries and setting up prebends to support his cathedral clergy. Under Henry's successor, King Stephen, Alexander was caught up in the fall from favour of his family, and was imprisoned together with his uncle Roger in 1139. He subsequently briefly supported Stephen's rival, Matilda, but by the late 1140s Alexander was once again working with Stephen. He spent much of the late 1140s at the papal court in Rome, but died in England in early 1148. During his episcopate he began the rebuilding of his cathedral, which had been destroyed by fire. Alexander was the patron of medieval chroniclers Henry of Huntingdon and Geoffrey of Monmouth, and also served as an ecclesiastical patron of the medieval hermit Christina of Markyate and Gilbert of Sempringham, founder of the Gilbertines.

"Sky Scottish was a short lived satellite television channel operating on the analogue Sky TV service for 18 months (between 1 November 1996 and 31 May 1998). The service, a joint venture between BSkyB and ITV franchise Scottish Television owners SMG plc (now STV Group plc), was aimed at Scots living outside Scotland, who would not otherwise be able to receive Scottish programming such as that transmitted within Scotland by Scottish Television, Grampian Television or BBC Scotland. It broadcast between 6.00 pm and 8.00 pm. The station's main programmes included an extra edition of Scottish Television's regional news programme Scotland Today and episodes of Take the High Road from 1994. Celtic F.C.'s 1997 pre-season friendlies were shown on the channel. Scotsport was also shown on the channel as well as spin-off show Extra Time. There was also The Football Show presented by Jim Delahunt and Peter McGuire. Despite BSkyB and SMG entering into a seven-year contract to run the service, Sky Scottish was closed down after just 18 months. Its closure was explained as the channel having failed to meet its financial targets. Reports suggested that only The Ibrox Club Hour and The Celtic Park Hour, programmes relating to Rangers and Celtic football clubs, had attracted more than 10,000 viewers. Speaking about its demise, the managing director of SMG at the time, Donald Emslie, described the service as having \""been a valuable learning experience\"" for his company. SMG's finance director, Gary Hughes, stated that the service had shown \""it is very difficult to access a Scottish audience outside Scotland\"", but also that Scottish audiences wanted more home-grown programmes."

The North Luzon Expressway (NLE or NLEx), formerly known as the North Diversion Road and Manila North Expressway (MNEX), is a 2 to 8-lane limited-access toll expressway that connects Metro Manila to the provinces of the Central Luzon region in the Philippines. It is a component of Radial Road 8 (R-8) of Metro Manila's road network. Its southern section from Guiguinto to Metro Manila is also designated as Expressway 1 (E1) of the Pan-Philippine Highway (AH26). It was built in the 1960s. The expressway begins in Quezon City at the Balintawak Interchange with EDSA: a continuation of Andres Bonifacio Avenue. It then passes through Quezon City, Caloocan, and Valenzuela in Metro Manila. Meycauayan, Marilao, Bocaue, Balagtas, Guiguinto, Malolos, Plaridel, and Pulilan, Calumpit in Bulacan. Apalit, San Simon, San Fernando, Mexico and Angeles in Pampanga. The expressway currently ends at Mabalacat and merges with the MacArthur Highway, which continues northward into the rest of Central and Northern Luzon. The segment between Santa Rita Exit and Balintawak Cloverleaf is a part of the new alignment of the Pan-Philippine Highway (AH26) There is a proposed direct interchange between the North Luzon Expressway and the Subic-Clark-Tarlac Expressway. The interchange is located 3 km. north of Sta. Ines Exit. Currently, the Spur/NLE exit served as the connection between the expressway and the Subic–Clark–Tarlac Expressway via Clark Spur Road. The expressway, including Andres Bonifacio Avenue, has total length of 88 kilometers. The expressway segment has a length of 84 kilometres. Originally controlled by the Philippine National Construction Corporation or PNCC, operation and maintenance of the NLEx was transferred in 2005 to the Manila North Tollways Corporation, a subsidiary of Metro Pacific Investments Corporation (formerly, it was the subsidiary of the Lopez Group of Companies until 2008). A major upgrade and rehabilitation has been completed in February 2005 and the road has now similar qualities as a modern French tollway. The main contractor of the rehabilitation work was Leighton Contractors Pty. Ltd (Australia) with Egis Projects, a company belonging to the French Groupe Egis as the main subcontractor for the toll, telecommunication and traffic management systems. To help maintain the safety and quality of the expressway, various rules are in effect, such as restricting the left lane to passing vehicles only and banning overloaded trucks.	Road

The Valparaíso Metro carried 19.31 million passengers in 2015. Together with the much bigger Santiago Metro, it is one of the only two subway systems in Chile (the Valparaíso Metro has a 5-kilometre (3.1 mi) underground stretch from Miramar through Chorrillos stations in Viña del Mar), \""but cannot be classified as a full metro due to the existence of various level crossings and the long distances between stations on the eastern section of the line\"" according to Robert Schwandl of UrbanRail.net. As a result of the presence of at-grade level crossings, the Valparaíso Metro is most analogous to a light rail system."	PublicTransitSystem

The Party! Party! Party! Party was a short-lived joke political party in ACT (Australia). Its candidates — Amanda Call and Shane McMillan — ran only in the 1989 Australian Capital Territory Legislative Assembly election, receiving a total 979 votes (0.69% of the vote). It was created as a joke since the creators did not believe in self-government when it became legal in ACT. As a result of the lax party registration laws that allowed this party and other similar parties (for example the Sun Ripened Warm Tomato Party and the Surprise Party) to stand candidates, the electoral legislation in the Australian Capital Territory was changed in 1991 to provide that parties must have 100 members and a constitution before they could register. This stopped people from registering joke parties just for the fun of it.	PoliticalParty

Potrerillos Dam is located on the Mendoza River, in Argentina's Potrerillos Valley. The dam was built between 1999 and 2003 by a consortium consisting of Industrias Metallurgicas Pescarmona (IMPSA) and Cartellone to provide flood control, hydroelectricity and irrigation water. The dam cost US$ 312 million to construct. Located about 30 kilometres (19 mi) southwest of Mendoza, the concrete-faced rockfill dam is 116 metres (381 ft) high and 395 metres (1,296 ft) long, impounding the 12 km (7.5 mi) long Potrerillos Reservoir. The dam and reservoir have lost significant storage capacity due to the high silt content of the Mendoza River. When the reservoir was first filled in 2003, the capacity was estimated at 627,000 cubic decametres (508,000 acre·ft), with a total surface area of 1,500 hectares (3,700 acres). This has since decreased to 420,000 dam3 (340,000 acre·ft) with a surface area of 1,300 ha (3,200 acres). The reduction in capacity has threatened the flood control capability of the dam, with the concern that the emergency spillway may become inadequate to pass high flood flows as the reservoir loses its capability to retain them.

Barry 'Hooker' Harrison (21 December 1935 – 20 September 2004) was an Australian rules footballer who played for Collingwood and North Melbourne in the Victorian Football League (VFL). Harrison, a ruckman, was known for his aggressive style of play. He spent the 1954 and 1955 seasons with the reserves and then joined the Navy as part of his National service which delayed his senior debut until 1958. His tagging job on Ron Barassi helped Collingwood win the 1958 Grand Final, as he not only kept the ball away from the Melbourne midfielder but also roughed him up, as demonstrated by his report for charging. He was delisted at the end of the 1961 season and after an unsuccessful return to the league with North Melbourne, Harrison became captain-coach of Sandringham.

"OGLE-TR-113b is an extrasolar planet orbiting the star OGLE-TR-113. In 2002 the Optical Gravitational Lensing Experiment (OGLE) detected periodic dimming in the star's light curve indicating a transiting, planetary-sized object. Since low-mass red dwarfs and brown dwarfs may mimic a planet, radial velocity measurements were necessary to calculate the mass of the body. In 2004, the object was proved to be a new transiting extrasolar planet. The planet has a mass 1.32 times that of Jupiter. Since the planet's inclination is known, the value is exact. It orbits the star (OGLE-TR-113) in an extremely close orbit, even closer than the famous planets 51 Pegasi b and HD 209458 b. The planet races around the star every 1.43 days. The radius of the planet is only 9% larger than Jupiter's, despite the heating effect by the star. Planets of its kind are sometimes called \""super-hot Jupiters\""."	Planet

1525 Savonlinna, provisional designation 1939 SC, is an eccentric, stony asteroid from the middle region of the asteroid belt, about 12 kilometers in diameter. It was discovered on 18 September 1939, by Finnish astronomer Yrjö Väisälä at the Turku Observatory in southwestern Finland. The asteroid orbits the Sun at a distance of 2.0–3.4 AU once every 4 years and 5 months (1,616 days). Its orbit is tilted by 6 degrees to the plane of the ecliptic and shows a relatively high eccentricity of 0.27. It has a divergent rotation period of 14.6 and 22.8 hours, based on two different observations made in 2012 and 2015, respectively. According to a preliminary analysis of WISE/NEOWISE cryogenic and post-cryogenic observations, the body has an albedo of 0.05, while the Infrared Astronomical Satellite, IRAS, observed an albedo of 0.13, and the Collaborative Asteroid Lightcurve Link derives a value of 0.08, which is unusually low for an assumed S-type asteroid. The minor planet was named for the eastern Finnish town Savonlinna, located in the heart of the Saimaa lake region.	Planet

"The Socorro wren (Troglodytes sissonii) is a species of bird in the Troglodytidae family.It is endemic to Socorro Island, Mexico. It was formerly placed in Thryomanes but was moved to Troglodytes considering \""manners, song, plumage, etc.\"" and by biogeography and mtDNA NADH dehydrogenase subunit 2 sequence analysis. Its natural habitats is the tropical arid Croton masonii–prickly pear shrubland and occasionally the more humid forest. It appears to prefer this habitat, limiting its presence above 600 m (2000 ft) although it does range over the whole island. During visits in 1953, the birds were observed to be out of breeding season in mid-March; territorial males were observed in mid-late November. The main limiting factors are by habitat destruction due to feral sheep and predation by feral cats. In 1953, it was noted to be unwary. However, the IUCN does not yet consider it threatened, because especially compared to the larger birds of Socorro, it has fared not too badly and remains among the most common local landbirds."	Bird

The Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Marseille, is a metropolitan archdiocese of the Latin Rite of the Roman Catholic church in France. The Archepiscopal see is in the city of Marseille, and the diocese comprises the arrondissement of Marseille, a subdivision of the department of Bouches-du-Rhône in the Region of Provence-Alpes-Côte d'Azur. According to local myth, the Church of Marseille was erected in the 1st century, by St. Lazarus, the young man mentioned in the Gospels who had been raised from the dead by Jesus Christ himself. His family migrated to Provence at some point after the Resurrection. The diocese of Marseille was abolished during the French Revolution, under the Civil Constitution of the Clergy (1790). Its territory was subsumed into the new diocese, called the 'Bouches-du-Rhone', which was part of the Metropolitanate called the 'Metropole des Côtes de la Méditerranée (which included ten new 'departements'). The electors of 'Bouches-du-Rhone' met at Aix beginning on 19 February 1791, and on 23 February elected Abbé Charles Benoît Roux, curé of Eyragues near Arles. He was consecrated in Paris by Constitutional Bishops Gobel, Miroudot and Gouttes. He very much enjoyed the social life of Marseille, but after the execution of Louis XVI on 21 January 1793, Roux joined the counter-revolutionaries. When Marseille was occupied by troops of the Convention, he fled to Aix. He was arrested and imprisoned on 20 September; he was taken to Marseille, where he faced a tribunal of the Revolution which condemned him to death. He was executed on 5 April 1794. The diocese was raised to the level of an Archdiocese on 31 January 1948 by Pope Pius XII. The suffragans of the archdiocese are: the Archdiocese of Aix, the Diocese of Ajaccio, the Archdiocese of Avignon, the Diocese of Digne, the Diocese of Fréjus-Toulon, the Diocese of Gap, and the Diocese of Nice.

The Florence Bridge is a bridge that carries Illinois Route 100 and Illinois Route 106 across the Illinois River just east of Florence, Illinois, hence the name. The bridge is the middle of the three crossings on IL 100, with the other two in Hardin (South of Florence) and Beardstown (North of Florence). From its opening in 1929 until 1991, it carried US Route 36 and IL 100. In 1991, Interstate 72 and the Valley City Eagle Bridges were completed six miles upstream, and US 36 was signed onto I-72, with the old route signed as IL 106 (IL 100 was not rerouted). The bridge was rehabilitated in 1981, and again in 2004. The second time, the bridge was closed due to the need to replace the deck. Traffic was detoured to I-72. In 2012, the bridge's lifting mechanism that allows barge traffic to pass under the bridge had serious problems, and continued use could affect the structural integrity of the span. Therefore, the span was raised and the bridge closed for 9 months for repairs, using I-72 as a detour. The bridge reopened on April 22, 2013.	Bridge

The Jamaraat Bridge (Arabic: جسر الجمرات‎‎; transliterated: Jisr Al-Jamaraat) is a pedestrian bridge in Mina, Saudi Arabia, near Mecca used by Muslims during the Stoning of the Devil ritual of the Hajj. The purpose of the bridge is to enable pilgrims to throw stones at the three jamrah pillars either from the ground level or from the bridge. Jamaraat is the plural of jamraah, the Arabic term for each of the pillars involved in the stoning ritual. It literally means a small piece of stone or a pebble. The bridge was originally constructed in 1963, and has been expanded several times since then. The pillars extend up through three openings in the bridge. Until 2006, the bridge had a single tier (i.e. a ground level with one bridge level above). At certain times, more than a million people may gather in the area of the bridge, which has sometimes led to fatal accidents.	Bridge

Kerala Varma Pazhassi Raja (also known as Cotiote Rajah or Pychy Rajah) (3 January 1753 – 30 November 1805) was one of the earliest freedom fighters in India. He was a warrior prince and de facto head of the kingdom of Kottayam or Cotiote in Malabar, India between 1774 and 1805. His struggles with English East India Company is known as the Cotiote War. He is popularly known as Kerala Simham (Lion of Kerala) on account of his martial exploits. Pazhassi Raja was a member of the western branch of the Kottayam royal clan. When Hyder Ali of the Kingdom of Mysore occupied Malabar in 1773 the Raja of Kottayam found political asylum in Tiruvitamkoor. Pazhassi Raja, the fourth prince in line for succession to the throne during this period, became one of the de facto heads of state surpassing several of his elder royals. He fought a war of resistance on Mysorean army from 1774 to 1793. On account of his refusal to flee and resolve to fight invaders, people of Kottayam stood firmly behind the Raja who had not abandoned them in their hour of misfortune. In 1792, after the Third Anglo-Mysore War, English imposed their paramountcy in Kottayam in violation to their earlier agreement of 1790 which recognised independence of Kottayam.Vira Varma, to whom Raja was a nephew, was appointed by the East India Company authorities as the Raja of Kottayam. To meet revenue target fixed by Company authorities, Vira Varma ordered exorbitant rate of tax to be collected from the peasantry and this move was met by a mass resistance led by Pazhassi Raja in 1793 who was opposed to surrender to English right from beginning. In 1796, the Company made an attempt to arrest Pazhassi Raja, but he evaded capture and instead fought back using guerrilla warfare. After a string of serious setbacks, the Company sued for peace in 1797. The conflict was renewed in 1800 over a dispute on Wayanad and after an insurgent warfare lasted for five years, Pazhassi Raja was killed on 30 November 1805 in a gun-fight at Mavila Todu near Kerala-Karnataka border.

The Igor I. Sikorsky Memorial Bridge (also known as the Sikorsky Memorial Bridge, and the Housatonic River Bridge) carries the limited-access Connecticut Route 15 over the Housatonic River, between Stratford and Milford, Connecticut. The first bridge, known as the Sikorsky Bridge (not to be confused with the new Igor I. Sikorsky Memorial Bridge's name), on the site, was completed in 1940, marking the completion of the Merritt Parkway and the starting point for construction of the adjoining Wilbur Cross Parkway, September 2, 1940. It featured two narrow lanes in each direction and open steel grid deck that saved moneybut was unpopular with drivers. A toll plaza stood at the eastern end of the Sikorsky Bridge until Connecticut abolished tolls in 1988. The toll booth is now preserved in Stratford at the Boothe Memorial Park and Museum. The Sikorsky Bridge is named after aviation pioneer Igor Sikorsky, whose helicopter factory is located along the riverfront immediately north of the bridge. After years of environmental studies, the Connecticut Department of Transportation awarded an $87 million contract to Balfour Beatty Construction to build the replacement bridge, the Igor I. Sikorsky Memorial Bridge, in 2000. The southern half of the Igor I. Sikorsky Memorial Bridge opened in 2003; the Sikorsky Bridge was demolished in 2004. In February 2004, the load unexpectedly shifted on a crane that was removing structural steel from the old bridge. The crane overturned and fell into the partially frozen Housatonic River, killing its operator. The remaining half of the Igor I. Sikorsky Memorial Bridge was completed in 2006, two years behind schedule. The new bridge has a concrete deck, with blacktop, three lanes in each direction, full left and right shoulders, a sidewalk for pedestrians, wrought-iron railing, and aesthetic lighting. The bridge also includes a system of concrete fenders that protects the bridge piers from ship collisions, a feature that was absent from the 1940 span. In 2006, the new bridge was formally dedicated as the Igor I. Sikorsky Memorial Bridge.	Bridge

On September 29, 1949, in a game against the Brooklyn Dodgers at Braves Field, Kuczek made his first and only appearance in the Major Leagues. In the second game of a doubleheader, rain had soaked the field and darkness was beginning to set in. In the bottom of the fifth inning with the Dodgers leading 8–0, Tommy Holmes stepped into the batter's box, and Connie Ryan entered the on deck circle wearing a raincoat. Unamused by Ryan's protest of the game continuing under such conditions (and the bonfire started on the dugout steps by other members of the Braves), umpire George Barr promptly ejected Ryan. Kuczek was selected to pinch-hit for Ryan, and was likely going to assume Ryan's position at shortstop were the game to continue. Holmes doubled off Dodger pitcher Don Newcombe, and Kuczek followed by doubling down the right field line. Newcombe then went on to strike out the next three Braves, and umpire Barr called the now official game in favor of the Dodgers. Kuczek never appeared in another MLB game, and retired after the completion of the 1950 minor league season. He worked with General Electric after his baseball career ended. He died in Scotia, New York, at the age of 85.	BaseballPlayer

Reviewers have found a range of themes in the series. Critical reaction to The Cain Saga was mixed: some felt that the mysteries were well-done with detailed art, while others found the art crude and the short stories confusing and predictable. Reviewers praised Godchild as an overdone, entertaining series with detailed and distinct art."	Manga

"Sunday Silence (March 25, 1986 – August 19, 2002) was an American-bred Thoroughbred racehorse and Sire. In 1989, he won the Kentucky Derby and the Preakness Stakes but failed to complete the Triple Crown when he was defeated in the Belmont Stakes. Later in the same year, he won the Breeders' Cup Classic and was voted American Champion Three-Year-Old Colt and American Horse of the Year. Sunday Silence's racing career was marked by his rivalry with Easy Goer, whom he held a three to one edge over. Easy Goer, the 1988 American Champion Two-Year-Old Colt defeated him by eight lengths in the Belmont and finished second to him in the Kentucky Derby by two and a half lengths, Preakness by a nose and Breeders' Cup Classic by a neck. Both horses were later voted into the American Hall of Fame. After his retirement from racing, Sunday Silence attracted little support by breeders in the United States and was exported to Japan. He was Leading Sire in Japan on thirteen occasions, surpassing the previous record of ten titles by Northern Taste. Although the relatively insular nature of Japanese racing at the time meant that Sunday Silence's success was initially restricted to his home territory, his descendants have in recent years won major races in Australia, France, the United Kingdom, Hong Kong, the United States and Dubai. Blood Horse pedigree expert Anne Peters said, \""Had Sunday Silence retired in Kentucky, it's almost certain he would have tanked commercially and been exported in disgrace, but he found his perfect gene pool and thrived instead.\"" In the Blood-Horse magazine List of the Top 100 U.S. Racehorses of the 20th Century, Sunday Silence is ranked #31."

"Makhi (Greek: Μάχη, meaning \""Battle\"" or \""Struggle\"") is a Greek-language Cypriot daily newspaper with close affiliation to radical right-wing and nationalist ideas. It was founded in 1960 by journalist and former EOKA gunman Nikos Sampson, as the voice of his \""Progressive Front\"", a nationalist party. Historically it has expressed the Enosis view, urging for a complete union to motherland Greece and with a strong anti-colonialist, anti-marxist and anti-Turkish orientation. During the Grivas-Makarios controversy, which dominated the Cypriot politics in the early 1970s, the newspaper fully supported Georgios Grivas and EOKA-B against Archbishop Makarios III, who held the presidency and was seen by Greek military junta of 1967-1974 as a pro-communist. The events of 1974, which culminated in the Turkish invasion of Cyprus isolated Sampson's followers and the newspaper lost nearly all the political influence it had once gathered. In the late 1990s the paper has moderated its views, and supported Glafkos Clerides and the Democratic Rally party. It is now owned by Sotiris Sampson, son of Nikos Sampson, who is a member of the Cyprus parliament. Without abandoning its nationalist view, the paper nowadays reflects the views of Democratic Rally (DISY) dissidents who were opposed to the Annan Plan, against party consensus. It also staunchly opposes the entrance of Turkey to the European Union, and supports the full withdrawal of the Turkish armed forces from the occupied Cypriot territory, either through diplomacy or though military action."

The Battle of Abbeville took place from 27 May to 4 June 1940, near Abbeville during the Battle of France in the Second World War. On 20 May, the 2nd Panzer Division advanced 56 miles (90 km) to Abbeville on the English Channel, overran the 25th Infantry Brigade of the 50th (Northumbrian) Infantry Division and captured the town at 8:30 p.m. Only a few British survivors managed to retreat to the south bank of the Somme and at 2:00 a.m. on 21 May, the III Battalion, Rifle Regiment 2 reached the coast, west of Noyelles-sur-Mer. The 1st Armoured Division (Major-General Roger Evans) arrived in France from 15 May without artillery, short of an armoured regiment and the infantry of the 1st Support Group, which had been diverted to Calais. From 27 May – 4 June, the Franco-British forces south of the Abbeville bridgehead, held by the 2nd Panzer Division, then the 57th Infantry Division, recaptured about half of the area; the Allied forces lost many of their tanks and the Germans much of their infantry, some units running back over the River Somme. On 5 June, the divisions of the German 4th Army attacked out of the bridgeheads south of the Somme and the Franco-British divisions opposite, which had been much depleted by their counter-attacks, were pushed back to the Bresle with many casualties. In 1953, the British official historian, L. F. Ellis wrote that the Allies lacked battlefield co-ordination, which contributed to the Allied failure to defeat the Germans and magnified the cost of lack of preparation and underestimation of the German defences south of the Somme. In 2001, Caddick-Adams also wrote of the chronic lack of battlefield communication within and between the British and French divisions, was caused by a shortage of radios and led to elementary and costly tactical errors. The lack of communication continued after reinforcement by the 51st (Highland) Infantry Division (Major-General Victor Fortune) and French armoured and infantry divisions. The Germans had committed substantial forces to the bridgeheads, despite the operations in the north, that culminated in the Dunkirk evacuation from (26 May – 3 June). The Somme crossings at Abbeville and elsewhere were still available on 5 June, for Fall Rot (Case Red), the final German offensive, which brought about the defeat of France.	MilitaryConflict

The Fitzgerald Theater is the oldest active theatre in Saint Paul, Minnesota, and the home of American Public Media's A Prairie Home Companion. It was one of many theaters built by the Shubert Theatre Corporation, and was initially named the Sam S. Shubert Theater. It was designed by the noted Chicago architectural firm of Marshall and Fox, architects of several theaters for the Shuberts. In 1933, it became a movie outlet known as the World Theater. The space was purchased by Minnesota Public Radio in 1980 and restored with a stage in 1986 as a site for Prairie Home, and was renamed in 1994 after St. Paul native F. Scott Fitzgerald. The theater is owned by Minnesota Public Radio. On November 4, 2002, the theater was the site of a memorable election-eve debate between United States Senate candidates Norm Coleman (previously mayor of St. Paul) and Walter Mondale (formerly a U.S. Vice President) and moderated by Gary Eichten of MPR and Paul Magers of local television station KARE. Tension was heightened at the time because Mondale stepped in as a candidate at the last minute after the death of Paul Wellstone, who had been running for re-election. In 2005, the theater was used for filming the Prairie Home Companion movie directed by Robert Altman. While a certain level of realism is added by using the normal venue for the show, the regular equipment was eschewed in favor of sets designed for the movie. Because the theater is a small building, other theaters in the region were also scouted prior to filming, just in case the Fitzgerald was not big enough, but eventually it was determined to be adequate for the film's needs.

KBYU-FM is a classical music radio station run by Brigham Young University in Provo, Utah. Operating at 89.1 MHz, it is known on-air as Classical 89. It transmits at an effective radiated power of 32 kW. Its transmitting tower is located on a peak of the Oquirrh Mountains northwest of the university campus, and southwest of Salt Lake City. The station previously broadcast at a frequency of 88.9 MHz (during which time its nickname was Classical 88). The frequency was shifted in 1988 by directive of the FCC, to alleviate interference for nearby frequencies used for aerial navigation, and to allow for a new full-power station to be built on 99.5 in the Salt Lake market. Classical 89 also has the following translators: 89.5 FM K208BZ Spanish Fork, 106.9 FM K295BW Nephi, 96.1 FM K241BV Milford, 100.3 FM K262BM Cedar City, 100.7 FM K264BM Ivins. KBYU began as a carrier current station at 660 AM in 1946. It became available across Provo and the surrounding area in 1948 by using the city's power lines as an antenna. In 1959, BYU was granted a commercial FM license. The new station signed on for the first time on May 9, 1960 under the temporary calls KBRG. After negotiations to get the KBYU calls from a liberty ship, the call letters changed to KBYU on November 9, 1960. The station presently broadcasts around the clock, having gone to that schedule in 1986. Most of its on-air staff consists of professionals, although students do cover some weeknight and weekend on air shifts. Students also play a key role in behind-the-scenes functions. The station is operated as a non-profit corporation, and employs three to four fundraisers during the year to raise a portion of its operating revenue. Other funding sources include Brigham Young University, Corporation for Public Broadcasting, and local underwriting by businesses and arts organizations. In 2006, KBYU-FM began broadcasting an 'HD Radio' signal along with its main signal, and subsequently began carrying sports and talk programming from sister station 'BYU Radio' on its HD2 signal.

"Lord Henry \""Harry\"" Paulet KCB (1767 – 28 January 1832) was an officer in the Royal Navy who saw service in the American War of Independence, the French Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars. Born into the British nobility as a younger son of the Marquess of Winchester, he rose through the ranks and had gained his own command by the early stages of the French Revolutionary Wars. He was involved in a number of famous engagements during his career, such as the capture of the French frigate Gloire in 1795, though he narrowly missed out on seeing direct action at two of the most significant naval battles of the wars with the French. The first was the Battle of Cape St Vincent, where he had left Jervis's fleet a few days previously, the second was the Battle of Copenhagen, where he remained with Sir Hyde Parker's reserve squadron. He nevertheless rose through the ranks to reach vice-admiral, despite an incident that saw him court-martialled and dismissed, only to be reinstated by the intervention of the King; and a tendency to eccentricity. He married towards the end of the wars with France, and had several children. Paulet served as one of the Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty from 1813, and was installed as a Knight Commander of the Bath in 1815, but ill-health forced his retirement from active service shortly afterwards, and he eventually died of cancer in 1832."

Pictures from the Insects' Life (in Czech: Ze života hmyzu) – also known as The Insect Play, The Life of the Insects, The Insect Comedy, The World We Live In and From Insect Life – is a satirical play that was written in the Czech language by the brothers Karel Čapek and Josef Čapek, who collaborated on some 20 stage works, of which this is the most famous. It was published in 1921 and premiered in 1922. In the play, a tramp/narrator falls asleep in the woods and dreams of observing a range of insects that stand in for various human characteristics in terms of their lifestyle and morality: the flighty, vain butterfly, the obsequious, self-serving dung beetle, the ants, whose increasingly mechanized behaviour leads to a militaristic society. The anthropomorphized insects allow the writers to comment allegorically on life in post-World War I Czechoslovakia.	Play

2011 BT15 (also written 2011 BT15) is an Apollo near-Earth asteroid and potentially hazardous object. In 2013 it had the 5th highest impact threat on the Palermo Technical Impact Hazard Scale. It was discovered on 24 January 2011 by Pan-STARRS at an apparent magnitude of 22 using a 1.8-meter (71 in) Ritchey–Chrétien telescope. It has an estimated diameter of 150 meters (490 ft). It was removed from the Sentry Risk Table on 17 June 2013. Before the 2013 recovery it had an observation arc of 41 days with an uncertainty parameter of 7. Due to precovery images from 2007 it now has an observation arc of more than 5 years. It makes close approaches to Earth and Mars. While listed on the Sentry Risk Table, virtual clones of the asteroid that fit the uncertainty region in the known trajectory showed a 1 in 71,000 chance that the asteroid could impact Earth on 5 January 2080. With a 2080 Palermo Technical Scale of −3.58, the odds of impact by 2011 BT15 in 2080 were about 3800 times less than the background hazard level of Earth impacts which is defined as the average risk posed by objects of the same size or larger over the years until the date of the potential impact. JPL Horizons shows that the nominal pass will be on 17 January 2080 at a distance of 0.125 AU (18,700,000 km; 11,600,000 mi) from Earth. 2011 BT15 passed 0.03222 AU (4,820,000 km; 2,995,000 mi) from Earth on 28 December 2013. The December 2013 passage was studied by the Goldstone Deep Space Network and further refined the orbit.	Planet

"Blue Monday (Opera à la Afro-American) was the original name of a one-act \""jazz opera\"" by George Gershwin, renamed 135th Street during a later production. The English libretto was written by Buddy DeSylva. Though a short piece, with a running time of between twenty and thirty minutes, Blue Monday is often considered the blueprint to many of Gershwin's later works, and is often considered to be the \""first piece of symphonic jazz\"" in that it was the first significant attempt to fuse forms of classical music such as opera with American popular music, with the opera largely influenced by Jazz and the African-American culture of Harlem."

The 1992 United States presidential election in California took place on November 3, 1992 throughout all 50 states and D.C., which was part of the 1992 United States presidential election. Voters chose 54 representatives, or electors to the Electoral College, who voted for President and Vice President. This was the first time that California had voted for a Democratic presidential nominee since Lyndon B. Johnson in the 1964 election, and Clinton's win in this state changed its status from reliably Republican to decisively Democratic to the present, and the state maintains the largest number of electoral votes in the Electoral College. California voted for the Democratic challenger, Arkansas Governor Bill Clinton, over the Republican incumbent, George H. W. Bush, the first time the state voted Democratic since 1964. Ross Perot won only one county: Trinity County, California. California has voted increasingly Democratic despite Reagan's decisive wins in his home state during the 1980 and 1984 elections, Changing demographics made the state much closer and Michael Dukakis only narrowly fell short of winning California in 1988.

"Edgar Allen Diddle (March 12, 1895 – January 2, 1970) was an American college men's basketball coach. He is known for coaching at Western Kentucky University in Bowling Green, Kentucky from 1922 to 1964. Diddle became the first coach in history to coach 1,000 games at one school. Diddle was known for waving a red towel around along the sidelines during his games. He was known to wave, toss, and chew on this towel, and even cover his face in times of disappointment. His red towel is now part of WKU's official athletic logo. Diddle experienced only five losing seasons in 42 years and averaged 25 wins per year overall. He was born in Gradyville, Kentucky. Diddle's teams claimed 32 conference championships; played in 11 postseason tournaments; won 20+ games eighteen different times, (including one stretch of ten years in a row); became the first team from the South to participate in the Olympic Trials; and won an amazing 759 games. When he stepped down in 1964 Diddle had won more games than any coach in NCAA history and today he still ranks in the top ten on the all-time list. While Diddle was best known for coaching men's basketball, he also coached football (1922-1928) baseball (1923-1957) and women's basketball at WKU, although men's basketball was his only coaching job for the vast majority of his tenure at the school. Prior to coming to Western Kentucky, Diddle played basketball and football for Centre College and was a member of their 1919 undefeated basketball team and 1919 undefeated football team. He was a halfback on the football team. After college he coached basketball at Monticello High School, where he guided the team to the Kentucky State Tournament semi-finals, and then Greenville High School, which played in a regional tournament at Bowling Green. During the tournament, he came to the attention of officials at Western Kentucky who offered him the coaching position at the college. E. A. Diddle Arena, the basketball venue at WKU, built in 1963, is named for him. For the last six years of his life, Diddle was a fixture at the arena, even leading cheers. During a 1968 game against Dayton, he jumped on top of a press table to lead the students in cheers. When a Dayton sportswriter told him to get down, Diddle snapped, \""What do you mean I can't get on top of this table? This is my damn gym!\""."	CollegeCoach

Acontias is a genus of limbless skinks, the lance skinks, (family Scincidae) in the African subfamily Acontinae. Most are small animals, but the largest member of the genus is Acontias plumbeus at approximately 40 cm (16 in) snout-vent length. All members of this genus are live-bearing, sandswimmers, with fused eyelids. A recent review  moved species that were formerly placed in the genera Typhlosaurus, Acontophiops, and Microacontias into this genus, as together these form a single branch in the tree of life. This new concept of Acontias is a sister lineage to Typhlosaurus, and these two genera are the only genera within the subfamily Acontinae.	Reptile

The Château d'Étobon is a ruined castle in the commune of Étobon in the Haute-Saône département of France, 6 km from the town of Héricourt. The ruins stand on a hill dominating the village of Étobon. Its position and its considerable construction works contributed to its strength. It is 167 m above the village, and measures 220 m by 60 m. Burned and destroyed by the Duke of Furstemberg in 1519, it fell into ruin. Ulrich, Duke of Württemberg, recovered the castle but did not believe he could repair it. From the 17th century, after the Thirty Years' War, the villagers, with the permission of the Prince of Montbéliard, removed a large quantity of its stones for the construction of houses. Their descendants continued this destruction. Today, there remain only a few traces of this ancient castle.	Castle

"410 Tactical Fighter Operational Training Squadron (French: 410e Escadron d'entraînement opérationnel à l'appui tactique), nicknamed the \""Cougars\"", is a Royal Canadian Air Force aircraft squadron currently located at Canada's primary training base for the CF-18 (Canadian Forces version of the McDonnell Douglas F/A-18 Hornet), at Cold Lake, Alberta. The squadron was formed during the Second World War as an RCAF squadron under the Royal Air Force (RAF), at RAF Ayr, near Prestwick, in Scotland. The first official sortie of No. 410 Squadron was from RAF Drem, East Lothian, Scotland, on the night of 4 June 1942, when twelve Beaufighter crews took off, and it went on to become the top-scoring night fighter squadron in the RAF Second Tactical Air Force during the period between D-Day and VE-Day. No. 410 Squadron supported the Allied forces during the Normandy Landings and the Battle of the Bulge, flew nightly patrols during this time and many of its pilots gained ace status. Two members of No. 410 Squadron, Flight Lieutenant (F/L) Currie and Flying Officer (F/O) Rose, were the first members of the RCAF to see the German V-2 rocket in flight. The squadron was disbanded in 1964 but reformed again in 1968. As No. 410 Tactical Fighter Operational Training Squadron, the squadron usually trains between 20 and 22 pilots a year on the CF-18, more than any other RCAF squadron. The Canadian documentary television series Jetstream was filmed with the squadron in 2007 and showed what trainees must endure to become fighter pilots."	MilitaryUnit

"Gaspar Jorge de Leão Pereira, or simply Gaspar de Leão Pereira or Gaspar de Leão (Lagos - Goa, 15 August 1576) was the first Archbishop of Goa. He was appointed Archbishop of Goa, Primate of the East in 1558 or 1559. He arrived in Portuguese India on 15 April 1560 to take possession of his charge. After seven years, in 1567, he renounced the position, and retired to the Franciscan convent, a few miles from Goa. He was succeeded by Jorge Temudo. On the latter's death in 1571, Gaspar returned to occupy the archdiocese, where he remained until his own death in 1576. José António Ismael Gracias points to several names of archbishops who marked the history of the printing press, including Gaspar de Leão Pereira, who is cited by the author as the \""male doctor and virtuoso, presiding over the destinies of the archdiocese, also chaired the movement of these presses.\"" However, this same author notes the existence of prior censorship of books that were printed: \""We have seen that most of the books that we have made mention, were printed prior to censorship and licenses, including those of Archbishop Gaspar! ... What do these criticisms show up and licenses for books written by people of recognized letters and piety? If anything proves the power of the terrible Inquisition, the power that knew no bounds, and that extended up to shackle the mind and oppose the free expression of thought.\"" (Gracias, p. 23). He was also founder of the St. Paul's College in Goa, where printers were free and uncensored, in order to follow the intellectual movement.

"\""Renascence\"" (also \""Renasance\"") is a 1912 poem by Edna St. Vincent Millay, credited with introducing her to the wider world, and often considered one of her finest poems. The poem is a 200+ line lyric poem, written in the first person, broadly encompassing the relationship of an individual to humanity and nature. The narrator is contemplating a vista from a mountaintop. Overwhelmed by nature, and thoughts of human suffering, the narrator empathetically feels the deaths of others, and feels pressed into a grave. Friendly rain brings the narrator back to joy in life—the rebirth, or \""renascence\"", of the title."	Poem

The 2014 Kansas gubernatorial election took place on November 4, 2014, to elect the Governor of Kansas, concurrently with the election of Kansas' Class II U.S. Senate seat, as well as other elections to the United States Senate in other states and elections to the United States House of Representatives and various state and local elections. Incumbent Republican Governor Sam Brownback ran for re-election to a second term. He was opposed in the general election by Democrat Paul Davis, the Minority Leader of the Kansas House of Representatives, and Libertarian attorney Keen Umbehr. The election was viewed as a referendum on Brownback's aggressive tax cutting initiatives and his conservative values. The consensus among The Cook Political Report, Governing, The Rothenberg Political Report, Sabato's Crystal Ball, Daily Kos Elections, and others was that the contest was a tossup. Brownback won the election by a margin of 3.7%.	Election
The Battle of Thymbra was the decisive battle in the war between Croesus of the Lydian Kingdom and Cyrus the Great of the Achaemenid Empire. Cyrus, having pursued Croesus into Lydia following the drawn Battle of Pteria, met the remains of Croesus' partly disbanded army in battle on the plain north of Sardis on December, 547 BC. Even though Croesus' army was reinforced with many new men, Cyrus utterly defeated it, despite being outnumbered more or less 2:1. This proved decisive, and after the 14-day Siege of Sardis, the city and possibly its king fell, and Lydia was conquered by the Persians.	MilitaryConflict

His grandsire, Hyperion, was a six-time leading sire in Great Britain & Ireland. His dam, War Flower, was a daughter of Man o' War. Ace Admiral was born in the same year as the great Calumet Farm colts Citation and Coaltown. In his two-year-old season, Ace Admiral ran third to Citation in the Pimlico Futurity. Citation went on to dominate U.S. racing in 1947 and continued to master the competition in the Spring of 1948 leading up to the U.S. Triple Crown races. As such, like many other owners at the time, Maine Chance Farm felt it was in their best interest not to enter Ace Admiral in the Triple Crown races. Under trainer Jimmy Smith and jockey Ted Atkinson, Ace Admiral won a number of important races that year in New York, including the Lawrence Realization Stakes at Aqueduct Racetrack and the prestigious Travers Stakes at Saratoga Race Course. Sent to compete in California in 1949, Ace Admiral's training was handled by William Molter.

The Savoyan League (French: Ligue savoisienne, Arpitan: Liga de la Savouè) is a regionalist and populist political party based in Savoy, France. Founded in 1993, the party supports the independence of Savoy from France and the unification of the two departments of Savoy, named Savoie and Haute-Savoie, which have belonged to France since the Treaty of Turin in 1860. Formerly a member of the European Free Alliance, the party is generally pro-European in outlook, while lying on the right of the political spectrum. The League co-operates with the Savoy Region Movement, which does not support independence but rather federalism and Savoyard autonomism. In the 1998 regional elections, the League won 5.39% in Savoy (4.42% in Savoie and 6.05% in Haute-Savoie) and therefore won a seat in the Rhône-Alpes Regional Council. It did not participate in the 2004 regional elections. The party, however, holds one village, Margencel.	PoliticalParty

"108 North State Street is a site currently under development as an urban center located in the Loop community area of downtown Chicago, Illinois. The 3 building structure was being developed by Joseph Freed and Associates LLC, as a project inherited from the Mills Corporation. However, in 2011 Bank of America foreclosed on the property and sold it in 2012 to CIM Group. Retail development responsibilities were undertaken by Joseph Freed and Associates LLC. It is located on the square block bounded clockwise from the North by West Randolph Street, North State Street, West Washington Street and North Dearborn Street that is known as \""Block 37\"", which was its designated number as one of the original 58 blocks of the city. The project broke ground on November 15, 2005. On July 31, 2006, the construction phase began. July 2008 marked the opening of the first of the three structures and the shopping center opened in November 2009. The Mills Corporation has also been contracted to develop an underground transit center beneath Block 37 that will be jointly funded by the City of Chicago, the Chicago Transit Authority and The Mills Corporation. The planned project includes a new subway station, track connections and a common downtown airport check-in facility for train service to both O'Hare and Midway airports. Since the purchase in April 2007 the project has stalled. The CTA has pulled out of the project and the current economic climate has stalled the project. Delays in completion have caused the project to lose major tenants. Both Block 37 and The Mills Corporation have histories of financial difficulties. Block 37 had been demolished in 1989 for a hotly contested redevelopment plan under the then new Chicago Mayor Richard M. Daley. The debates included the demolition of the Chicago Landmark McCarthy Building, which proceeded after the Illinois Supreme Court decided private preservation groups did not have standing to challenge the city's decision. Once the site was cleared, the initial redevelopment plan fell through, as did several subsequent plans, leaving the block vacant and undeveloped for nearly a generation. The Mills Corporation has itself been in financial difficulty in the past. This reputation and changing financial climate caused a delay in 2006 as contractors feared not getting paid. During the construction, cost overruns and delays have forced the city of Chicago and the Chicago Transit Authority to make up for a shortfall of over $100 million. In November 2009, the developer was declared in default and CB Richard Ellis was named receiver. By February 2012, the building remained only 26 percent occupied due to the undesirability of leasing space in bankruptcy proceedings. Construction of the apartment tower began in October 2014. The retail spaces remained only 52 percent leased at the time."	ShoppingMall

Stephen III of Moldavia, known as Stephen the Great (Romanian: Ștefan cel Mare; pronounced [ˈʃtefan t͡ʃel ˈmare]) or Saint Stephen the Great (Romanian: Ștefan cel Mare și Sfânt; died on 2 July, 1504) was voivode (or prince) of Moldavia from 1457 to 1504. He was the son and co-ruler of Bogdan II of Moldavia who reigned from 1449 to 1451. After his father was murdered by his brother (Stephen's uncle), Peter III Aaron, Stephen fled to Hungary. He returned to Moldavia with the support of Vlad Dracula, Voivode of Wallachia and forced Peter Aaron to seek refuge in Poland in the summer of 1457. Teoctist I, Metropolitan of Moldavia, anointed him prince. Stephen continued to pay the yearly tribute that Peter Aaron had promised to send to the Ottoman Empire. He made a raid against Poland in 1458 to prevent the Poles from supporting Peter Aaron. In the following year, Stephen acknowledged the suzerainty of Casimir IV Jagiellon, King of Poland, who promised to stop defending Peter Aaron. Stephen decided to recapture Chilia (now Kiliya in Ukraine), an important port on the Danube, which brought him into conflict with Hungary and Wallachia. He tried to seize the town for the first time during the Ottoman invasion of Wallachia in 1462, but he was seriously wounded during the siege. Two years later, he captured the town. When the leaders of the Three Nations of Transylvania rebelled against Matthias Corvinus, King of Hungary, in 1467, Stephen promised them support against the king. After crushing the rebellion, Corvinus invaded Moldavia, but Stephen defeated him in the Battle of Baia. Stephen made raids against Hungary during the following years. Peter Aaron tried to regain Moldavia with Hungarian support in December 1470, but Stephen defeated him and ordered his execution. During his reign, he strengthened Moldavia and maintained its independence against the ambitions of Hungary, Poland, and the Ottoman Empire, which all sought to subdue the land. Stephen achieved fame in Europe for his long resistance against the Ottomans. He was victorious in 46 of his 48 battles, and was one of the first to gain a decisive victory over the Ottomans, at the Battle of Vaslui. Following this victory, Pope Sixtus IV deemed him verus christianae fidei athleta (true Champion of Christian Faith). He was a man of religion and displayed his piety when he paid the debt of Mount Athos to the Porte, ensuring the continuity of Athos as an autonomous monastic community.	Monarch

Colorino is a red Italian wine grape variety planted primarily in Tuscany. The grape is known for its deep dark coloring and is used primarily as a coloring agent in red blends. In the history of Chianti it played a minor role, mostly for its affinity and use to the governo winemaking technique. Like Canaiolo, Colorino did not rot easily while going through the partial drying process to later be added to the fermenting grape must. However the grape did not provide the same level of fruit and softening effect that Canaiolo did and fell out of favor. In the late 1980s, there was a surge of interest in the variety among Tuscan winemakers who saw in this local grape variety similarity to the role Petit Verdot plays in Bordeaux blends. Colorino was planted and used to add darker colors and structure from phenolic compounds in the grape's thick skin without the overpowering aromatics that Cabernet Sauvignon could add. This enthusiasm was short lived and by the turn of the 21st century Colorino returned once again to a minor role in Tuscan wines.	Grape

The Bagatelles, Op. 33, for solo piano were composed by Ludwig van Beethoven in 1801/02 and published in 1803 through the Viennese publisher Bureau des arts et d'industrie. The seven bagatelles are quite typical of Beethoven's early style, retaining many compositional features of the early Classical period. 1.  \n* The first Bagatelle, which is in the key of E-flat major, is perhaps the most well-known of the set. It is in the form of A–B–A. The A section starts with the right hand playing a soothing melody, and the left hand accompanying it with broken chords. The B section, which starts with the key of E-flat minor, plays a simple melody, then modulates to the original key with the B-flat major scale and then the E-flat major scale, then back to the A section. 2.  \n* The second Bagatelle, in C major, is the perhaps the second hardest of the set. It contains thirds scales, arpeggios, and a continuous left hand scale. 3.  \n* The third Bagatelle, in F major, starts off with the right hand playing the introduction and the left hand playing arpeggios. 4.  \n* The fourth Bagatelle, in A major, the middle section is in the key of A minor. 5.  \n* The fifth Bagatelle, which perhaps is the hardest of the set, is in the key of C major. It starts off with an arpeggios, a little similiar to Chopin's Etude Op.10 No.1. After the introduction, the right hand and the left hand play the melody with their 4th and 5th fingers. After the C minor section it goes back to the main theme. 6.  \n* The sixth Bagatelle, is in the key of D major. 7.  \n* The seventh and final Bagatelle, is in the key of A-flat major. It starts off with the left hand playing staccatos, and the right hand playing the melody.	ClassicalMusicComposition

"Kindercore Records is an independent record label based in Athens, Georgia, which was founded in 1996 by Ryan Lewis and Daniel Geller to document the emerging music scene in Athens, Georgia. Their first release was a cassette compilation called \""The Treble Revolution\"", which sold out in a week. This release was followed by Kindercore's first vinyl 7\"" by kincaid. Subsequent 7\"" singles were released including The Mendoza Line, Masters of the Hemisphere, and others. Although Kindercore was often called \""indiepop\"" by many, the label soon added the hip-hop influenced Kitty Craft to their roster (Kindercore's first Top 10 record at college radio), along with the alt-country tinged instrumental group, Japancakes. Also coming on board at that time was the restrained and acoustic based band, Vermont, a side project of The Promise Ring. With these new bands, Kindercore began to gain national attention. The label was approached by Emperor Norton Records who provided financial backing. With this support, Kindercore continued to sign talented artists from around the world, including Britain’s Birdie and The Real Tuesday Weld, Denver's Dressy Bessy and San Francisco’s Call and Response. In 2000, Spin Magazine named Kindercore the year’s “indie label to watch”. In 2000, Kindercore hosted the Athens Expo 2000, a showcase for their friends and bands that lasted for three days and drew visitors from all over the world to their hometown of Athens, GA. In 2002, Kindercore's agreement with Emperor Norton came to an end, and Kindercore entered into an agreement with The Telegraph Company. Geller and Lewis decided that they wanted to continue to broaden the scope of Kindercore's sound by signing new artists that reflected their evolving tastes. These included Maserati, Jet By Day, and Paper Lions. The relationship between Telegraph and Kindercore came to an abrupt end in October 2003 with a series of contradictory press releases about the fate of the company, alternately released by both Stan Hartman and Jerod Gunsberg. The press releases caused much confusion in the independent music community, and it quickly came to light that Geller and Lewis had little control over the company they had founded. Lewis and Geller took legal action and regained control over the Kindercore catalog. Lewis and Geller continue to live in Athens, GA. Lewis is a columnist for the Athens Banner-Herald and plays music. Geller continues to work with his band I Am The World Trade Center and works as a bio-diesel researcher for the University of Georgia. In August 2007 the Kindercore website was revamped to reflect the label's rebirth. The following recording artists have recently released material on other labels: Of Montreal is now on Polyvinyl Records, Dressy Bessy released Electrified on Transdreamer Records, I Am The World Trade Center released The Cover Up on Gammon Records, Maserati is now on Hello Sir Records, Jet By Day is now on Future Farmer Records, and Japancakes is now on Warm Records."

"Nicholas and Sharon Newman are fictional characters and a supercouple from the CBS soap opera The Young and the Restless. Nick is portrayed by Joshua Morrow and Sharon is portrayed by Sharon Case. The characters of Nick and Sharon first met in 1994 and soon became involved. They were faced with a range of problems, such as their different levels of class, Sharon's ex-boyfriend Matt Clark (Eddie Cibrian), and Sharon's secret past: she was pregnant three years earlier and gave up the child, Cassie (Camryn Grimes), for adoption. The couple married in February 1996, and after having a son, Noah (Robert Adamson), Sharon was reunited with Cassie. Nick grew to love Cassie and became her adoptive father. Sharon's best friend Grace Turner (Jennifer Gareis) developed an obsession with Nick and slept with him twice. In the following years, the couple dealt with the return of Matt Clark and infidelity on both sides among other obstacles, which Nick and Sharon managed to eventually move past. In 2005, Cassie was killed off in a car accident, which led to Nick's affair with Phyllis Summers (Michelle Stafford, Gina Tognoni). Nick impregnated Phyllis, who gave birth to a daughter named Summer (Hunter King), which ultimately meant the end of Nick and Sharon's marriage. Despite Nick's marriage to Phyllis and Sharon's marriages to Jack Abbott (Peter Bergman) and Nick's brother Adam Newman (Michael Muhney, Justin Hartley), Nick and Sharon's pattern of periodically getting back together and breaking up continued. A 2009 affair (while both were still married to others) resulted in the birth of another daughter, Faith (Alyvia Alyn Lind). The couple's marriage lasted for over ten years, which is considered a rarity in the soap opera genre. The couple is often referred to by the portmanteau \""Shick\"" by fans on internet, message boards and in magazines. The Huffington Post and Soap Opera Digest named them one of soap opera's greatest supercouples. Their 2009 on-screen reunion was a high-profile event on the show which garnered media attention, while lifting the show's ratings by nearly half a million viewers."	SoapCharacter

Soldier Summit is the name of both a mountain pass in the Wasatch Mountains in Utah and a ghost town located at the pass. Soldier Summit has been an important transportation route between the Wasatch Front and Price, Utah, since the area was settled by the Mormon pioneers. It is on the route of both U.S. Route 6 and the old main line of the Denver and Rio Grande Western Railroad (D&RGW), now owned and operated by the Union Pacific Railroad. Located where the road makes a brief bend through the extreme southwest corner of Wasatch County, Soldier Summit historically had more to do with nearby Utah County. At one time both the state highway department and the railroad had operations at the summit, but with the exception of a gas station that is sometimes open, the town site is now abandoned. Today it is a popular rest stop and photo spot for railfans. Many railfans also take pictures of the Gilluly loops, a series of horseshoe curves on the western approach to the summit. The California Zephyr Amtrak passenger train uses this route.	MountainPass

"Cougar Reservoir (also known as Cougar Lake) is a reservoir on the South Fork McKenzie River in the U.S. state of Oregon. It is in Lane County, 46 miles (74 km) east of Eugene and about 3 miles (5 km) south of the community of Rainbow in the Willamette National Forest. In 1963 the United States Army Corps of Engineers built Cougar Dam on the river primarily to generate hydroelectricity and control flooding, and the reservoir formed behind the dam. The lake is also used for recreation, including boating, fishing, swimming, and waterskiing. The United States Forest Service maintains three campgrounds—Cougar Crossing, Slide Creek, and Sunnyside—near the reservoir, with opportunities for hiking and picnicking as well as camping. Other campgrounds in the general vicinity include French Pete and Delta. Terwilliger Hot Springs is along Rider Creek just west of the lake. Cougar Reservoir supports populations of stocked rainbow trout and stocked landlocked Chinook salmon as well as naturally reproducing cutthroat trout. Fishing for rainbow trout, especially in winter, is said to be \""fair\"". The lake also supports bull trout, but it is not legal to catch and keep them."	Lake

"Errold Campbell La Frantz MBE (25 May 1919 – 20 February 2015) was an Australian cricket player, administrator, and commentator. He played a single first-class match for Queensland during the 1941–42 season. From Brisbane, La Frantz's sole match at state level came against New South Wales in November 1941, at a time when the Sheffield Shield competition was suspended. He was 22 at the time of his debut, and had played matches for Queensland Colts sides during the previous seasons. La Frantz, a left-handed batsman who bowled leg spin with the opposite hand, came in third in both innings of his first-class debut, behind openers Geoff Cook and Rex Rogers. He was bowled by Bill O'Reilly for six in the first innings, and made seven in the second innings before being dismissed in the same fashion by Ray Lindwall, who was also making his first-class debut. He was Lindwall's first, first class wicket. However La Frantz feared more Eddie Gilbert who La Frantz claimed was the fastest bowler of the generation. La Frantz told of facing Gilbert during a match while playing for Queensland Colts, and Gilbert's delivery thumped into the wicket keeper's gloves before La Frantz had had a chance to raise his bat past waist height. He was the only bowler ever to intimidate La Frantz in the \""pre-Bodyline\"" era.  La Frantz enlisted in the Australian Army less than two weeks later, and reached the rank of warrant officer class two by the end of the war with Mention in Dispatches In 1954, following the death of Tom Allen, La Frantz was made a Queensland state selector. He gained life membership of Toombul District Cricket Club, his club in the Brisbane Grade Cricket competition, in 1958, and life membership of the Queensland Cricket Association in 1971. He was also granted life membership of his beloved Nudgee Golf Club in later life. The owner of a Brisbane sports store, he was particularly prominent in junior cricket circles, and helped to organise the first formal junior association in Brisbane and he, along with best friend Ces Anstey considered the establishment and ongoing success of junior cricket in Queensland as their greatest legacy. From 1959 to 1973, La Frantz was a cricket commentator for ABC TV in Brisbane. In that capacity, he called the final over of the inaugural Tied Test, played at The Gabba in 1960. Through his business connections, in 1974 La Frantz secured a job for Australian Test player Jeff Thomson at a car dealership, which helped to secure his move from New South Wales to play for Queensland. He also lured other prominent players to Queensland at this time including Greg Chappell.  He was awarded the MBE for services to cricket in 1977, and also received the Australian Sports Medal in 2000. La Frantz died in Brisbane in February 2015, aged 95. At the time of his death, he was the oldest living Queensland player, and one of the oldest in Australia."	Cricketer

"The Church of St John the Evangelist, also known as St John's, is a Church of England church, in the Kates Hill area of Dudley, England. It opened in 1840 and closed in 2002 on safety grounds. It was Grade II listed by English Heritage on 21 May 2009. Two churches were built in Dudley at the same time and to similar designs by William Bourne; St John's and St James's, at Eve Hill. It was built when Kates Hill was still a relatively rural area, although it was soon a dense residential area following the construction of houses occupied by workers employed in local industry during the Industrial Revolution. The area became even more built up during the 1920s and 1930s when council housing was built nearby. In the years after the church's closure, \""St John's Church Preservation Group\"", whose patron is local historian Professor Carl Chinn, campaigned for the church to be repaired and reopened. The St John's Church Preservation Group became leaseholders of the church on 27 July 2016, and in August it was opened to the public for the first time since 2002.

"The men's super combined competition of the Vancouver 2010 Olympics was held at Whistler Creekside in Whistler, British Columbia.

American athlete Bode Miller won his only Olympic gold medal, Ivica Kostelić of Croatia won silver, and Silvan Zurbriggen of Switzerland took the bronze. One major change in this event for the 2010 Olympics was the switch from a traditional dedicated \""combined\"" (K), taking place over one or two days and involving a downhill run and two slalom runs (as the combined had been since its reintroduction to the Olympics in 1988), to a one-day \""super combined\"" (SC), consisting of a downhill run in the morning and one slalom run in the afternoon.

Lolo Pass is a mountain pass 6 miles (10 km) northwest of Mount Hood and 10 miles (16 km) northeast of Zigzag, Oregon, on the Clackamas–Hood River county line. It divides the Sandy River watershed on the southwest from the Hood River watershed on the northeast. At 3,415 feet (1,041 m), it provides a much lower crossing of the Cascade Range near Mount Hood than the 4,650-foot (1,420 m) Oregon Route 35 Bennett Pass on the southeast side. Access from the southwest side of the pass is paved all the way to the pass, where the road changes to gravel, heading down the northeast side of the pass. Lolo Pass Road (Forest Road 18) is closed due to heavy snow each winter. The road through the pass was initially established by Native Americans, as a trading route connecting the Willamette Valley and sites at the eastern end of the Columbia River Gorge like Celilo Falls. In 1838, Daniel Lee (nephew of missionary Jason Lee) drove livestock across the pass, while traveling east to establish a new Methodist station, named Wascopam Mission. He was the first westerner known to have used the trail. The trail was then used as one of the final legs of the Oregon Trail; settlers arriving from The Dalles would often drive their livestock over the pass while their families floated down the river. The 1846 construction of the Barlow Road provided a less daunting alternate route around the south side of Mount Hood. Lolo Pass is one of the milestones along the Pacific Crest Trail, though not a particularly low point for the region. By 5 miles (8 km) south of Lolo Pass, the Pacific Crest Trail drops to 2,800 feet (850 m) and much lower to the north at the Columbia River. A small campsite is located along the trail just south of the forest service road.	MountainPass

The Hon. Frank Finnan (23 September 1897 – 21 March 1966) was an Australian politician and a member of the New South Wales Legislative Assembly from 1941 until 1953 . He was a member of the Australian Labor Party and held numerous ministerial positions between 1947 and 1953. Finnan was born in The Rocks, New South Wales and was educated at St Aloysius' College (Sydney). He initially worked as a shearer in Queensland and was an official in the Australian Workers' Union. By 1930, Finnan had returned to Sydney and was involved in the management of Labor papers including Common Cause and the Labor Daily. He was elected to the New South Wales Parliament as the Labor member for Hawkesbury at the 1941 state election. The sitting United Australia Party member, Ronald Walker had retired and Finnan's victory helped Labor gain a majority at the election. He held the seat at the next 2 elections but a redistribution prior to the 1950 state election made the seat unwinnable for Labor. Finnan then successfully stood for the new seat of Darlinghurst. Darlinghurst was abolished at the 1953 election and Finnan was unsuccessful in an attempt to win the seat of Albury. He then retired from state politics. During the premierships of James McGirr and Joseph Cahill, Finnan held numerous ministerial positions including Minister for Tourism, and Minister for Labour and Industry and Social Welfare. Finnan then moved to Newcastle where he became president of the local water authority. In a sermon on the coronation of Queen Elizabeth II, the Anglican dean of Newcastle, Rev. W. A. Hardie, strayed from his subject to denounce Finnan's nomination as a blatant example of political corruption and 'spoils for the victor'. In 1960 he was appointed C.B.E. When he reached the statutory retiring age in 1962, the government passed special legislation enabling him to continue for another term. He retired from this role in 1964. Finnan was a council-member (1959–66) of Newcastle University College (University of Newcastle from 1965), chairman of the Hunter Valley Research Foundation, a member of the Newcastle Regional Development Committee and of the Newcastle International Sports Centre Trust, and a director of the Mater Misericordiae Hospital, Waratah. Finnan was also a patient of the same hospital and died there in 1966. There is a soccer field set named after him at Blackalls Park, Lake Macquaire, NSW. The soccer fields are on land owned by Hunter Water, and in fact directly next to a sewerage treatment plant, and a cricket field named Waterboard Oval.	PrimeMinister

"Amazing Nurse Nanako (菜々子解体診書 Nanako Kaitai Shinsho) is an anime OVA series released in Japan. There were 6 episodes. It was released in January 2003 in a DVD box-set in the United States through Geneon. The series details the life and history of Nanako Shichigusa, a 16-year-old who works as a maid (not nurse as the title might imply) in the hospital of Dr. Kyogi Ogami, the male lead. Nanako is a classic ditzy slapstick protagonist who tends to accidentally break things and do everything wrong. Ogami treats her frequently in a cruel or heartless manner—threatening her, yelling at her and even subjecting her to physical abuse—yet at the climax of every episode he comes through to rescue her from whatever predicament she got herself into. Much of the series revolves around the relationship between Nanako and Ogami—his mean veneer, her faith in him, and how he alternates between the evil mad scientist archetype and the knight in shining armor archetype. As the series progresses we are gradually revealed the history between Nanako and Ogami's family and given a reason why the two are so tightly knit together, as well as why the title refers to Nanako as a \""nurse\"". A minor supporting cast is introduced, though Nanako and Ogami are clearly the leads. The plot incorporates the American military, the Catholic Church and outlandish science fiction experiments, with these elements progressed mostly in the lead episode and the last two episodes. The middle episodes 2-4 feature mostly unrelated one-shot plots, though minor progress is made in each episode regarding the history between Nanako and Ogami's family."	Anime

Frederick Hinde Zimmerman (October 17, 1864 – September 21, 1924) was an American banker, farmer, real estate entrepreneur, businessman, and hotel owner. Due to his large land holdings and expertise in farming Zimmerman became a notable farmer, breeder, and real estate entrepreneur during his life. Zimmerman's farm, originally purchased by his grandfather Thomas S. Hinde from the federal government in 1815, included the Grand Rapids Dam, Hanging Rock, and Buttercrust. His first experience running a business was in 1883 when he ran a grocery store in Fort Smith, Arkansas with his cousin Harry Hinde. Many of Zimmerman's businesses centered on his family farm, but in later years Zimmerman achieved success through his ownership and investment in mines, banks, and real estate. He also owned or invested in the Hanging Rock and Grand Rapids Dam Farm Company, the Grand Rapids Hotel Park Company, and the Wabash Bull-Frog Mines Company. Zimmerman was among the fourth generation of the Hinde family in the United States that was begun by his great grandfather Dr. Thomas Hinde. His grandfather Thomas S. Hinde was a prominent politician and Methodist minister who contributed to the development of Illinois, Indiana, and the spread of the Methodist faith. His father Jacob Zimmerman held various political offices in the state of Illinois and in his early years owned several prominent Democratic newspapers in Ohio and Illinois right before the Civil War. At the age of one, Zimmerman's mother died and he was sent away to live with family in Ohio and did not see his father again until he was fourteen. Towards the end of his life, Zimmerman was elected to various positions of leadership in the Knights of Pythias and Illinois Farmers Institute. He was elected secretary of the Illinois Farmers Institute for multiple terms. During Zimmerman's life he managed banks, his family farm in Mount Carmel Precinct, Wabash County, Illinois, the Grand Rapids Hotel near the Grand Rapids Dam, and invested in numerous business ventures. The Grand Rapids Hotel was one of his most notable accomplishments and soon after opening in 1922 attracted tourists from across the United States. The hotel was one of the largest resorts in the Wabash Valley and at one time had fishing, trap shoots, baseball, golf, boating, swimming, a restaurant, and many other recreational activities. The hotel promoted the growth of the region by increasing the number of tourists and by hosting many large scale meetings and public events like celebrations at Hallowe'en, Christmas, and the Fourth of July. He died unexpectedly from complications of a broken hip that he suffered near the Grand Rapids Hotel in 1924 after falling out of his Model T automobile. Five years after Zimmerman died the hotel was burned to the ground. During the summer of 1929, Glenn Goodart, then manager of the hotel, burned down the hotel by dropping a blowtorch in the basement. The hotel was not rebuilt due to a lack of funds and the onset of the Great Depression.	OfficeHolder

The Yarraville Oval is an Australian rules football and cricket ground located on the corner of Williamstown Road and Anderson Street in Yarraville, Victoria. It is currently the home ground of the Yarraville/Seddon Eagles Football Club and the Yarraville Cricket Club. The ground was most notable as the home of the Yarraville Football Club throughout almost its entire existence in both the Victorian Junior Football Association from 1903 until 1927, and then in the Victorian Football Association from 1928 until 1982; the club played its games at the Western Oval in its final season in 1983. The ground was originally managed by a group of trustees, but management of the ground was transferred to the Footscray Council in 1928 to enable the ground to be upgraded to Association standards. The City of Maribyrnong, which incorporates the former City of Footscray, remains the ground manager. In 1942, Yarraville Oval was the home of the Footscray Football Club in the Victorian Football League because its normal home ground, the Western Oval, was being used as an army base, whilst the VFA was in recess until 1945. The Western Region Football League had its head office at the Oval until 2010.

The gorgeted woodstar (Chaetocercus heliodor) is a species of hummingbird in the Trochilidae family.It is found in Colombia and Venezuela, and also has an isolated population in Ecuador. Its natural habitats are subtropical or tropical moist montane forests and heavily degraded former forest. This species favors forested areas highly but can be seen at flowering trees in gardens and in semi-open. The tail is frequently wagged while feeding. This tiny bird is 7 cm (2.7 in) in total length, making it one of the smallest birds native to South America alongside the short-tailed woodstar and Esmeraldas woodstar. The gorgeted woodstar is dark shining green above with a short white postocular stripe and white patch on the sides of the lower back extending to the lower flanks. The male's gorget is glittering pinkish violet and has elongated, pointed sides that hang around the throat. The white pectoral collar is less eviden than in other woodstars. The breast is grayish and the belly is blue-green. The tail is forked and fairly short, with a spiky, narrow appearance. The female is similar overall but lacks the gorget and brighter coloration. There is limited overlap in the wild with the little woodstar but the female of that species is superficially indistinguishable from this one.	Bird

The normal depth of the lake is 47 feet (14 m) at its deepest point. This means the dam towers 100 feet (30 m) above the mean surface of the reservoir. The lake drains an area of more than 3,000 square miles (8,000 km2). The 1,500 acre (6 km2) lake has a conservation storage capacity of 27,000 acre·ft (0.033 km3) with a flood-control pool of over 350,000 acre·ft (0.43 km3) The reservoir is surrounded by Chatfield State Park, a recreation area with boating, horseback riding and camping. A secondary inflow from the south is Plum Creek. A tertiary inflow from the west is Deer Creek. There are 212 bird species that are frequently found at Chatfield Reservoir. These birds either permanently live there or just go there to rest after long migrations. There is a Chatfield bird watch list that anyone can access. The bald eagle, white pelican and burrowing owl have been seen.	Lake

"The 1930 FIFA World Cup was the inaugural FIFA World Cup, the world championship for men's national association football teams. It took place in Uruguay from 13 July to 30 July 1930. FIFA, football's international governing body, selected Uruguay as host nation, as the country would be celebrating the centenary of its first constitution, and the Uruguay national football team had successfully retained their football title at the 1928 Summer Olympics. All matches were played in the Uruguayan capital, Montevideo, the majority at the Estadio Centenario, which was built for the tournament. Thirteen teams (seven from South America, four from Europe, and two from North America) entered the tournament. Few European teams chose to participate because of the difficulty of travelling to South America. The teams were divided into four groups, with the winner of each group progressing to the semi-finals. The first two World Cup matches took place simultaneously, and were won by France and the United States, who defeated Mexico 4–1 and Belgium 3–0, respectively. Lucien Laurent of France scored the first goal in World Cup history, while American goalkeeper Jimmy Douglas posted the first official \""clean sheet\"" in the tournament. Argentina, Uruguay, the United States and Yugoslavia each won their respective groups to qualify for the semi-finals. In the final, hosts and pre-tournament favourites Uruguay defeated Argentina 4–2 in front of a crowd of 93,000 people, and became the first nation to win the World Cup."	SoccerTournament

“Shur”(Persian: شور‎‎) – is one of the great Dastgahs (a multifrequency vocal-instrumental composition) of seven main modes in Persian music. In comparison with Shur of the beginning of the 20th century, in the modern Shur many parts are not used. Modern Shur consists of parts (shobe) such as Maye, Kur-Shahnaz, Bayati-Kurd, Shikesteyi-fars, Mubarriga, Semayi-shems, Hijnaz, Sarenj and Nishibi-feraz. Some performers of Shur use little parts such as Buselik, Ashiran and Shah Khatai. Maximally shortened kind of Shur destgah includes 8 main parts: Berdasht, Maye, Shur-Shahnaz, Bayati-Turk, Shikesteyi-fars, Semayi-shems, Hijaz and Sarenj. These parts play a function of “bearing components” of the whole construction in the modern level and make a mode “skeleton” of the composition. There is also maqam Shur in Azerbaijani music. Mughams such as Shahnaz, Bayati-Kurd, Nava, Azerbaijani national songs and dance melodies and also Shur are based in this maqam. Azerbaijani composer Fikret Amirov composed “Shur” mugham on the basis of this Shur. A documentary of the same name, shot in 1967 by AzTV, is dedicated to “Shur” mugham.	MusicGenre

John William Flater (September 22, 1883 – March 20, 1970) was a Major League Baseball pitcher for the Philadelphia Athletics just at the end of the 1908 season (September 18 – October 3). The 5 ft 10 in (1.78 m), 175 lb. right-hander was a native of Sandymount, Maryland. Flater pitched in five games for the Athletics. He hurled complete games in all three of his starting assignments, and he finished two other games in relief. He pitched much better than his 1–3 record would indicate. In 39.1 innings he allowed only 49 baserunners (35 hits, 12 walks, and 2 hit batsmen), and just 9 of the 15 runs that scored against him were earned runs. His ERA was an excellent 2.06. He was pitching for a team, however, that won 68 games, lost 85, and made 272 errors, including 3 by Flater himself. The games he lost were by scores of 2–1, 3–2, and 5–4. Four of his famous teammates on the Athletics were future Hall of Famers Chief Bender, Eddie Collins, Jimmy Collins, and Eddie Plank. Flater died at the age of 87 in Westminster, Maryland, and is buried in nearby Sandymount, Maryland.	BaseballPlayer

"The Latin Kings, abbreviated TLK, was a Swedish hip hop group from the municipality of Botkyrka in the southern suburbs of Stockholm, Sweden. The members of the group are the lead rapper Dogge Doggelito (Douglas Léon) and the two brothers, Salla and Chepe. They all have roots in Latin America (Venezuela and Chile), which is why they took their name from the gang Latin Kings. They grew up in the concrete suburbs in Botkyrka where a large proportion of the population are immigrants and refugees and the poverty is more visible than elsewhere in Sweden. The hip hop subculture has a large following in these areas of Stockholm. Their songs reflect life in the less affluent suburbs. TLK were, in 1994, among the first to release a hip hop album with lyrics in Swedish (the first was Just D). Swedish rappers had before that time almost always used English. The debut album was Välkommen till förorten (Welcome to the suburb) and the very first single was \""Snubben\"" (The dude). The group felt like they had been \""ripped off\"" by their record company and they decided to start their own label, Red Line Records, on which they have signed a number of talented hip hop artists in Sweden such as Fattaru, Kalle Kath, Fjärde världen and Ison & Fille. If their contemporaries Infinite Mass were influenced by the West Coast sound, TLK has more of an East Coast flavor. The Latin Kings has become famous for rapping in the local Rinkeby Swedish, a \""multiethnolect language\"" that is used in areas with many immigrants. This is a form of Swedish with loanwords from Turkish, Aramaic, Spanish, Finnish, Persian, Arabic and other languages."	Band

George Clarence Charles Spriggs (28 January 1926 – 18 July 2015) was an Australian politician who was a Liberal Party member of the Legislative Assembly of Western Australia from 1977 to 1987, representing the seat of Darling Range.

In May 1971, Spriggs was elected to the Kalamunda Shire Council, where he would serve until 1977. He left the Country Party in 1972 and joined the Liberal Party, and at the 1977 state election won the seat of Darling Range (re-created after being abolished in 1974) with a large majority.

Pope Leo V (died c. February 904) was Pope from July 903 to his death in 904. He was pope during the period known as the Saeculum obscurum. He was thrown into prison in September 903 by the Antipope Christopher, and was probably killed at the start of the pontificate of Pope Sergius III. If his deposition is not considered valid (as in the modern Vatican list), then his papacy may be considered to have ended with his death in 904.	Pope

"Warren A. \""Jimmy\"" Croll, Jr. (March 9, 1920 – June 6, 2008) was an American Hall of Fame Thoroughbred race horse trainer. Croll was born in 1920 in Bryn Mawr, Pennsylvania. After finishing high school, he attended the University of Pennsylvania with the intention of becoming a veterinarian but left to pursue his passion for racing Thoroughbreds. In 1940 he obtained his trainers' license but his racing career was interrupted by service with the United States Army in the Pacific Theater of Operations during World War II. Upon the 1946 opening of the new Monmouth Park Racetrack in Oceanport, New Jersey, Croll relocated there and became a permanent part of that facility's annual summer campaign. In 1998, he received Monmouth Park's \""Raines Distinguished Achievement Award\"" given in memory of trainer Virgil W. Raines to an owner or trainer who has shown a dedication to the sport of Thoroughbred racing through exemplary conduct demonstrating professionalism and integrity. Best known as \""Jimmy\"" Croll, he earned his first graded stakes race win with War Phar in 1951. Although Croll has had a number of good horses, there are several that stand out: \n* Parka, the 1965 American Champion Male Turf Horse; \n* Forward Gal, the 1970 American Champion Two-Year-Old Filly; \n* Bet Twice, multiple graded stakes winner including the Belmont Stakes; \n* Housebuster, 1990 and 1991 American Champion Sprint Horse; \n* Holy Bull, 1994 American Horse of the Year and a United States Racing Hall of Fame ranked No. 64 in the Blood-Horse magazine List of the Top 100 U.S. Racehorses of the 20th Century. Jimmy Croll conditioned horses for Rachel Carpenter for 37 years. At the time of her death in August 1993, she owned Croll's most famous horse, the then unraced Holy Bull. Just a few hours before the two-year-old colt made his racing debut, Croll was notified by telephone that in her will, Rachel Carpenter had bequeathed him the seven horses under his care which included Holy Bull. In retirement, Croll and his wife made their home in Monmouth Beach, New Jersey. Croll died on June 6, 2008 after a long illness at Monmouth Medical Center in Long Branch, New Jersey."	HorseTrainer

"Nāder Šāh Afšār or Nadir Shah (Persian: نادر شاه افشار‎‎; also known as Nāder Qoli Begنادر قلی بیگ or Tahmāsp Qoli Khānتهماسپ قلی خان) (6 August 1698 – 19 June 1747) was one of the most powerful Iranian rulers in the history of that nation, ruling as Shah of Persia from 1736 to 1747 when he was assassinated during a rebellion. Because of his military genius as evidenced in numerous martial encounters throughout his campaigns, such as the battles of Herat, Mihmandust, Murche-Khort, Kirkuk, Yeghevard, Kheibar pass, Karnal and Kars, some historians have described him as the Napoleon of Persia or the Second Alexander. Nader Shah was an Iranian who belonged to the Turcoman Afshar tribe of Khorasan in northern-eastern Iran, which had supplied military power to the Safavid state since the time of Shah Ismail I. Nader rose to power during a period of anarchy in Iran after a rebellion by the Hotaki Afghans had overthrown the weak Shah Sultan Husayn, while the arch enemy of the Safavids, the Ottomans, as well as the Russians had seized Persian territory for themselves. Nader reunited the Persian realm and removed the invaders. He became so powerful that he decided to depose the last members of the Safavid dynasty, which had ruled Iran for over 200 years, and become shah himself in 1736. His numerous campaigns created a great empire that briefly encompassed what is now part of or includes Iran, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Georgia, the North Caucasus, Iraq, Turkey, Turkmenistan, Afghanistan, Tajikistan, Uzbekistan, Pakistan, North India, Oman and the Persian Gulf, but his military spending had a ruinous effect on the Persian economy. Nader idolized Genghis Khan and Timur, the previous conquerors from Central Asia. He imitated their military prowess and — especially later in his reign — their cruelty. His victories during his campaigns briefly made him West Asia's most powerful sovereign, ruling over what was arguably the most powerful empire in the world, but his empire and the Afsharid dynasty he founded quickly disintegrated after he was assassinated in 1747. The turning point in his military career started from his second and third campaigns against the by then revolting Lezgians, as well as other ethnic groups of Dagestan in the northwestern parts of his domain. Nader Shah has been described as \""the last great Asiatic military conqueror\""."	Monarch

The North-West Rebellion (or the North-West Resistance, Saskatchewan Rebellion, Northwest Uprising, or Second Riel Rebellion) of 1885 was a brief and unsuccessful uprising by the Métis people under Louis Riel, and an associated uprising by First Nations Cree and Assiniboine, of the District of Saskatchewan against the government of Canada. The Métis believed that Canada had failed to protect their rights, their land and their survival as a distinct people. Riel had been invited to lead the movement but he turned it into a military action with a heavily religious tone, thereby alienating the Catholic clergy, the whites, nearly all of the Indians and most of the Métis. He had a force of a couple hundred Métis and a smaller number of Indians at Batoche in May 1885, confronting 900 government troops. Despite some notable early victories at Duck Lake, Fish Creek and Cut Knife, the rebellion ended when the Métis were defeated at the siege of Batoche. The remaining Indian allies scattered. Riel was captured and put on trial. He was convicted of treason and despite many pleas across Canada for amnesty, he was hanged. Riel became the heroic martyr to Francophone Canada and ethnic tensions escalated into a major national division that was never resolved. Thanks to the key role that the Canadian Pacific Railway played in transporting troops, Conservative political support for it increased and Parliament authorized funds to complete the country's first transcontinental railway. Although only a few hundred people were directly affected in Saskatchewan, the long-term result was that the Prairie Provinces would be controlled by English speakers, not the French Canadians. A much more important long-term impact was the bitter alienation French speakers across Canada showed, and anger against the repression of their countrymen.	MilitaryConflict

Cesare Vecellio (c. 1530 – c. 1601) was an Italian engraver and painter of the Renaissance, active in Venice. He was the cousin of the painter Titian. Like Titian, he was born in Cadore in the Veneto. He accompanied Titian to Augsburg in 1548, and seems to have worked as his assistant. Many of Cesare's pictures were ascribed, perhaps knowingly, to Titian. In the Milan Pinacoteca there is a small Trinity by Cesare. He died in Venice. The crude woodcuts for book assembling contemporary fashion from across the world, De gli Habiti Antichi e Modérni di Diversi Parti di Mondo published in Venice in 1590 by Cesare as if they were his works, may in fact belong to Christopher Krieger from Nuremberg. They depict the garb, sometimes fanciful and imagined, of individuals, men and women, from Tsars to Tribeswomen from the Arabian Desert to Muscovite nobles to Arabian nobles to Inca nobles. Cesare also published a book of prints depicting the jewels of royal crowns, titled Corona delle nobili e virtuose donne (1591). Cesare's brother, Fabrizio di Cadore or Ettore, was little known beyond his native place, for the Council-hall of which he is said to have painted a fine picture. He died in 1580.	Painter
"The Tijuana Cultural Center (CECUT) is a cultural center in the Zona Río district of Tijuana, Mexico. The center opened 20 October 1982, and accommodates more than a million visitors per year. A major feature of the complex is an OMNIMAX cinema designed by architects Pedro Ramirez Vazques and Manuel Rossen Morrison. It is the only IMAX cinema in Tijuana, and has come to be popularly known as La Bola (\""The Ball\""). The cinema, which uses a 360-degree projector to surround viewers with a panoramic image, has 308 seats. The OMNIMAX cinema has been part of the cultural center since the complex first opened in 1982. In October of that year, it premiered the film El pueblo del sol, which was made especially for the cinema's opening. The film presents images from the most representative regions of Mexico, and got very good reviews. It was the cinema's only film for 13 years. Today, the center offers a daily selection of films; it premieres about four films per year. The center encompasses a large esplanade that accommodates up to 6,000 people. The esplanade is a venue for performances, festivals, and expos. There is also permanent exhibition, called \""Museo de las Californias\"", which stores over 200 pieces and is a walk through the history of the Baja Peninsula and the state of California from the prehistoric period until the first half of the 20th century. Also a pre-Hispanic garden, called \""Jardin Caracol (Snail Garden)\"", that contains sculptures from the different regions of the mesoamerican cultures that inhabited south Mexico before the arrival of the Spanish Army. Visitors can have the experience of going through the exhibition while enjoying a coffee since there is a little coffee shop in the garden. There is also a scenic theatre which has a room for around a thousand visitors and it is mostly used for private concerts and plays. There are also lecture rooms, video room, café, and a bookshop. There are several spaces for temporary small exhibits. In September 2008, on the eve of its 26th anniversary, CECUT opened its doors to a brand new building called \""El Cubo\"" (The Cube), so named because of the contrast between the nickname of the OMNIMAX cinema \""The Ball\"". This represented the very important opportunity for CECUT to start receiving International Exhibitions, and since then it has been the home for exhibitions that have traveled from other countries including Buda Guanyin, Gabriel Figueroa, Alice Rahon, Venus en Tijuana, Proyecto Civico, and Animated Painting among others. Nowadays this important institution has different programs for all ages, since classes for early stimulation for kids around 2 months and 2 years, plastic arts and artisan workshops for children from 5 to 15 years and concerts, conferences, movies, documentaries, exhibitions, and all kind of services for the whole family to enjoy the day and spend a nice time learning.

The Pacific goliath grouper (Epinephelus quinquefasciatus) is a large saltwater fish of the grouper family. It is related to the Atlantic goliath grouper. The Pacific goliath grouper is found primarily in shallow tropical waters among coral and artificial reefs at depths of up to 165 feet (50 m). Their range includes the East Pacific from the Gulf of California to Peru. Young groupers may live in brackish estuaries, and canals. They may reach extremely large sizes, growing to lengths of 8.2 feet (2.5 m) and can weigh as much as 800 pounds (363 kg). They are usually around 400 lb when mature. The goliath grouper's inquisitive and generally fearless nature make it a relatively easy prey for spear fishermen. They also tend to spawn in large aggregations returning like clockwork to the same locations making them particularly vulnerable to mass harvesting. Goliath groupers eat crustaceans, other fish, octopuses and young sea turtles. Grouper are preyed upon by large fish such as barracuda, moray eels and large sharks. Goliath groupers are believed to be protogynous hermaphrodites, with individuals first maturing as females and only some large adults becoming males. Most grouper follow this pattern, but it has not yet been verified for the goliath. In fact, Bullock et al. found that males could be sexually mature at smaller sizes (~1150mm) and younger ages (4-6 years) than females (~1225mm and ~6-8 years). The Goliath grouper has been listed as one of the top 10 most endangered fish species.	Fish

"The Battle of Kohima was the turning point of the Japanese U Go offensive into India in 1944 during the Second World War. The battle was fought in three stages from 4 April to 22 June 1944 around the town of Kohima in Nagaland in northeast India. From 3 to 16 April, the Japanese attempted to capture Kohima ridge, a feature which dominated the road by which the besieged British and Indian troops of IV Corps at Imphal were supplied. By mid-April, the small British and Indian force at Kohima was relieved. From 18 April to 13 May, British and Indian reinforcements counter-attacked to drive the Japanese from the positions they had captured. The Japanese abandoned the ridge at this point but continued to block the Kohima–Imphal road. From 16 May to 22 June, the British and Indian troops pursued the retreating Japanese and reopened the road. The battle ended on 22 June when British and Indian troops from Kohima and Imphal met at Milestone 109, ending the Siege of Imphal. The battle is often referred to as the \""Stalingrad of the East\"". In 2013, the British National Army Museum voted the Battle of Imphal and Kohima to be \""Britain's Greatest Battle\""."

Suillus pungens, commonly known as the pungent slippery jack or the pungent suillus, is a species of fungus in the genus Suillus. The fruit bodies of the fungus have slimy convex caps up to14 cm (5.5 in) wide. The mushroom is characterized by the very distinct color changes that occur in the cap throughout development. Typically, the young cap is whitish, later becoming grayish-olive to reddish-brown or a mottled combination of these colors. The mushroom has a dotted stem (stipe) up to 7 cm (2.8 in) long, and 2 cm (0.8 in) thick. On the underside on the cap is the spore-bearing tissue consisting of minute vertically arranged tubes that appear as a surface of angular, yellowish pores. The presence of milky droplets on the pore surface of young individuals, especially in humid environments, is a characteristic feature of this species. S. pungens can usually be distinguished from other similar Suillus species by differences in distribution, odor and taste. The mushroom is considered edible, but not highly regarded. An ectomycorrhizal species, S. pungens forms an intimate mutualistic relationship between its underground mycelium and the young roots of the associated host tree. The fungus—limited in distribution to California—fruits almost exclusively with Monterey and bishop pine, two trees with small and scattered natural ranges concentrated in the West Coast of the United States. Several studies have investigated the role of S. pungens in the coastal Californian forest ecosystem it occupies. Although the species produces more fruit bodies than other competing ectomycorrhizal fungi in the same location, it is not a dominant root colonizer, and occupies only a small percentage of ectomycorrhizal root tips. The fungus's propensity to fruit prolifically despite minimal root colonization is a result of its ability to efficiently transfer nutrients from its host for its own use.	Fungus
"Dominick A. \""Dom\"" Flora (born June 12, 1935) is an American former college basketball standout at Washington and Lee University (W&L), located in Lexington, Virginia. Flora played for the W&L Generals from 1954–55 to 1957–58. Dom Flora was a native of Jersey City, New Jersey and played high school basketball for William L. Dickinson High School. A point guard, Flora was an explosive scorer whose accurate jump shot and crisp ball-handling ability helped him average 21 points per game for his career. He was able to score despite being double– and triple–teamed by opposing defenses, and his aggressive style of play led him to become one of the most prolific free throw shooters in NCAA Division I history. As of the conclusion of the 2011–12 season, Flora's 696 free throws made are still in the top 25 all-time in Division I history. He shot 696-for-954 (73.0%) in 109 career games played. As a senior in 1957–58, Flora was named the Southern Conference Player of the Year, the Virginia Big Six Player of the Year, and a First Team All-America selection by the Helms Foundation. He also earned his second straight First Team All-Southern Conference selection. When his career ended, Flora finished with 2,310 points, which at the time was the fifth–highest total in NCAA history. He also played baseball all four years while at W&L. Bill Brill, a sports writer for The Roanoke Times & World News, once wrote about Flora: \""Flora left the fans gasping with one bit of razzle-dazzle, on which he dribbled with his left hand, jumped into the air, switched the ball behind his back to his right hand, and made a jump shot.

'Beauty of Bath' is a dessert apple cultivar. It was propagated in 1864 by George Cooling and awarded an Royal Horticultural Society First Class Certificate in 1887. 'Beauty of Bath' is a very early apple usually cropping in August but can crop as early as July (e.g. in 2011) or last into September. It bruises easily, so is best picked by hand. Fruits can drop early by themselves, often when not completely ripe. Traditionally, straw was placed under the trees to lessen damage to falling fruit. The fruit's taste is sharp at first but sweetens later. The flesh is white but sometimes has a red flush under the skin (approximately 20% occurrence noticed in 2011 in one orchard). The tree is in flowering group 2 with pale pink blossom and medium to large, blue green, leaves.	CultivatedVariety
"WWSJ (\""Joy 1580 & 100.3\"") is an AM radio station broadcasting from St. Johns, Michigan on 1580 kHz, featuring a black gospel format. The station transmits with 1,000 watts during the day using a directional antenna that sends the signal primarily to the north and south (including Lansing, Michigan). At night it operates with a mere 3 watts, but still manages to cover much of Clinton County. In the summer of 2010, WWSJ began to simulcast on translator W262BD 100.3 FM licensed to Dimondale, Michigan, enabling it to get clearer FM coverage of the Lansing area day and night. W262BD operates with 22 watts from a transmitter in the heart of Lansing; despite being licensed to Dimondale, its primary signal contour does not actually reach Dimondale. W262BD is owned by Educational Media Foundation and had previously operated using EMF's Air 1 format; although EMF continues to own the translator, it is being programmed by the owners of WWSJ."

"\""The Gypsy Cried\"" is a song written by Twyla Herbert & Lou Christie, using his actual name Lugee Sacco, which was released by Lou Christie in 1962. The name \""Lou Christie\"" was chosen by C & C Records, and \""The Gypsy Cried\"" was credited to \""Lou Christie\"" before they had consulted with Sacco about the name. The song was the first song that Herbert and Christie wrote together, written over a period of 15 minutes, and was Lou Christie's first hit. The song was initially released by Pittsburgh-based C & C Records, and was a local hit in Pittsburgh, but it was soon picked up by Roulette Records and became a national hit. The song spent 13 weeks on the Billboard Hot 100 chart, peaking at No. 24 on March 16, 1963, while reaching No. 3 on Canada's CHUM Hit Parade."	Single

Harranahynchus is an extinct genus of sclerorhynchid (Family Sclerorhynchidae) sawfish from the late Maastrichtian deposits of the Muwaqqar Chalk Marl Formation of Harrana in Jordan. The genus is so far represented by a single species, Harranahynchus minutadens and named after its minute rostral and dental battery teeth that do not exceed two millimeters in length, a size that is significantly smaller than the rostral teeth of any other modern or extinct sawfish species. Harranahynchids were medium-sized benthic predators around 2-2.5 meters in length and lived in the shallow offshore subtropical marine waters of the southern Tethys Ocean alongside other sclerohynchid sawfishes such as Schizorhiza stromeri Weiler, 1930.

His suit sought the High Court to declare that Nana Akufo-Addo was never called to the Ghana Bar and that his private law firm was thus also illegal. This upset many in the NPP including the former President John Kufuor. He was also subjected to various attacks through the media to which he responded that he would like Nana Akufo-Addo to go through the court process in answering back.	Judge

Leslie Kwok Ying Wah (born 12 November 1973) is a Singaporean former swimmer, who specialized in sprint freestyle events and later turned into an actor, entrepreneur, and a part-time professional model. He earned three bronze medals each in the 50 m freestyle from the Southeast Asian Games, and later represented Singapore at the 2000 Summer Olympics. Kwok is also an Anglo-Chinese School alumnus, and later a graduate with a bachelor of science degree in civil and structural engineering at Nanyang Technological University. Kwok competed for Singapore in the men's 50 m freestyle at the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney. He achieved a FINA B-cut of 23.72 from the Southeast Asian Games in Bandar Seri Begawan, Brunei. He challenged seven other swimmers in heat four, including Kyrgyzstan's Sergey Ashihmin, Goodwill Games silver medalist for Russia, and Kazakhstan's two-time Olympian Sergey Borisenko. Diving in with a 0.73-second deficit, Kwok scorched the entire race to share a fourth seed with Peru's Luis López Hartinger in an exact time of 24.00, but finished outside an entry standard. Kwok failed to advance into the semifinals, as he placed forty-ninth overall in the prelims. At the 2005 Southeast Asian Games in Manila, Kwok added a third bronze to his six-year-old hardware in the 50 m freestyle (23.58), finishing behind Indonesia's veteran Richard Sam Bera and Thailand's newcomer Arwut Chinnapasaen by more than half a second (0.50). In early 2006, Kwok announced his official retirement from swimming to extend his resume in entrepreneurship and other lifestyle businesses. As a part-time professional model, he has appeared in several sports magazines, print ad campaigns, and TV commercials, and has featured on the cover of a popular Asian woman magazine Female. A top-class entrepreneur, Kwok currently owns a massage and health spa called Elements Spa & Slimming, founded in April 2002.	Swimmer

Sir William Godolphin, 1st Baronet (c. 1640 – 27 August 1710), of Godolphin in Cornwall, was an English Member of Parliament. He was the eldest son of Sir Francis Godolphin, KB, who had been a Member of Parliament until being barred from sitting because of his Royalist sympathies during the Civil War, and who after the Restoration was knighted in reward for his loyalty. Probably also in token of Sir Francis's services, William was created a baronet on 29 April 1661. He represented the family borough of Helston in Parliament from 1665 until 1679, but his career was overshadowed by that of his younger brother, Sidney, who rose to be First Lord of the Treasury and was granted a peerage and later an earldom; another brother, Henry, took holy orders and ended as Dean of St Paul's and Provost of Eton. Sir William died unmarried, and the family estates passed to his brother.	Baronet

Empress Kōgyoku (皇極天皇 Kōgyoku-tennō, 594–661), also known as Empress Saimei (斉明天皇 Saimei-tennō), was the 35th and 37th monarch of Japan, according to the traditional order of succession. Kōgyoku's reign spanned the years from 642 to 645. Her reign as Saimei encompassed 655 to 661. In other words, \n*  642: She ascended the throne as Kōgyoku-tennō, and she stepped down in response to the assassination of Soga no Iruka (see: Isshi Incident). \n*  645: She abdicated in favor of her brother, who would become known as Emperor Kōtoku \n*  654: Kōtoku died; and the throne was vacant. \n*  655: She re-ascended, beginning a new reign as Saimei-tennō. \n*  661: Saimei ruled until her death caused the throne to be vacant again. The two reigns of this one woman spanned the years from 642 through 661. In the history of Japan, Kōgyoku/Saimei was the second of eight women to take on the role of empress regnant. The sole female monarch before Kōgyoku/Saimei was Suiko-tennō. The six women sovereigns reigning after Kōgyoku/Saimei were Jitō, Genmei, Genshō, Kōken/Shōtoku, Meishō, and Go-Sakuramachi.	Monarch
The Bellevue Bridge (known as the Bellevue Toll Bridge and officially called the Grand Army of the Republic Bridge) is a continuous truss bridge over the Missouri River connecting Mills County, Iowa and Sarpy County, Nebraska at Bellevue, Nebraska. The bridge connects Nebraska Highway 370 and Iowa Highway 370. The bridge was built in 1950 by the Bellevue Bridge Commission at a cost of $2.8 million. The bridge charges $1 tolls for cars and is 20 feet (6.1 m) wide. Although the bridge is considered obsolete there are no current plans to replace it. Various government entities have sparred over who should own the bridge (nobody wants the expense of owning it) when the initial bonds were to be paid off in the 2000. The issue has been temporarily resolved since the Bridge Commission has had to seek more than $1 million in bonds for repairs to the bridge.	Bridge

The Blackall Range is a mountain range in South East Queensland, Australia. The first European explorer in the area was Ludwig Leichhardt. It was named after Samuel Blackall, the second Governor of Queensland. The Blackall Range dominates the hinterland area of the Sunshine Coast, west of Nambour. Maleny, Mapleton, Montville and Flaxton are the main settlements located on the range. The Stanley River rises from the southern slopes. Baroon Pocket Dam is a reservoir on Obi Obi Creek which drains the north west slopes of the range. Mary Cairncross Reserve marks the site of the first settler's house on the Blackall Range. Curramore Sanctuary, Mapleton Falls National Park and Kondalilla National Park are also located on the range. Numerous lookouts on the range provide excellent views towards the coast. One of the best is located at Howells Knob, a mountain which rises 561 m above sea level. With its spectacular views, natural beauty and an established tourist industry providing accommodation, restaurants, art galleries and specialty shops, the Blackall Range is a popular tourist destination. Rich timber resources in the area attracted timber-cutters in 1860s. The last logging on the range occurred in 1939. The Blackall and Bunya Mountains ranges are the only two locations where the bunya pine species of tree is found naturally. Activities by community groups with the support of the Queensland Government succeeded in recognising the range with iconic status, meaning the area is given greater environmental protection. In mid-2008 iconic status was confirmed, making the Blackall Range the third such declaration in Queensland after Noosa and Port Douglas.	MountainRange

"George Washington Glick (July 4, 1827 – April 13, 1911) was the ninth Governor of Kansas. George Washington Glick was raised on his father's farm near Greencastle, Ohio. He enlisted for service in the Mexican–American War, but saw no action. At age 21 he entered the law offices of Buckland and Hayes (later President Rutherford B. Hayes); he was admitted to the bar two years later and established a moderate law practice, earning a reputation as a hard-working lawyer. Glick moved to Atchison, Kansas, in 1859 and formed a partnership with Alfred P. Otis. He served as a Union soldier in the 2nd Kansas Infantry during the Civil War. Elected to the Kansas State Legislature in 1862, he served for 14 of the next 18 years and was Speaker pro tempore in 1876. He served in both houses of the state legislature. Glick was well respected and considered \""just and expert\"" by his colleagues. He was elected Governor in 1882 and served until 1885. Legislation enacted during his tenure included the creation of a railroad commission, a \""good roads\"" law, reassessment of tax laws, and the establishment of a livestock sanitary commission. He was later appointed pension agent in Topeka by President Grover Cleveland. After 15 years of civic service, George Glick was forced to abandon his political career because of a throat infection that nearly destroyed his ability to speak. He continued, however, as an attorney for various railroads. He also managed his farm and served as a charter member and first vice president of the Kansas Historical Society. Glick died in 1911 in Atchison, Kansas."	Governor

Schalke's 16–0 win over SC Kassel 03 in the group stages was the highest win in the history of the German championship as well as the most goals scored in a game. Rapid Wien's Franz Binder became the 1940 championships top scorer with 14 goals, a new record that would be broken the following year by Schalke's Hermann Eppenhoff when he scored 15 goals. The eighteen 1939–40 Gauliga champions, the same number as in 1939, competed in a group stage with the four group winners advancing to the semi-finals. The two semi-final winners then contested the 1940 championship final. The groups were divided into three with four clubs and one with six clubs with the latter, in turn, subdivided into two groups of three teams each and a final of these group winners to determine the overall group champions. In the following season, the German championship was played with twenty clubs. From there it gradually expanded further through a combination of territorial expansion of Nazi Germany and the sub-dividing of the Gauligas in later years, reaching a strength of thirty-one in its last completed season, 1943–44.

In Greek mythology, Lichas /ˈlaɪkəs/ was the Spartan who discovered the bones of Orestes. The remains of Orestes were required, according to a Delphic Oracle, in order for Sparta to defeat Tegea (Herodotus The Histories 1.68). Another Spartan named Lichas lived in the late fifth century B.C. During the Pentecontaetia, Cimon was becoming more and more powerful among the Athenians as he began to spend money to feed the poor, regularly inviting them into his home, and spending more on honoring gods such as Hermes. Seeing the popularity he was gaining in this manner, the younger Lichas began to finance and organize festivals in order to entertain boys involved in gymnastics. In this way he gained popularity in Sparta.	MythologicalFigure

Andromeda IV (And IV) is an isolated irregular dwarf galaxy. The moderate surface brightness, a very blue color, low current star formation rate and low metallicity are consistent with it being a small (background) dwarf irregular galaxy, perhaps similar to Local Group dwarfs such as IC 1613 and Sextans A. Arguments based on the observed radial velocity and the tentative detection of the RGB tip suggest that it lies well outside the confines of the Local Group. Further study using the Hubble space telescope has shown it to be a solitary irregular dwarf galaxy. The galaxy is between 22 and 24 million light years from Earth, and so is not close to the Andromeda Galaxy at all. The galaxy is severely isolated. The Holmberg diameter is 1880 parsecs, but neutral atomic hydrogen gas extends more than eight times further out in a disk. The galaxy is very dark, and the baryonic mass to dark matter ratio is 0.11.	Galaxy

"Operation Masher (24 January—6 March 1966) was in early 1966 the largest search and destroy mission that had been carried out in the Vietnam War up until that time. It was a combined mission of the United States Army, Army of the Republic of Vietnam (ARVN), and Republic of Korea Army (ROKA) in Binh Dinh province on the central coast of South Vietnam. The 3rd Division of the communist North Vietnamese Army, made up of two regiments of North Vietnamese regulars and one regiment of main force Viet Cong guerrillas, controlled much of the land and many of people of Binh Dinh province which had a total population of about 800,000. A CIA report in 1965 said that Binh Dinh was \""just about lost\"" to the communists. The name \""Operation Masher\"" was changed to \""Operation White Wing\"", because President Lyndon Johnson wanted the name changed to one that sounded more benign. Adjacent to the operational area of Masher/White Wing in Quang Ngai province the U.S. and South Vietnamese Marine Corps carried out a complementary mission called Operation Double Eagle. The 1st Cavalry Division (Airmobile) was the principal U.S. ground force involved in Operation Masher. 228 Americans of the lst cavalry were killed and another 46 died in an airplane crash; 834 were wounded.

The 2010–11 season was the 100th season in Hajduk Split’s history and their twentieth in the Prva HNL. Their second-place finish in the 2009–10 season meant it was their 20th successive season playing in the Prva HNL. It was the third tenure for manager Stanko Poklepović at Hajduk, after he was appointed following Edoardo Reja's departure to Lazio in February 2010. Poklepović won the Croatian Cup's previous season, his third silverware. The season covers a period from 1 June 2010 to 31 May 2011. There were no arrivals during the pre-season transfer window, with players leaving the club or reducing their contractual obligations to ease the club's financial situation. The season started with an eleven-match unbeaten league run, but after three successive defeats in all three competitions during the October, Poklepović was sacked. Youth team coach Goran Vučević was appointed as caretaker manager and eventually signed a two-and-a-half-year contract in December. A four-match run without victory, which started with a defeat by rivals Dinamo Zagreb that diminished hope for a championship title, saw Vučević leaving the club on mutual consent. Ante Miše was appointed as his successor until the end of the season, in which time he won two out of five remaining matches. Hajduk finished the season in 2nd place in the Prva HNL behind Dinamo Zagreb for the third consecutive time. The board of directors chose not to extend the contract of Miše, and at the end of May, Krasimir Balakov was appointed as new manager. The club reached the group stage of the UEFA Europa League, eliminating Dinamo Bucharest and Unirea Urziceni in progress. They finished in the last place, winning only one match, against Anderlecht. Hajduk reached the second round of the Croatian Cup, where the team were beaten 1–0 in the extra time by Istra 1961. Ante Vukušić was the club's top goalscorer after scoring 18 goals, with 14 in the league and four in the Europe.	SoccerClubSeason
The Stikine Icecap (sometimes referred to as the Stikine Icefield) is a large icefield straddled on the Alaska–British Columbia boundary in the Alaska Panhandle region. It lies in the Boundary Ranges of the Coast Mountains. Within the United States, most of it is under the administration of the Tongass National Forest and is part of the Stikine-LeConte Wilderness within the national forest. An extremely large icefield, the icecap is a primary source for both the Taku River, which forms its northern boundary, and the Taku's southern tributaries, and also the Stikine River and its lower western tributaries, notably the Chutine, which form its southern and southwestern boundary, respectively. The Stikine Icecap is the parent icefield of the LeConte and Sawyer Glaciers on its US side, and the Great Glacier on its Canadian side. Also on the Canadian side and entering the lower Stikine, like the Great Glacier, are the Mud and Flood Glaciers, which form the boundaries of the small Boundary Range, which is an eastern abutment of the range comprising the Stikine Icecap and marks the approximate boundary claimed by the United States prior to the Alaska Boundary Settlement of 1903. The Stikine Icecap area is also renowned for its technically demanding and dangerous peaks and spires of granite that have garnered comparisons as North America's version of Patagonia. Peaks of particular renown include Devils Thumb, Witches Tits, Cat's Ears, and the Burkett Needle. Most expeditions into the region usually depart from Petersburg, Alaska.	Glacier

"Taquan Air is the operating name for Venture Travel, LLC, an American regional airline headquartered in Ketchikan, a city in the southeastern portion of the U.S. state of Alaska. It operates domestic scheduled passenger and charter services. Its base is Ketchikan Harbor Seaplane Base, which shares the same harbor and airspace as Ketchikan International Airport. As per the United States Department of Transportation in a report dated August 2, 2010, Taquan Air is a \""U.S. Certificated Air Carrier\"", and is 1 of 125 such carriers in the US. Taquan Air's heyday was in 1997 when they were the largest floatplane company in the world and the second largest air commuter service in Alaska, carrying 243,000 passengers that year. In a continuing effort to grow, they sought FAR part 121 certification, allowing them to carry more than nine passengers on a flight. They achieved certification and began flights in 1998, but the costs of the new venture and economic factors led to the sale of assets and layoffs in 1999. New ownership in 2000 kept the company name alive, and Taquan remains known for their floatplanes. Taquan Air's flight schedule provides for the delivery of US Mail, and includes service to the fourth-largest island in the US, Prince of Wales Island; and the easternmost town in Alaska, Hyder. An accident in 2007 associated with a raincloud has led to the installation of weather cameras throughout Alaska. Taquan Air, along with other Ketchikan flight services, provides \""flightseeing\"" tours over pristine Misty Fjords National Monument, and bear viewings within the Earth's largest remaining temperate rainforest, Tongass National Forest."

Catacomb 3-D (also known as Catacomb 3-D: A New Dimension, Catacomb 3-D: The Descent, and Catacombs 3) is the third in the Catacomb series of video games (created by the founders of id Software), and the first of these games to feature 3D computer graphics. The game was originally published by Softdisk under the Gamer's Edge label, and is a first-person shooter with a dark fantasy setting. The player takes control of the high wizard Petton Everhail, descending into the catacomb of the Towne Cemetery to defeat the evil lich Nemesis and rescue his friend Grelminar. Catacomb 3-D is a landmark title in terms of first-person graphics. The game was released in November 1991 and is arguably the first example of the modern, character-based first-person shooter genre, or at least it was a direct ancestor to the games that popularized the genre. It was released for DOS with EGA graphics. The game introduced the concept of showing the player's hand in the three-dimensional viewpoint, and an enhanced version of its technology was later used for the more successful and well-known Wolfenstein 3D. The game's more primitive technological predecessor was Hovertank 3D.	VideoGame

In 2010, it was the world's 18th largest corporation, according to the Fortune Global 500 list, the rankings are based on revenues, accounted for as the sum of gross interest income and gross non.

FIFA Manager (short: FIFAM) was an association football series of sport management games published by Electronic Arts. The games were developed by the German studio Bright Future GmbH and EA Sports. The game was called Total Club Manager (short: TCM) until the name changed to FIFA Manager with the FIFAM 06. It was announced FIFA Manager's last installment was FIFA Manager 14 and that there would be no further editions to the game. Before FIFAM and TCM, EA Sports released FIFA Soccer Manager (1997) and The FA Premier League Football Manager 99, 2000, 2001 and 2002, but while the first managed to attract some attention, the latter were released when the managing games market for non-Championship Manager titles was close to non-existent, and after two unsuccessful titles, it was dropped. However, by 2001, several employees of German software house Ascaron, who developed the highly popular Anstoss series in the past moved to EA, and the first game, Fussball Manager 2002, was released in Germany only, as a test for a potential series. It resembled Anstoss 3, although on a more serious note (in Anstoss, players could be abducted by aliens, train in Area 51 or use performance-enhancing drugs) and fewer financial options (managers developed by German teams often include deep financial options, such as stock and real estate markets). The game had positive reception, and a year later Total Club Manager 2003 was released, with Bobby Robson on the cover (for the second time, after FIFA Soccer Manager). One of the key features of Anstoss 3 was the ability to actually play the games after Anstoss Action was released. Although it could be played as a stand-alone game, it only reached the full potential when used with the manager game. This feature, only present on other games with limited geographical distribution, the Spanish PC Fútbol, was included for buyers of both TCM 2004 and FIFA 2004, which could use the Football Fusion function. Some fans managed to control games in TCM 2003 by hacking the configuration files, but data loss and corruption was frequent. Celtic manager Martin O'Neill appeared on the cover of TCM 2004. Criticized by a confusing interface, EA reworked it for TCM 2005, with a more sleek design. European Champion with former FC Porto and Chelsea manager José Mourinho was selected for the main cover. While the TCM series has been released for Windows, Xbox and PlayStation 2, the FIFAM series is only available for Windows. The PlayStation 2 and Xbox versions of the game were developed for EA Canada by Budcat Creations.	VideoGame

"The Tropical Sun was South Florida's first newspaper, established in 1891 and based in Juno Beach, Florida. Founded by Guy Metcalf, the paper was published in Juno, which was the county seat of Dade County (which then extended from modern-day Martin County south to Dade's southern boundary at Florida Bay). The Tropical Sun was the pioneer's tie to the outside world, and later covered the events of the Florida land boom of the 1920s and its subsequent bust in preceding the Great Depression in South Florida. Byrd Spilman Dewey served as its first columnist, writing \""The Sitting Room\"" column under the pen name \""Aunt Judith.\"" It also documents the growth of tourism, the presence of malaria in Florida prior to World War II, and other issues related to the struggles of the developers of south Florida’s Atlantic coast. The only rival to the Tropical Sun was The Miami Metropolis, which eventually became The Miami News, and The Miami Evening Record.The Tropical Sun was published as a weekly for most of its history but, also, as a semiweekly between 1903 and 1906. Miami and Dade County saw an increase in tourists after 1906 when Henry Flagler’s railroad opened service to Key West. Before this date, tourist traffic to Key West would have involved travel by city. The location of The Tropical Sun's offices in Juno, Florida, \""set back from the (railroad) track some thirty feet and from the wharf about fifty yards\"" is telling of both the newspaper’s and south Florida’s relationship with and their reliance on tourism. Between 1891 and 1895, The Tropical Sun was published in Juno, Florida. From 1895 to 1926, it was published in West Palm Beach, Florida. For a time beginning in 1914, the newspaper published both as a weekly under The Tropical Sun title and as a daily under the title, the Daily Tropical Sun. Archives of the newspaper today are kept by the Historical Society of Palm Beach County in the basement of the 1916 Palm Beach County Courthouse."	Newspaper
CANAL8 Sport was a Danish television channel owned by TV4 Group and C More Entertainment. The channel was announced on July 3, 2012. The channel replaced Canal+ Sport 1 in Denmark. The reason for this is that after Canal+ lost the rights to the Premier League in 2010, they have a hard time keeping the subscribers in Denmark to their premium sports package.And thus it was decided to move the most popular sport with Danish viewer interest from a high pay channel to an advertising financing low pay channel. the channel is first of all a football channel and show matches from Danish Superliga, UEFA Europa League, La Liga, Serie A and Eredivisie and other sports like UFC fighting, ATP Tennis, Indycar Racing and Swedish Hockey League. Following this decision, the C More Sports package was not made available in Denmark. An HD version of Canal 8 Sport was launched on June 3, 2013. In the summer of 2015, Discovery Networks Northern Europe purchase the channel, and on July 1, 2015 it merges with Eurosport 2 into a new sportschannel called Eurosport DK.	TelevisionStation

The 1967 Piccadilly World Match Play Championship was the fourth World Match Play Championship. It was played from Thursday 12 to Saturday 14 October on the West Course at Wentworth. Eight players competed in a straight knock-out competition, with each match contested over 36 holes. The champion received £5,000 out of a total prize fund of £16,000. In the final Arnold Palmer defeated Peter Thomson at the 36th hole to win the tournament for the second time. Gary Player, the winner for the previous two years, was taken to the 39th hole by Gay Brewer in the opening round. Brewer was three up at lunch but Player has leveled the match by the 12th hole of the afternoon. Player then holed an eagle putt from 85 feet at the 17th to take the lead. At the last, Brewer holed from 12 feet for a birdie to level the match again. At the third extra hole, Player noticed that the green staff had moved the hole in preparation for the next day. He objected and the referee, Michael Bonallack, agreed to replace the hole in its original position. With no green staff available a penknife was used to cut out the hole. Brewer's second shot had finished in a green-side bunker but he came out 18 feet past the hole and three-putted to give Player the victory. Player was finally beaten by Peter Thomson in the semi-final. Thomson led by three holes at lunch and led until Player halved the match with an eagle three at the 15th. Thomson birdied the 16th to take the lead again and the match finished when Player hooked his tee shot out of bounds at the 17th. In the final, Thomson was three up over Arnold Palmer after six holes but the match was level when the players went to lunch. The match was still all square after 27 holes. Palmer took the lead with a birdie at the 10th and extended his lead to three holes by winning the 12th and 13th holes. Thomson reduced the lead to one by winning the 14th and 15th but Palmer holed from 15 feet to halve the 16th. The 17th was halved but Thomson was unable to get the birdie he needed at the last. As in previous years, the match play championship was preceded by the Piccadilly Tournament, a 72-hole stroke play competition, which was played on the East Course on 10 and 11 October. The winner was Peter Butler who won £750. Because there were no British golfers in the main event, there had been talk of a boycott of this event by some of the British golfers.
