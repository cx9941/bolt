Abaera nactalis is a species of snout moth in the genus Abaera. It was described by Walker, in 1859, and is the type species of its genus. It is found in Brazil. The larvae feed on Cordia panamensis. They chew one or more escape holes near the blade midvein, then link their fecal pellets using silk to form what look like slender brown stalactites suspended from the underside of the leaf. They live within this loose silk tangle. They are yellow and brown and are well camouflaged within their fecula-sprinkled webbing.	Insect
"Bathynellacea is an order of crustaceans which live interstitially in groundwater. Some species can tolerate low salt concentrations, and at least one African species is a thermophile, living in hot springs and tolerating temperatures up to 55 °C (131 °F). Bathynellaceans are minute, blind, worm-like animals with short, weak legs, reaching a maximum size of 3.4 millimetres (0.13 in). They are found on every continent except Antarctica, although they are missing from some islands, including Fiji, New Caledonia and the Caribbean islands. There are two families, Bathynellidae and Parabathynellidae; a third family, \""Leptobathynellidae\"", is considered a synonym of Parabathynellidae."	Crustacean

Hotel Europe (originally known as Hotel Evropa) is a historic hotel in central Sarajevo. Built and opened in the early days of what turned out to be a 40-year Austro-Hungarian occupation of Bosnia and Herzegovina, the hotel holds a special place in the city's lore as its first modern hospitality venue. Over its almost century and a half long existence, the hotel saw many changes often brought upon by sudden geopolitical events, reflecting the city's turbulent political and social history. For 60 years, from its construction and grand opening until World War II, Hotel Evropa had been owned and run by the Jeftanović family, father and son Gliša and Dušan, respectively, Serb merchants and industrialists from Sarajevo. During the communist period in Yugoslavia from 1945 until 1990, the hotel was nationalized and run by various state-owned entities such as HTP Evropa. Since the Bosnian War, the property has been re-privatized in 2006 by the Sandžak-born Bosniak businessman Rasim Bajrović who re-opened the venue in 2008, this time under a modified name Hotel Europe.

Of the several caves of Aruba, three Aruban caves are well known, seen in deep crevices on the windward face of the island. All three of the caves are located in the Arikok National Park. The most prominent are Guadirikiri Cave, the Fontein Cave and the Huliba Cave. Nocturnal bats nestle in all these caves. The importance which the Government of Aruba attaches to these three caves is borne by the fact that postage stamps with images of them were issued by Post Aruba in April 2009 in specific denominations. The stamp of 175 cents value depicts the Baranca Sunu Cave, the stamp of 200 cents denomination depicts the Fontein Cave, and the stamp of 225 cents value shows the entrance of Quadirikiri Grot (Guadirikiri Cave).

Upon Peter's death, Beatrice had to renounce her claim on Savoy along with the consent of her mother in favor of the succession of her other uncle as Philip I, Count of Savoy, in the article (dated 21 October 1268) she is referred to as Contesson  possibly to distinguish her from her older half-sister of the same name. A charter dated 11 August 1266 by Pope Clement IV presumably tells of Count Philip donating property to his niece \""B\"" most likely referring to Beatrice. Beatrice was firstly betrothed to James, second son of James I of Aragon however, the contract was broken on 11 August 1266. Ten years after the betrothal was broken, James became King of Majorca.

Sholaye-e Inquilab (Persian: شعله انقلاب‎‎, 'Flame of the Revolution') was a Tajik Persian weekly newspaper published from Samarkand, Turkestan Autonomous Soviet Republic between April 1919 and December 1921. The newspaper was founded by Sayyed Reza Alizadeh. The first issue of Sholaye-e Inquilab was published on April 10, 1919. It was the second Tajik Persian newspaper founded (following Bukharai-ye-sharif), and the first Tajik Persian newspaper founded in Soviet Turkestan. The newspaper disseminated the ideological line of the Communist Party of Turkestan. Most of the articles in the newspaper were authored by Alizadeh himself, albeit he used various pen names to conceal the lack of writers. The newspaper called for the creation of a Persian national identity on linguistic lines. Publishing of Sholaye-e Inquilab was discontinued in October 1919. The newspaper had failed to reach 1,000 readers, and the income from its sales did not match the costs of running it. The Samarkand branch of the Communist Party felt unable to continue supporting it economically. In November 1919 the newspaper was re-launched, by the Turkkommissiya based in Tashkent. During this period the newspaper was joined by Sadriddin Ayni and Haji Mu'in, both prominent writers at the time. The issue of Persian national identity was no longer emphasized, instead the new writers would prefer to talk about 'Turkestanis'. It continued to refer to its language as 'Persian' though. The newspaper condemned the regime of the Amir and called for support to the Red Army. Albeit being the sole Persian-language publication in the area, the newspaper continued to fail to gain a wider readership. The newspaper was closed down in December 1921, after its ninetieth issue. Not until August 1924 did a new Tajik newspaper appear (Awaz-e Tajik-e Kambaghal), with Alizadeh, Mu'in and Ayni in its editorial team.	Newspaper

"The 1976 New England Patriots season was the seventh season for the team in the National Football League and 17th season overall. After a nine-year stretch in which they posted just one non-losing season amid eight losing years, the Patriots turned around their fortunes, going 11–3. The team had gone just 3–11 the previous season, and was considered a \""Cinderella team\"" in 1976. Coach Chuck Fairbanks was named NFL Coach of the Year, and cornerback Mike Haynes was named NFL Rookie of the Year. The 1976 Patriots rushed for a total of 2,957 yards (averaging five yards per carry) and scored 376 points, both second-best in the league. The 2,957 yards rushing were the fifth-highest total in NFL history at the time. The team's 5.0 yards per carry was the best in the NFL and remains higher than all Super Bowl champions except the 1973 Miami Dolphins whose own run game was 5.0 yards per carry. The Patriots also led the league in takeways at 50; the Patriots finished third in the league in turnover differential at plus-14. The Patriots made only their second playoff appearance in their history and first since 1963, but lost to the eventual Super Bowl champion Oakland Raiders in the first round of the playoffs. Earlier in the season, the Patriots handed the Raiders their only loss of the season with a final score of 48–17, but a controversial roughing the passer penalty on Ray Hamilton on a Raiders drive late in the playoff game dimmed the Patriots' hopes of defeating the Raiders again. Despite the playoff loss, the team has been considered one of the most talented in Patriots history; in 2004, Patriots head coach Bill Belichick, who was an assistant coach for the Detroit Lions in 1976, called this Patriots team \""loaded\"", a \""who's who team.\"""	NationalFootballLeagueSeason

Quashed (foaled 1932) was a British-bred and British-trained racehorse, winner of the Epsom Oaks in 1935. For many years, the Verdict family was not accepted into the British Stud Book because Quashed's dam was effectively a half-bred and it was not until the 1960s era of the July Cup winner Lucasland that the family's merit persuaded the authorities to review their opinion about its eligibility. But though Quashed may not have been granted a presence in the GSB, she could not be prevented from racing and by the time she retired at the end of 1937 she had won ten races worth £19,096. Chief among these was the Ascot Gold Cup in 1936, when she beat the American horse Omaha by a short head after a tremendous battle. She also won the Epsom Oaks - having started at 33-1 - the Ormonde Stakes and Jockey Club Cup.	RaceHorse

"The Fujian pond turtle (\""Mauremys\"" × iversoni ) is a possibly also naturally occurring intergeneric hybrid turtle in the Geoemydidae family (formerly Bataguridae) produced in larger numbers by Chinese turtle farms as a \""copy\"" of the golden coin turtle Cuora trifasciata. It appears to occur in China and Vietnam. Before its actual origin became known, it was listed as data deficient in the IUCN Red List. The parents of this hybrid are the Asian yellow pond turtle and the golden coin turtle, with the male apparently usually of the latter species. While it is not unusual for perfectly valid geoemydid species to arise from hybridization, recognition as a species would require that the hybrids are fertile and constitute a phenotypically distinct and self-sustaining lineage. This does not appear to be the case in this \""species\"" as only single specimens have been found rather than an entire population of these turtles and captive breeding has rarely been successful as most males proved to be infertile (while females are fully fertile). The Fujian pond turtle's scientific name was given in dedication to American herpetologist John B. Iverson."	Reptile

The Château de Calamane is a castle in the commune of Calamane in the Lot département of France. The castle was built at the end of the 15th century and was sold as a national property in 1796. It is formed of a quadrangular corps de logis flanked, on the north side, by two large cylindrical towers; the tops were removed during the French Revolution. The south side is flanked by a polygonal tower with a spiral staircase. The entrance doorway and the bay which opens above it, are framed with pinnacled pilasters and decorated with cabbages. The castle has suffered much damage and deterioration over the centuries, from the Hundred Years' War to the French Revolution. The ruins were bought in 1862 by the great-great-grandfater of the present owner, who has restored it. Inside are chimney places and a plafond à la française (French-style ceiling: joists the same width as the spaces between them; see Plafond à la française in French Wikipedia). The Château de Calamane is privately owned. It has been listed since 1929 as a monument historique by the French Ministry of Culture.

The 29th New Brunswick general election was held on October 23, 1978, to elect 58 members to the 49th New Brunswick Legislative Assembly, the governing house of the province of New Brunswick, Canada. Richard Hatfield's Progressive Conservative Party narrowly won its third term. In the lead up to 1978, the Opposition Liberal Party seemed destined to return to power. A number of scandals had been tied to the Conservatives and Liberal leader Robert Higgins was widely popular. In early 1978, Higgins believed he had tied some of the scandals directly to Hatfield himself. In a bold move, Higgins promised to resign should Hatfield prove that he was not tied directly to the scandal, which Hatfield promptly did. Higgins was forced to abruptly resign and was replaced by Joseph Daigle as leader. The Liberals mused that Hatfield had purposely ensured false information was leaked to the Liberals to lead them into making false accusations. Higgins' resignation created Hatfield's best chance to go to the polls. He called an election shortly after Daigle became Liberal leader. Despite the lack of a direct link to Hatfield, scandal remained tied to his government and a close election result was assured. Hatfield's government was not entirely clean, however. The Liberals pointed to the Conservatives' budgets, which no longer maintained a surplus. The Bricklin failure was also fresh on voters' minds. While campaigning in anglophone sections of the province, Hatfield accused Daigle of being an anti-monarchist for supporting Pierre Trudeau's constitutional reforms. The result was the closest in New Brunswick history: the governing PCs won 30 seats to 28 for the opposition. The popular vote was very close: 146,719 votes were cast for Conservative candidates, and 146,596 for Liberals. In order to secure a workable majority following the election, Hatfield appointed Liberal Robert McCready as speaker of the legislature, despite strong objections from McCready's Liberal colleagues; McCready went on to seek re-election as a Conservative and served in Hatfield's cabinet. The Parti Acadien had its best ever showing in the election, winning 12% of the vote in the ridings where it fielded candidates, and coming within 200 votes of electing Armand Plourde in Restigouche West.

"Bonanza Creek is a watercourse in Yukon Territory, Canada. It runs for about 20 miles (32 km) from King Solomon's Dome to the Klondike River. In the last years of the 19th century and the early 20th century, Bonanza Creek was the center of the Klondike Gold Rush, which attracted tens of thousands of prospectors to the creek and the area surrounding it. Prior to 1896 the creek was known as Rabbit Creek. Its name was changed by miners in honor of the millions of dollars in gold found in and around the creek. During gold-mining operations, the course of the creek changed drastically. It was heavily developed during the early 20th century, but was largely abandoned by the 1950s. A handful of small gold-mining operations continue on the creek, but today it is best known for its historic value. Two National Historic Sites of Canada have been designated along the creek: \n*  The \""Discovery Claim (Claim 37903)\"", a mining claim on Bonanza Creek where the Klondike Gold Rush began, the discovery of which marked the beginning of the development of the Yukon; and \n*  \""Dredge No. 4\"", a preserved bucketline sluice dredge used to mine placer gold and which symbolizes the importance of dredging operations to the evolution of gold mining in the Klondike."

The 2011 VCU Rams men's soccer team represented Virginia Commonwealth University during the 2011 NCAA Division I men's soccer season. For the Rams, it was the 32nd season fielding a varsity soccer program, and their 17th in the Colonial Athletic Association. The team was led by second year head coach, Dave Giffard, a former assistant for the Akron Zips. Giffard, in his first season, managed the team to second place in the Colonial Athletic Association during the regular season, before losing in the semifinals of the CAA. Despite a better conference and overall record in conference and overall play, the Rams finished in a joint-tie for sixth place in the CAA with Georgia State. The Rams, though, missed the CAA Tournament for the third time in four seasons due to losing the first tiebreaker, which was head-to-head record. Consequently, the Rams were the only men's soccer team in the nation with both a winning conference and overall record to not qualify for their conference tournament. On August 26, the Rams opened up their regular season with a 4–1 home victory against Navy, and they will conclude the regular season on November 4 at Delaware.	SoccerClubSeason

"Thamanya Sayadaw U Vinaya (Burmese: သာမညဆရာတော် ဦးဝိနယ) was a prominent and influential Burmese Buddhist monk of Pa-O descent, best known for his doctrinal emphasis on metta. He was first ordained as a novice at the age of 13 and received higher ordination at the age of 20. He established a monastery and meditation retreat near his hometown, on Thamanya Hill, where he taught meditation and discourses. The area around his monastery was declared a sanctuary (ဘေးမဲ့ဒေသ) where nonviolence and vegetarianism were practiced. By the mid-1980s, followers established a thriving community around Thamanya Hill, comprising 5,000 households in the late 1990s, as the Sayadaw doled out free land tracts around his monastery. In 1991, the Burmese government conferred him the title \""Abhidhaja Agga Maha Saddhamma Jotika\"" for his charity and missionary works. He was known for his education and infrastructure projects, including the construction of the Thanlwin Bridge, a road that connects Myawaddy to Mae Sot and his sponsorship of local schools. However, he publicly criticized the ruling State Law and Order Restoration Council, refused its patronage and invitations to visit Yangon, while he publicly expressed support for Aung San Suu Kyi. He died on 29 November 2003 and had suffered from diabetes and heart problems. On 2 April 2008, his corpse was mysteriously removed from tomb. Four days later, the unknown perpetrators notified monks that the corpse had been burnt, and was found at the site of a small stupa in Kawkada village. This act was widely considered a yadaya ritual."	Religious

Seyval blanc (or Seyve-Villard hybrid number 5276) is a hybrid wine grape variety used to make white wines. Its vines ripen early, are productive and are suited to fairly cool climates.Seyval blanc is grown mainly in England, the United States east coast (specifically the Finger Lakes region of upstate New York, and Virginia), as well as to a lesser extent in Canada. Seyval blanc was created either by Bertille Seyve, or his son-in-law Villard, as a cross of Seibel 5656 and Rayon d'Or (Seibel 4986), and was used to create the hybrid grape St. Pepin. Seyve and Villard used the same Rayon d'Or x Seibel 5656 crossing to produce the red wine grape Seyval noir. As it contains some non-vinifera genes, it is outlawed by the EU authorities for quality wine production, which is an issue of conflict with the English wine industry.	Grape

Nelson Zwinglius Graves (August 10, 1880 – March 31, 1918) was an American cricketer, active in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Graves was one of the Philadelphian cricketers that played from the end of the 19th century through the early years of the next. He was born in Philadelphia and played a total of 34 first-class matches before entering a successful career in manufacturing. Graves began his first-class career for the Gentlemen of Philadelphia on September 14, 1894. This match was played on the Germantown Cricket Club ground against a team of Players of United States of America. Graves scored no runs in the two-day match which ended in a draw. As he was only 14 years old at the time, Graves' poor showing is hardly surprising. Four years later, Graves again played with the Philadelphians, this time against Sir Pelham Warner's touring side. This time he was one of the opening batsmen, though his performance in the loss still left something to be desired. Graves played in several other series against touring English sides while attending the University of Pennsylvania. He then joined the Philadelphian cricket team in England in 1903. It was against Lancashire on July 6 of that year that Graves reached his highest run total. In the first innings at Old Trafford, he made only 19 runs but in the second he helped the Philadelphians to their nine wicket victory with a 103 not out. This score took 105 minutes to achieve and included 9 fours. His second highest first-class score came a month earlier against Nottinghamshire with a 62 not out. His highest recorded scores came during non-first class matches. One came during a match against Scotland on the same tour. This match saw Graves reach a score of 107. In 1898 he hit 128 against Canada. Graves continued his international career during a tour of the Marylebone Cricket Club in the United States. The side played two matches against the Philadelphians in 1905. He also joined the Philadelphian tour of England in 1908. In his last first-class match against Kent County Cricket Club on August 27, Graves only managed 7 runs in the first innings and 4 in the second. After his cricket career came to an end, Graves entered the business world. Earning a great deal of wealth in manufacturing, he purchased the Christian Admiral Hotel in Cape May, New Jersey, although he subsequently declared bankruptcy in 1914. Graves died in Germantown, Pennsylvania on March 31, 1918 at the age of 37.	Cricketer

"MacHomer is a one-person play by Rick Miller which blends William Shakespeare's tragedy Macbeth with the animated television series The Simpsons. Miller first conceived of the idea in 1994, when he was performing in a production of Macbeth. The first performance of MacHomer was at the Montreal Fringe Festival in 1995. MacHomer has been re-written a number of times. The early version of the play was more of a stand-up comedy routine, but in 2000, it was expanded into a theatrical production. In 2006, for the 10th anniversary tour, Miller further revamped the play, adding new songs and characters, and incorporating videos. The script of the play \""remains 85% Shakespeare\"" and mostly follows the plot of Macbeth. Miller performs the various roles using voices from The Simpsons characters, using more than 50 voices. The set includes a video screen at the back of the stage, and sound and video effects are incorporated into the performance. Miller has performed the play in over 150 cities around the world, including performances at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe, the Melbourne International Comedy Festival, and the Just for Laughs comedy festival. MacHomer has received largely positive reviews from critics, with praise going to Miller's impersonations. However, some critics felt that the play seems more like a group of sketches, while others felt that Miller's Homer Simpson voice was one of his weaker impersonations. According to Miller, The Simpsons creator Matt Groening is a fan of the play and gave him permission to perform it."	Play
Stanley Brard (born 24 October 1958 in The Hague) is a retired Dutch footballer who was active as a left back and who is currently head scout at Feyenoord Rotterdam. His cousin Patty is a singer, TV icon and playmate, while his son Joshua is a professional footballer as well. Brard started his career in his town of birth, The Hague where he played for RKSV Lenig en Snel (LENS). He was spotted by scouts of Eredivisie side Feyenoord Rotterdam and joined the youth squads of this team. A few years later, in 1977 he made his debut in the first team of the club in a match against FC Twente. In the following years Brard became a decent fullback and was often in the starting line-up. The best achievements in his career came in the 1983-84 season when Johan Cruyff joined Feyenoord. In that season, at Cruyff's instigation, Brard was moved from the left back position to a position in front of Cruyff, to keep the opposition's right back from making incursions into the Feyenoord half. That year, Feyenoord won both the championship as well as the KNVB Cup. Two years later Brard found himself on the bench more and more. It was time to leave the club. His next mission was at RKC Waalwijk, a club that recently had promoted to the Eerste Divisie and were ambitious to become an Eredivisie side. Brard became a key factor in this team and in the 1987-88 season RKC were the Eerste Divisie champions and promoted to the Eredivisie (to only relegate again in the 2006-07 season). In the Eredivisie Brard was a key player of the team for three more years before he was no longer chosen in the starting line-ups, in his last two seasons of his career he only played seventeen matches. After his career Brard became a manager and joined Vitesse Arnhem where he became a youth coach as well as the coach of the second team for several years. He then switched to ADO Den Haag to become their manager in the 2000-01 and 2001-02 seasons. He also was a technical director at the team. In December 2001 Brard left ADO Den Haag to become a youth coach at Nagoya Grampus Eight in Japan. He remained in this function until February 2005 when Feyenoord contacted him to become a head scout at the team. Brard was Gabala FK's academy director between April 2013 and December 2015, when it was announced he would be joining Japanese side Nagoya Grampus in January 2016.	SoccerManager

The Whyburn, or Town Brook is the main watercourse flowing through the town of Hucknall in the English county of Nottinghamshire. It rises in two separate springs at the foot of the Misk Hills by Whyburn Farm, and flows east into the town of Hucknall, past Whyburn Lane to which it also gives its name. The brook once drove several mills in Hucknall, the most notable example being close to the junction of Baker Street and Annesley Road near the town centre. In the History of Hucknall Torkard it is suggested that a mill pond once existed close to the former village green (now the Market Place). The name of the stream is thought to be derived from a Celtic word 'Wy' meaning 'water'. The Whyburn has a total length of around 2.5 miles (4.0 km), and terminates in a confluence with the River Leen immediately upstream of Bestwood Village Mill Lakes. A school used to take the name of 'Whyburn'.	River

Mount Jefferson is a mountain located just outside Charlottesville, Virginia, United States, in Albemarle County. It lies south of Lewis Mountain, and is positioned at the northeastern edge of the Ragged Mountains. It was named Mount Jefferson in honor of Thomas Jefferson after the establishment of the Leander McCormick Observatory on the summit in 1885. Jefferson had urged the purchase of the mountain for the University of Virginia, in part because of its suitability as a site for an observatory. In addition, he valued it for the water resources and the abundance of timber for construction of the university. Prior to the renaming it had been known as Old Reservoir Mountain and Observatory Mountain (for an observatory which Jefferson directed to be built on the summit), and is now informally known as Observatory Hill.

Wolfiporia dilatohypha is a species of fungus in the order Polyporales. Although it was first described as Poria inflata by Lee Oras Overholts, he neglected to include a Latin description of the species, (then required by the International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants), and so the name was not validly published. Mycologists Leif Ryvarden and Robert Lee Gilbertson published the species validly in 1984 in a revision of Overholts' work. The type collection was made in Oxford, Ohio in 1911.	Fungus

"The discography of German electronic music band Kraftwerk consists of 10 studio albums, one live album, one remix album and 26 singles. Formed by Ralf Hütter and Florian Schneider in Düsseldorf in 1970, Kraftwerk were part of the krautrock scene. However, the group mostly found fame as pioneers of electronic music, showcasing their styles on a series of concept albums. While their initial albums featured mostly German lyrics, in 1975 Kraftwerk began writing lyrics that combined both German and English verses. Beginning with \""Trans-Europe Express\"" (1977), most songs by the group have been created as duplicate versions sung in English or German. Additional versions sung in French, Japanese, Italian or Spanish have also sometimes been made. Since the mid-1970s Kraftwerk have always picked at least two album tracks for release as singles. These accompanying singles were, for many years, created by simply editing down the album recordings, rather than being remixed or otherwise expanded. Since 1991 Kraftwerk have tended to follow the trend for releasing singles in multiple remixed arrangements. Very rarely, a small number of recordings have only been issued as albumless singles, notably recordings for the Expo 2000 project between 1999 and 2000. Prior to forming Kraftwerk, Hütter and Schneider were part of a project called Organisation that released the album Tone Float in 1969."	ArtistDiscography

"In the City of Angels is the fifth solo album by Yes lead singer Jon Anderson, released in 1988. Unlike most of Anderson's previous solo works, this album contains many additional songwriters. Consequently, this is the most straight-ahead commercial pop album in his oeuvre, and sounds closer to a Toto album than his own earlier work—in fact, that band performs on several songs. Jon reciprocated the favor by performing on their album The Seventh One (recorded about the same time as In the City of Angels). Two songs from the album (\""Hold on to Love\"" and \""In a Lifetime\"") were co-written by Lamont Dozier, of Motown records. A music video for \""Hold on to Love\"" aired on TV. In the video, the album is titled In The City of Lost Angels. Chris Squire has a cameo appearance in the video."	Album

The label is most notable for employing the do-it-yourself ethic, producing all of its albums by itself and selling them at discount prices without finance from major distributors. Dischord continues to release records by bands from Washington D.C., and to document and support the Washington D.C. music scene. Dischord was a local label in the early days of hardcore, and is one of the more famous independent labels, along with the likes of Alternative Tentacles, Epitaph Records, SST Records, and Touch & Go Records.

George Caspar Adams attended the Adams Academy before entering Harvard in 1882, where he graduated with an A.B. in 1886. During his time at Harvard, Adams played a vital role in reinstating the football program in 1886 for Harvard by heading a petition movement to the administration. Once the season was granted, Adams played on the team and assisted in managing and coaching it. In 1890, Adams, along with another fellow alumnus, George A. Stewart (Class of 1884) were appointed as coaches for the Harvard football program of the upcoming season. In their first season, the team went 11–0, winning the national championship, also with five players being named All-Americans. The appointment of Adams and Stewart is widely regarded to be the beginning of an organized coaching system at Harvard. He later worked in real estate in Boston. He was also a recreational yachtsman who belonged to many yacht clubs. Adams died of tuberculosis in Quincy 1900.	CollegeCoach
The Ohrid–Debar uprising (Macedonian: Охридско-Дебaрско вoстание, Ohridsko-Debarsko vostanie; Albanian: Kryengritja e Dibër-Ohrit; Serbian: Охридско-дебарски устанак, Ohridsko-Debarski ustanak; Bulgarian: Охридско-Дебърско въстание, Ohridsko-Debarsko vǎstanie) was an uprising in Western Macedonia, then Kingdom of Serbia, in September 1913. It was organized by the Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organization (IMRO) and by local Albanian leaders against the Serbian capture of the regions of Ohrid, Debar and Struga after the Balkan Wars. The rebellion started only two months after the end of the Second Balkan War. The Albanian government organised armed resistance and 6,000 Albanians under the command of Isa Boletini, the Minister of War, crossed the frontier. After an engagement with the Serbians the forces took Debar and then marched, together with a Bulgarian band led by Petar Chaoulev, Milan Matov and Pavel Hristov expelled the Serbian army and officials, creating a front line 15 km east of Ohrid. However, another band was checked with loss at Mavrovo. Within a few days they captured the towns of Gostivar, Struga and Ohrid, expelling the Serbian troops. At Ohrid they set up a local government and held the hills towards Resen for four days. After a fortnight of fierce fighting, a Serbian army of 100,000 regulars suppressed the uprising. Thousands were killed, and tens of thousands of local inhabitants fled for Bulgaria and Albania to save their lives. According to the Report by the International Commission of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace the number of Albanians who took refuge from Macedonia was 25,000; many Bulgarian notables were imprisoned or shot, a number of villages were burned.

The 2000 United States Senate election was held on November 7, 2000. The elections coincided with other federal and state elections, including the United States presidential election of 2000. It featured a number of fiercely contested elections that resulted in a victory for the Democratic Party, which gained a net total of four seats from the Republican Party. This election took place six years after Republicans had won a net gain of eight seats in Senate Class 1 during the elections of 1994. Democrats defeated Republican senators Bill Roth (DE), Spencer Abraham (MI), Rod Grams (MN), John Ashcroft (MO), and Slade Gorton (WA), as well as winning the open seat in Florida. Ashcroft's defeat was noteworthy in that his opponent, Mel Carnahan, had died before the election, but still won. The Republicans did defeat one incumbent, Chuck Robb (VA), and won an open seat in Nevada. The election resulted in an equal 50–50 split between Republicans and Democrats, meaning the Vice President would cast the tie-breaking votes in organizing the Senate. This resulted in the Democrats winning control of the Senate for only 17 days, since Al Gore was still Vice President and President of the Senate at the beginning of the new term, on January 3, 2001. But the Republicans won control of the chamber with the tie-breaking vote of the new Vice President Dick Cheney on January 20. The Republican majority would last until June 6, 2001 when Republican Senator Jim Jeffords of Vermont left the Republican Party, became an independent, and chose to caucus with the Democrats.

"Vuk (Serbian Cyrillic: Вук; 1317–1359) was a Serbian vojvoda (general) that served Emperor Stefan Dušan (r. 1331–55). Vuk was the progenitor of the Kosača family, later influential in the Kingdom of Bosnia in the late 14th- and first half of the 15th century. According to Ragusan chronicler Mavro Orbini (1563–1614), Vuk, also called Hran (Хран), was born in 1317, the son of an unnamed knez (\""count\"", comes) from Rudine. Some historiographical works call Vuk with the family name – Vuk Kosača (Вук Косача). After an incident during a hunt, in which Branko Rastislalić lost his life, Vuk fled first to the Kingdom of Hungary, then joined (or returned to) the court of Emperor Stefan Dušan. Vuk was responsible for Branko's death (some time after 1351) after a conflict arose on the hunting trip of the two families, who both had possessions in Podrinje. Reconciled with the relatives of Branko, Vuk returned to Serbia. Vuk distinguished himself in the military of Emperor Dušan, and was awarded Rudine, a spacious province. According to G. Tomović the possessions were located around Rogatica (now in eastern Bosnia and Herzegovina). A member of the Rastislalić family took revenge by murdering Vuk in Rudine in 1359. Vuk's son, Vlatko (fl. 1388–d. 1392), was a celebrated military commander in the service of Bosnian king Tvrtko I. He also had another son, Hranja, who is known from other sources. The family later amassed power and held what is today Herzegovina."	Noble

The women's épée fencing competition at the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing took place on August 13 at the Olympic Green Convention Centre. The épée competition consisted of a five-round single-elimination bracket with a bronze medal match between the two semifinal losers. Fencing was done to 15 touches or to the completion of three three-minute rounds if neither fencer reached 15 touches by then. At the end of time, the higher-scoring fencer was the winner; a tie resulted in an additional one-minute sudden-death time period. This sudden-death period was further modified by the selection of a draw-winner beforehand; if neither fencer scored a touch during the minute, the predetermined draw-winner won the bout.

Arthur 'Bull' Coghlan (16 August 1902 – 8 June 1959) was an Australian rules footballer who played for and coached Geelong in the VFL. Geelong's Toora recruit was a tough and hard hitting ruckman but could also play in key positions.

The Kangaroos' Fred Rutley was suspended for life for starting the brawl. In 1929 he was appointed captain-coach and in his second season in this role steered Geelong to a Grand Final.

"The first Mexican Liberal Party Convention was held in San Luis Potosí in February 1901. Fifty local clubs from thirteen states sent 56 delegates. The Convention delegates affirmed their liberal beliefs in free speech, free press, and free assembly. They objected to the close workings of the Diaz government and the Catholic Church. The convention produced fifty-one resolutions which called for the organization of the new Liberal Party, propagation of liberal principles, development of means to combat the political influence of the clergy, establishment of means to improve the administration of justice, proposals calling for guarantees of the rights of citizens and real freedom of the press, and proposals favoring complete self-government at the local level. They also called for support for free secular education in the primary schools, the spread of liberal ideas among the lower classes, the establishment of liberal publications, and the taxation of Church income. Ricardo Flores Magón attended the first Convention as a reporter for his newspaper Regeneración (\""Regeneration\""). He afterwards published an editorial in favorable support of the aims and aspirations. In April 1901, the new Mexican Liberal Party opened a branch in Mexico City, and Ricardo Flores Magón and his brothers joined and became active members. Always a bit more radical than most members, Flores Magón was forced into exile in January 1904. Finally settling in San Antonio, Texas, Flores Magón called for radical members of the Liberal Party to follow him in a new organization. In September 1905, the radical liberals, led by Flores Magón, formed a new organization called Junta Organizadora del Partido Liberal Mexicano (PLM). This organization would be separate from the Liberal Party, and it would seek to coordinate the violent overthrow of the Díaz government. The MLP was involved in strikes and uprisings in Mexico from 1906 to 1911."	PoliticalParty

Leucippus (/luːˈsɪpəs/; Greek: Λεύκιππος, Leúkippos; fl. 5th cent. BCE) is reported in some ancient sources to have been a philosopher who was the earliest Greek to develop the theory of atomism—the idea that everything is composed entirely of various imperishable, indivisible elements called atoms. Leucippus often appears as the master to his pupil Democritus, a philosopher also touted as the originator of the atomic theory. However, a brief notice in Diogenes Laertius’s life of Epicurus says that on the testimony of Epicurus, Leucippus never existed. As the philosophical heir of Democritus, Epicurus's word has some weight, and indeed a controversy over this matter raged in German scholarship for many years at the close of the 19th century. Furthermore, in his Corpus Democriteum, Thrasyllus of Alexandria, an astrologer and writer living under the emperor Tiberius (14–37 CE), compiled a list of writings on atomism that he attributed to Democritus to the exclusion of Leucippus. The present consensus among the world's historians of philosophy is that this Leucippus is historical. The matter must remain moot unless more information is forthcoming from the record. Leucippus was most likely born in Miletus, although Abdera and Elea are also mentioned as possible birthplaces.	Philosopher

An annular solar eclipse will occur on October 24, 2079. A solar eclipse occurs when the Moon passes between Earth and the Sun, thereby totally or partly obscuring the image of the Sun for a viewer on Earth. An annular solar eclipse occurs when the Moon's apparent diameter is smaller than the Sun's, blocking most of the Sun's light and causing the Sun to look like an annulus (ring). An annular eclipse appears as a partial eclipse over a region of the Earth thousands of kilometres wide.	SolarEclipse

Hanley Castle High School, formerly known as Hanley Castle Grammar School, was probably founded in 1326, making it one of the oldest schools in England. Located in the village of Hanley Castle, 1.4 miles (2.2 km) from the small town of Upton-upon-Severn, Worcestershire, for much of the 20th century it was a selective boys grammar school that grew from about 50 to around 200 day-pupils and boarders. In 1972, the school opened its doors to girls. In 1974 it became a mixed gender, voluntary controlled comprehensive school and it started to intake pupils at age 14 on transfer from the Hill School in nearby Upton-upon-Severn. The school reverted to being an 11–18 school in the 1990s and the population of students grew over time to around 900 in 2012. In 2011 the school became an academy. The campus comprises 17th century Grade II listed buildings that are still in use alongside those of the major expansions of the late 20th, and early 21st century.The school serves a large, mainly rural area roughly bounded by Malvern to the west, Worcester to the north, and the county of Gloucestershire to the south.

The Party for Freedom (Dutch: Partij voor de Vrijheid, PVV) is a right-wing populist, nationalist political party in the Netherlands. Founded in 2005 as the successor to Geert Wilders' one-man party in the House of Representatives, it won nine seats in the 2006 general election making it the fifth-largest party in parliament. In the 2010 general election it won 24 seats, making it the third-largest party. At that time the PVV agreed to support the minority government led by Prime Minister Mark Rutte without having ministers in the cabinet. However the PVV withdrew its support in April 2012 due to differences over budget cuts at the Catshuis. It came third in the 2014 European Parliament election, winning four out of 26 seats. With program items like administrative detention and strong assimilationist stance on the integration of immigrants into Dutch society, the Party for Freedom breaks from the established centre-right parties in the Netherlands (like the People's Party for Freedom and Democracy, VVD). In addition, the party is consistently Eurosceptic and since early July 2012, according to the program it presented for the elections a few months later in September, it strongly advocates withdrawal from the EU. PVV is the name under which the foundation Stichting Groep Wilders operates. In the beginning it has Geert Wilders as its sole member, making the party unique in the Dutch parliament.	PoliticalParty

Anthelm of Belley (1107–1178) was a prior of the Carthusian Grand Chartreuse and bishop of Belley. He was born near Chambéry in 1107. He would later receive an ecclesiastical benefice in the area of Belley. When he was thirty years old, he resigned from this position to become a Carthusian monk at Portes. Only two years after joining the order, he was made the prior of the Grande Chartreuse, the motherhouse of his order, which had recently incurred substantial damage. He was an effective administrator there. While under his direction, the community increased in numbers and fervency. He restored and improved the buildings, including constructing a defensive wall and an aqueduct. The rules of the order were standardized, and changed to allow women the opportunity to enter the order in their own houses. He also brought the other houses of the order into closer alignment with the motherhouse. The monks under his direction included Hugh of Lincoln, who expressed great fondness for Anthelm. Anthelm continued in his office almost constantly for twenty-four years, barring a period of a few years when he was a hermit. After that period, in 1152, Anthelm returned to the Grand Chartreuse, and helped defend the sitting Pope Alexander III against the antipope Victor IV. Alexander III appointed Anthelm bishop of Belley in 1163. In that position, he is said to have been fearless and uncompromising, working to reform the clergy and regulate the affairs of the diocese. One example of his fearlessness occurred in 1175, when Anthelm excommunicated Count Humbert of Maurienne for having taken one priest captive and murdering another priest who had tried to free him. Humbert appealed his excommunication to Pope Alexander III, who reversed Humbert's excommunication. Anthelm, who believed that Humbert was not penitent for his misconduct, withdrew from his diocese in protest. Pope Alexander then commissioned Anthelm to travel to England to try to reconcile Henry II of England and Thomas Becket. Anthelm's health was such that he was unable to take the journey. Anthelm returned to Belley to help care for the poor and the lepers of the area. Anthelm died at Belley in 1178. On his deathbed, he received Humbert, and recognized that at that time Humbert truly had repented of his earlier acts.	Saint

The United States Navy (USN) is the naval warfare service branch of the United States Armed Forces and one of the seven uniformed services of the United States. The U.S. Navy is the largest, most capable navy in the world, with the highest combined battle fleet tonnage. The U.S. Navy has the world's largest aircraft carrier fleet, with ten in service, two in the reserve fleet, and three new carriers under construction. The service has 328,194 personnel on active duty and 101,199 in the Navy Reserve. It has 272 deployable combat vessels and more than 3,700 aircraft in active service as of February 2016. The U.S. Navy traces its origins to the Continental Navy, which was established during the American Revolutionary War and was effectively disbanded as a separate entity shortly thereafter. It played a major role in the American Civil War by blockading the Confederacy and seizing control of its rivers. It played the central role in the World War II defeat of Imperial Japan. The 21st century U.S. Navy maintains a sizable global presence, deploying in such areas as East Asia, the Mediterranean, and the Middle East. It is a blue-water navy with the ability to project force onto the littoral regions of the world, engage in forward areas during peacetime, and rapidly respond to regional crises, making it an active player in U.S. foreign and defense policy. The Navy is administratively managed by the Department of the Navy, which is headed by the civilian Secretary of the Navy. The Department of the Navy is itself a division of the Department of Defense, which is headed by the Secretary of Defense. The Chief of Naval Operations (CNO) is a four-star admiral and the senior naval officer of the Department of the Navy. However, the CNO may not be the highest ranking naval officer in the armed forces if the Chairman or the Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff are Navy officers, who by law, outrank the CNO.

Titus (Latin: Titus Flāvius Caesar Vespasiānus Augustus; 30 December 39 AD – 13 September 81 AD) was Roman emperor from 79 to 81. A member of the Flavian dynasty, Titus succeeded his father Vespasian upon his death, thus becoming the first Roman Emperor to come to the throne after his own biological father. Prior to becoming Emperor, Titus gained renown as a military commander, serving under his father in Judea during the First Jewish–Roman War. The campaign came to a brief halt with the death of emperor Nero in 68, launching Vespasian's bid for the imperial power during the Year of the Four Emperors. When Vespasian was declared Emperor on 1 July 69, Titus was left in charge of ending the Jewish rebellion. In 70, he besieged and captured Jerusalem, and destroyed the city and the Second Temple. For this achievement Titus was awarded a triumph: the Arch of Titus commemorates his victory to this day. Under the rule of his father, Titus gained notoriety in Rome serving as prefect of the Praetorian Guard, and for carrying on a controversial relationship with the Jewish queen Berenice. Despite concerns over his character, Titus ruled to great acclaim following the death of Vespasian in 79, and was considered a good emperor by Suetonius and other contemporary historians. As emperor, he is best known for completing the Colosseum and for his generosity in relieving the suffering caused by two disasters, the eruption of Mount Vesuvius in AD 79 and a fire in Rome in 80. After barely two years in office, Titus died of a fever on 13 September 81. He was deified by the Roman Senate and succeeded by his younger brother Domitian.	Monarch

Initially the new company only intended to build the section between Mercedes, in Buenos Aires Province, and Villa Mercedes in San Luis Province. From Mercedes the company planned to obtain access to the city of Buenos Aires over the Ferrocarril Oeste track. At Villa Mercedes it connected with the Ferrocarril Andino line that ran on to Mendoza and San Juan.	RailwayLine

Typhoon II (foaled April 17, 1894) was an American thoroughbred racehorse that was bred in Tennessee and was the winner of the 1897 Kentucky Derby. Typhoon won the Derby at 11-5 odds against the favored Ornament on a very muddy track. After his Derby win, Typhoon II was sold to A. Featherstone, owner of Bromley and Company of Chicago, Illinois on August 1, 1897 for $12,000. He followed his Derby win by winning the Club Members' Handicap in St. Louis, Missouri but lost many races after his three-year-old season. The stallion's career declined in his fourth season, when he lost a race at Sheepshead Bay Race Track against only one other competitor. Typhoon II was gelded in 1899 and was thereafter stabled at the Kenmore Farm in Lexington, a farm owned by Bromley and Company, to live the remainder of his life as a pensioner. By 1903, Featherstone ordered his trainer, Julius Bauer, to dispose of Typhoon II, as the horse's paddock was needed for another purpose. Bauer gave the horse to a friend in Lexington, who put him to work as a cart horse hauling hay for livestock.	RaceHorse

Louis Arthur Grimes (1883 – 1948) served as the 10th Chief Justice of Liberia and is considered one of the most important jurists in the history of Liberia. He was appointed Attorney General by President Charles D. B. King and served in this position from 1922 to 1932 when he was appointed Secretary of State by President Edwin Barclay. He served in this position from 1932 to 1933. Secretary Grimes was preceded by Edwin Barclay and replaced by Clarence Lorenzo Simpson. Perhaps Grimes' most significant accomplishment as Secretary of State was his successful defense of Liberia at the League of Nations when it was threatened with loss of its sovereignty as a result of charges that the country was participating in state sanctioned slave trading. In 1933 he was appointed Chief Justice a position he served in until his death in 1948. The Louis Arthur Grimes School of Law at the University of Liberia is named for him. He was a 1905 graduate of Liberia College. Justice Grimes' legacy was continued by his children, including Henry W. Grimes who was a pioneer in telecommunications in Liberia, Joseph Rudolph Grimes, the longest serving Secretary of State in Liberia and a primary author of the charter for the Organization of African Unity (OAU), and Dr. Mary Antoinette Brown-Sherman, the first woman on the African continent to be the President of a major university.

Da'Rel Scott (born May 26, 1988) is an American football running back for the Hamilton Tiger-Cats of the Canadian Football League (CFL). He was selected in the seventh round of the 2011 NFL Draft by the New York Giants. He played college football for the University of Maryland, where he was a starting running back. During the 2008 season, he was the second-leading rusher in the Atlantic Coast Conference, behind Jonathan Dwyer of Georgia Tech. Scott played interscholastic football as a running back and free safety at Plymouth-Whitemarsh High School. He was moderately recruited, but Scout.com thought he was more suited to the position of wide receiver or cornerback at the intercollegiate level. In 2006, he enrolled at the University of Maryland, where he was moved to wide receiver, but he spent the entire season on redshirt status. The following season, he saw limited action as a reserve running back behind starters Lance Ball and Keon Lattimore. He also played on special teams as a kickoff returner, which was the coaching staff's attempt to get him on the field in some capacity because of his speed (4.31 seconds in the 40-yard dash and sub 10.5 seconds in the 100 meters) In 2008, Scott took over as Maryland's starting running back and spent much of the season as the leading rusher in the Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC). He was eventually surpassed by Dwyer, although both players were named to the All-ACC first team at the season's end. Scott also became the 2008 Humanitarian Bowl most valuable player when he broke the University of Maryland bowl game rushing record, and he finished the season with 1,133 rushing yards, the seventh Terrapin player to surpass a thousand yards in a single season.

The Top League is a rugby union competition in Japan. It is the highest level of rugby competition in the country and is an industrial league, where many players are employees of their company and the teams are all owned by major companies. The Japan Rugby Football Union created the competition in 2003, by absorbing the Japan Company Rugby Football Championship, to drive up the overall standard and popularity of the sport and improve the results of the Japan national rugby union team. The first season in 2003–04 featured 12 teams. The league was expanded to 14 teams in 2006–07 and 16 teams in 2013–14. The chief architect of the league was Hiroaki Shukuzawa who strongly felt the urgency of improving Japanese domestic company rugby to a professional level which would allow Japan to compete more convincingly at Rugby World Cups. Many full-time foreign professionals (mainly from Australia and New Zealand) have played in the Top League, notably Tony Brown and George Gregan. In the 2010s, salaries in the Top League have risen to become some of the highest in the rugby world; in 2012, South Africa's Jaque Fourie, now with Kobe Steel Kobelco Steelers, was widely reported to be the world's highest-paid player.

The sooty-capped bush tanager (Chlorospingus pileatus) is a small passerine bird traditionally placed in the family Thraupidae, but now viewed closer to Arremonops in the Emberizidae. This bird is an endemic resident breeder in the highlands of Costa Rica and western Panama. The sooty-capped bush tanager is found in mossy mountain forests, second growth and adjacent bushy clearings, typically from 1600 m altitude to above the timberline. The bulky cup nest is built on bank, in a dense bush, or hidden amongst epiphytes up to 11 m high in a tree. The normal clutch is two pink-brown eggs marked with white. The adult sooty-capped bush tanager is 13.5 cm long and weighs 20g. The adult has a blackish head with a white supercilium and a grey throat. It has olive upperparts and yellow underparts, becoming white on the belly. Some individuals in the Irazu-Turrialba area are greyer and lack yellow in the underparts. Immatures are browner-headed, duller below, and have a duller olive-tinged supercilium. This species is easily distinguished from common bush tanager by its blacker head and obvious supercilium. Sooty-capped bush tanagers occur in small groups, or as part of a mixed-species feeding flock. This species feeds on insects, spiders and small fruits. The sooty-capped bush tanager's call is a high tseet tseet, and the song is a scratchy seechur seechur see see seechur seechur  with variations.	Bird

(For other people with the same name, see John Briggs (disambiguation).) Johnny Briggs (3 October 1862, Sutton-in-Ashfield, Nottinghamshire, England – 11 January 1902, Heald Green, Cheshire, England) was a left arm spin bowler for Lancashire County Cricket Club between 1879 and 1900 who still stands as the second-highest wicket-taker in the county's history after Brian Statham. In the early days of Test cricket, Briggs was one of the most successful bowlers, proving deadly whenever wickets were affected by rain, whilst both for his county and country his batting – though at times too careless – was very useful. He was the first bowler in Test cricket to take 100 wickets, and held the record of most wickets in Test cricket on two occasions, the first in 1895 and again from 1898 until 1904, when he was succeeded by Hugh Trumble. He toured Australia a record six times, a feat only equalled by Colin Cowdrey. Briggs was a notably short man at about five feet five or 165 centimetres. Briggs's skill lay in his ability to vary the flight and pace of the ball as well as in achieving prodigious spin on the primitive pitches of the nineteenth century. As a batsman, Briggs was capable of hitting very effectively, but as time went by an eagerness to punish every ball set in and led to a decline.	Cricketer

He was the only son of Mieszko II Lambert by his wife Richeza, daughter of Count Palatine Ezzo of Lotharingia (of the Ezzonids) and granddaughter of Emperor Otto II.

However, he failed to crown himself King of Poland, mainly because of internal and external threats to his rule.	Monarch

"Phalacrocoracidae is a family of some 40 species of aquatic birds commonly known as cormorants and shags. Several different classifications of the family have been proposed recently, and the number of genera is disputed. There is no consistent distinction between \""cormorants\"" and \""shags\"" as these appellations have been assigned to different species randomly. Cormorants and shags are medium-to-large birds, with body weight in the range of 0.35–5 kilograms (0.77–11.02 lb) and wing span of 45–100 centimetres (18–39 in). The majority of species have dark feathers. The bill is long, thin and hooked. Their feet have webbing between all four toes. All species are fish-eaters, catching the prey by diving from the surface. They are excellent divers, and under water they propel themselves with their feet with help from their wings; some cormorant species have been found to dive as deep as 45 metres. They have relatively short wings due to their need for economical movement underwater, and consequently have the highest flight costs of any bird. Cormorants nest in colonies around the shore, on trees, islets or cliffs. They are coastal rather than oceanic birds, and some have colonised inland waters – indeed, the original ancestor of cormorants seems to have been a fresh-water bird. They range around the world, except for the central Pacific islands."	Bird

In Greek mythology, Leucophrye was the daughter of Mandrolytus, a resident (possibly the ruler) of a city in Asia Minor. Leucippus, son of Xanthius, was chosen by the oracle as leader of a colony of one in ten sent out of Pherae by Admetus (sending out such colonies was a common practice to avoid overpopulation). In search for a new place to settle, he was involved in a military conflict with the native city of Mandrolytus, and besieged it. Leucophrye fell in love with Leucippus and betrayed the city to him. It is not known whether Leucippus answered her feelings and what her further destiny was. Leucophrye's story is similar to those of Comaetho, Scylla (princess) and Pisidice of Methymna, all of which ended tragically for the heroines.	MythologicalFigure

"The Battle of Kara Killisse (Lit. Black church, Turkish: Karakilise Muharebesi) was a battle on the Caucasus front in July 1915 after the Battle of Manzikert. In Russian historical literature, this engagement is considered as a part of \""Alashkert defensive operation\"" (9 July-3 August). Previously in the summer of 1915 the Russians attacked Turkish positions northeast of lake Van but they underestimated the size of their enemy. They were defeated at the Battle of Manzikert. This success encouraged the Turks under Abdul Kerim Pasha to advance towards the Russians in the Eleşkirt valley while the Turks were pursuing the remnants of Oganovki's army across the Ağrı mountains they spread out and Russian general Yudenich took the opportunity to counterattack from the west with some 20.000 reinforcements mostly Cossack units to encircle them. in the following battles between 5–8 August the Turks retreated south but the Russians succeeded only partially. The Turks lost some guns, large provisions and 10.000 killed and wounded and 6.000 became prisoners. Due to difficulties the Russians could not gain total advantage and retreated from the town of Van and Turks occupied it on 3 August."	MilitaryConflict
Schoolroom Glacier is a small glacier in Grand Teton National Park in the U.S. state of Wyoming. This Teton Range glacier lies adjacent to the south Cascade Canyon trail at an altitude of 10,400 ft (3,200 m), approximately 12 mi (19 km) from the trailhead at Jenny Lake. The glacier has many of the classic textbook details of a glacier, namely, well defined terminal and lateral moraines, crevasses, a proglacial lake and related features which led to the naming schoolroom. As is true for a vast majority of glaciers worldwide, Schoolroom Glacier has been in a state of retreat for many decades, and if current climatic conditions persist, the glacier is anticipated to disappear by the year 2030, if not sooner.

"The Preakness Stakes is an American flat thoroughbred horse race held on the third Saturday in May each year at Pimlico Race Course in Baltimore, Maryland. It is a Grade I race run over a distance of 9.5 furlongs (1 3⁄16 miles (1,900 m)) on dirt. Colts and geldings carry 126 pounds (57 kg); fillies 121 lb (55 kg). It is the second jewel of the Triple Crown, held two weeks after the Kentucky Derby and three weeks before the Belmont Stakes. First run in 1873, the Preakness Stakes was named by a former Maryland governor after a winning colt at Pimlico. The race has been termed \""The Run for the Black-Eyed Susans\"" because a blanket of yellow flowers altered to resemble Maryland's state flower is placed around the winner's neck. Attendance at the Preakness Stakes ranks second in North America among equestrian events, only surpassed by the Kentucky Derby."	HorseRace

The 2004 All-Ireland Senior Club Hurling Championship final was a hurling match played at Croke Park on 17 March 2004 to determine the winners of the 2003–04 All-Ireland Senior Club Hurling Championship, the 34th season of the All-Ireland Senior Club Hurling Championship, a tournament organised by the Gaelic Athletic Association for the champion clubs of the four provinces of Ireland. The final was contested by Dunloy of Antrim and Newtownshandrum of Cork, with Newtownshandrum winning by 0-17 to 1-6. Dunloy started quickly and opened the scoring through Colin McGuickian, however, that was the only time they were to lead during the match. Ben O'Connor levelled the scores from a free before Alan T. O'Brien completed a fine solo run by landing a point. Dunloy hit three wides, while at the other end Ben O'Connor tapped over another free to increase his side's lead. O'Connor put on a show of deadly accuracy from placed balls throughout the half. He put over three frees – the last of which could have so easily been a goal as he blasted it in low forcing goalkeeper Gareth McGee to deflect it over for a point. Dunloy started the second half under pressure. When Martin Curry was fouled in the area for a penalty, goalkeeper McGee stepped up to blast the sliotar into the back of the net and give his side a boost. The Antrim side then closed the gap between the two sides even further after Ben O'Connor missed a straightforward free while at the other end Paddy Richmond slotted over another point for the Northerners to reduce the deficit to two points. The match was as close as Dunloy were to come as Ben O'Connor, Andy O'Brien and James Bowles all found their range to put Newtown six points ahead before Jerry O'Connor claimed the score of the afternoon as he burst through on a fine solo run. Ben O'Connor increased his personal tally to ten points, while Alan T. O'Brien put the icing on the cake, and his third of the game was to be the final point. Newtownshandrum's victory secured their first and only All-Ireland title. They become the 21st club to win the All-Ireland title, while they are the fifth Cork representatives to claim the ultimate prize. Dunloy's All-Ireland defeat was their second in succession and their fourth over all. Due to the similarity of the colour of their jerseys a change was necessary. Each team donned a version of their county jersey, with Newtownshandrum wearing a red and white strip and Dunloy wearing a saffron and white strip.	FootballMatch

2227 Otto Struve, provisional designation 1955 RX, is an asteroid from the inner regions of the asteroid belt, roughly 9 kilometers in diameter. It was discovered on 13 September 1955, by the Indiana Asteroid Program at Goethe Link Observatory near Brooklyn, Indiana, United States. The asteroid orbits the Sun at a distance of 1.8–2.6 AU once every 3 years and 4 months (1,221 days). Its orbit is tilted by 5 degrees to the plane of the ecliptic and shows an eccentricity of 0.17. Little is known about the asteroids exact size, composition, albedo and rotation period, despite having a well-observed orbit with the lowest possible uncertainty – a condition code of 0 – and an observation arc that spans over a period of more than 80 years. Based on its absolute magnitude of 13.4, its diameter could be anywhere between 5 and 13 kilometers, assuming an albedo in the range of 0.05 to 0.25. Since most asteroids in the outer main-belt are of a carbonaceous rather than of a silicaceous composition, with low albedos, typically around 0.05, the asteroid's diameter might be on the upper end of NASA's published conversion table, as the lower the reflectivity (albedo), the larger the body's diameter for a given intrinsic brightness (absolute magnitude). The minor planet is named in memory of astronomer Otto Struve (1897–1963), discoverer of the two asteroids 991 McDonalda and 992 Swasey, and last of a remarkable dynasty of astronomers: the Struve family. His greatgrandfather, Wilhelm Struve (also see 768 Struveana), founded the Pulkovo Observatory near St. Petersburg in 1839; his grandfather (Otto), uncle (Hermann) and father (Ludwig) were also distinguished astronomers. Following a period of great privation and misery after World War I, he was invited by Edwin B. Frost (also see 854 Frostia) to come to the U.S. Yerkes Observatory in 1921. He started working in spectroscopy and remained a spectroscopist to the end of his days. He succeeded Frost as Yerkes director in 1932 and was the major force responsible for the establishment of the Texan McDonald Observatory in 1933. Managing editor of the Astrophysical Journal from 1932 to 1947 and became head of the astronomy department of the University of California in Berkeley in 1950.	Planet

Mark Lyndon Tonelli (born 13 April 1957), whose birth name was Mark Lyndon Leembruggen, is an Australian former backstroke, butterfly, and freestyle swimmer of the 1970s and 1980s, who won a gold in the 4×100-metre medley relay at the 1980 Moscow Olympics as a makeshift butterfly swimmer in the self-named Quietly Confident Quartet. Tonelli unofficially led the relay team and was an athletes' spokesperson who fought for the right of Australian Olympians to compete in the face of a government call for a boycott to protest against the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan. Tonelli took up swimming due to his asthma, and quickly came to prominence. Selected to represent Australia at the 1973 World Championships, he came sixth in the 200 m backstroke at the age of 16. He won his first Australian titles in 1974 in the 100 m backstroke and 200 m butterfly and went on to the 1974 Commonwealth Games in Christchurch, where he won his first major international race, the 100 m backstroke, and took silver in the 200 m backstroke. In 1975, Tonelli won his only individual medal at global level, a silver in the 200 m backstroke at the World Championships in Cali, Colombia. In 1975, Tonelli enrolled at the University of Alabama in the United States, studying and competing in the collegiate sport system. He was selected in both backstroke events for the 1976 Summer Olympics in Montreal, but struggled and missed the medals in both events. During his stay in America, Tonelli set times that would have placed him among the world's leading swimmers, but he was expelled from the 1978 Commonwealth Games team for breaches of discipline. After finishing his American university career, Tonelli returned to Australia and gained selection for his second Olympics. Having cleared the political obstacles, Tonelli was given a heavy schedule of six events: both backstroke races, the 100 m freestyle and butterfly, and two relays. He made little impact in the individual events, only reaching one final. Australia lacked butterfly swimmers and Tonelli was versatile, so he swum the stroke in the medley relay. He performed above his previous record, posting a time fast enough to win silver in the corresponding individual event and helping Australia to an unexpected win. Upon returning to Australia, Tonelli retired with eleven individual Australian championships in three different strokes.	Swimmer

When that season finished, Ron Wilson, Teesside's promoter, took Maclean to Milton Keynes, a new track. The end of 1979 saw a swap deal agreed, with Maclean going to Edinburgh Monarchs and Bert Harkins going to Milton Keynes Knights. Maclean retired from speedway in 1983.

The Siege of Nicaea of 727 was an unsuccessful attempt by the Umayyad Caliphate to capture the Byzantine city of Nicaea, the capital of the Opsician Theme. Ever since its failure to capture the Byzantine Empire's capital, Constantinople, in 717–718, the Caliphate had launched a series of raids into Byzantine Asia Minor. In 727, the Arab army, led by one of the Caliph's sons, penetrated deep into Asia Minor, sacked two Byzantine fortresses and in late July arrived before Nicaea. Despite constant attacks for 40 days, the city held firm and the Arabs withdrew and returned to the Caliphate. The successful repulsion of the attack was a major boost for Byzantine emperor Leo III the Isaurian's recently initiated campaign to abolish the veneration of icons in the Empire; Leo claimed it as evidence of divine favour for his policy. The siege of Nicaea marks also the high point of the Umayyad raids, as new threats and defeats on their far-flung frontiers diverted Umayyad strength elsewhere, while Byzantine power gradually recovered.

"Alcestis (/ælˈsɛstɪs/; Greek: Ἄλκηστις, Alkēstis) is an Athenian tragedy by the ancient Greek playwright Euripides. It was first produced at the City Dionysia festival in 438 BCE. Euripides presented it as the final part of a tetralogy of unconnected plays in the competition of tragedies, for which he won second prize; this arrangement was exceptional, as the fourth part was normally a satyr play. Its ambiguous, tragicomic tone—which may be \""cheerfully romantic\"" or \""bitterly ironic\""—has earned it the label of a \""problem play.\"" Alcestis is, possibly excepting the Rhesus, the oldest surviving work by Euripides, although at the time of its first performance he had been producing plays for 17 years."

WFHW-LP was a low-powered community-oriented television station licensed to Buffalo, New York, founded by consumer rights advocate Ralph Nader in late 1988 as W58AV on UHF 58. The station broadcast from the top of the Marine Midland Bank Tower (now One HSBC Center) in downtown Buffalo, with an initial power of 100 watts (later upgraded to 1000, and finally, 15,100 watts). From the beginning, the station aired a large amount of locally produced fare, with programming from Channel America, as well as a partnership with The Learning Channel.

Administratively, the Petite Terre Islands are dependent of the commune (municipality) of La Désirade. The two islands and 842 hectares (2,081 acres) of sea around them were declared a nature reserve, the National Nature Reserve of Îles de la Petite-Terre."	Lighthouse

The Knights (Ancient Greek: Ἱππεῖς Hippeîs; Attic: Ἱππῆς) was the fourth play written by Aristophanes, the master of an ancient form of drama known as Old Comedy. The play is a satire on the social and political life of classical Athens during the Peloponnesian War and in this respect it is typical of all the dramatist's early plays. It is unique however in the relatively small number of its characters and this was due to its scurrilous preoccupation with one man, the pro-war populist Cleon. Cleon had prosecuted Aristophanes for slandering the polis with an earlier play, The Babylonians (426 BC), for which the young dramatist had promised revenge in The Acharnians (425 BC), and it was in The Knights (424 BC) that his revenge was exacted. The Knights won first prize at the Lenaia festival when it was produced in 424 BC.	Play
"The Honourable Artillery Company (HAC) was incorporated by Royal Charter in 1537 by King Henry VIII and is considered one of the oldest military organisations in the world. Today it is a registered charity whose purpose is to attend to the \""better defence of the realm\"", this purpose is primarily achieved by the support of the HAC Regiment and a detachment of Special Constabulary to the City of London Police. The word \""artillery\"" in \""Honourable Artillery Company\"" does not have the current meaning that is generally associated with it, but dates from a time when in the English language that word meant any projectile, including for example arrows shot from a bow. The equivalent form of words in modern English would be either \""Honourable Infantry Company\"" or \""Honourable Military Company.\"" In the 17th century its members played a significant part in the formation of both the Royal Marines and the Grenadier Guards whilst more recently regiments, battalions and batteries of the Company fought with distinction in both World Wars and its current Regiment, which forms part of the Army Reserve, is the oldest surviving regiment in the British Army, and the second most senior in the Army Reserve. Members of the Regiment and Specials are drawn, for the most part, from young men and women working in and around the City and Greater London.

"Jackie was a weekly British magazine for girls. The magazine was published by D. C. Thomson & Co. Ltd of Dundee from 11 January 1964 until its closure on 3 July 1993—a total of 1534 issues. The name was chosen from a list of girls' names, although it was nearly dropped due to the association with Jackie Kennedy following her husband's assassination in 1963. An urban legend exists that it was named after Jacqueline Wilson who worked there at the time, before she became a notable children's author. Although the author has attempted to perpetuate this claim, this has been denied by those who were involved in the launch. Ex-RAF Engine Fitter Gordon Small was the first editor. TV critic Nina Myskow was a former editor. Jackie was the best-selling teen magazine in Britain for ten years, with sales rising from an initial 350,000 to 605,947 in 1976. The best ever selling issue was the 1972 special edition to coincide with the UK tour of American singer David Cassidy. During the 1970s, \""Jackie\"" published a mix of fashion and beauty tips, gossip, short stories and comic strips. The latter were usually illustrated with line drawings or posed photographs, especially if the story involved a \""reader's true life experience\"". Both the comics and the short stories invariably dealt with either romance or family issues. The centre pages of the magazine usually contained a pull-out poster of a popular band or film star. Jackie became very popular with young teenage girls, not least because of the \""Cathy and Claire\"" problem page, which received 400 reader letters a week and dealt with controversial issues that were nonetheless relevant to the readership. However, the subjects covered in the column were not reflective of the majority of readers' letters, which focused on sex-related issues—DC Thomson as a result kept the editorial brief, but created a series of help leaflets which they sent to letter writers. In 1974 the NHS made the contraceptive pill free on prescription, and so under editor Myskow the magazine introduced a \""Dear Doctor\"" column, which covered what were termed as \""below the waist issues\"". Sales declined after the 1970s, and by 1993 circulation had dropped to 50,000 weekly. Deciding not to follow the more sexuality and high-fashion orientation of newer teenage magazines, DC Thomson chose to shut the magazine down. It was one of several Thomson papers to close that year. More recently, the company has started issuing every year a historic Jackie annual. BBC Radio invited Jackie Clune to do an epitaph for Jackie and, in 2007, the BBC produced an hour long programme devoted to the magazine's 1970s heyday, called Jackie Magazine: A Girl's Best Friend, with contributions from former readers, writers, staff and publishers. The magazine also inspired a musical."	Magazine

The Steller's jay (Cyanocitta stelleri) is a jay native to western North America, closely related to the blue jay found in the rest of the continent, but with a black head and upper body. It is also known as the long-crested jay, mountain jay, and pine jay. It is the only crested jay west of the Rocky Mountains. While it does not have as prominent a crest the Blue Jay (Cyanocitta cristata) can be found west of the Rockies especially in south east British Columbia. The Steller's jay shows a great deal of regional variation throughout its range. Blackish-brown-headed birds from the north gradually become bluer-headed farther south. The Steller's jay has a more slender bill and longer legs than the blue jay and has a much more pronounced crest. It is also somewhat larger. The head is blackish-brown with light blue streaks on the forehead. This dark coloring gives way from the shoulders and lower breast to silvery blue. The primaries and tail are a rich blue with darker barring. It occurs in coniferous forest over much of the western half of North America from Alaska in the north to northern Nicaragua completely replacing the blue jay in most of those areas. Some hybridization with the blue jay in Colorado has been reported. The Steller's jay lives in coniferous and mixed woodland, but not in completely dense forest, and requires open space. It typically lives in flocks of greater than 10 individuals. In autumn, flocks often visit oak woods when acorns are ripe.	Bird
"The baboon spider Pterinochilus murinus, an old-world tarantula, was first described in 1897 by Reginald Innes Pocock. This species is found on the African continent, in Angola, as well as central, eastern, and southern Africa. Among those who keep tarantulas as pets Pterinochilus murinus is known as \""OBT,\"" which means \""orange baboon tarantula\"" or \""orange bitey thing\"" and also as the \""pterror,\"" a pun on its Latin genus classification: Pterinochilus. These nicknames reference a particular orange colour form that is prized in the hobby for its beauty and confrontational personality. It is also known as the Mombasa golden starburst tarantula. This species is incredibly defensive and, as with most tarantulas, should not be held. The bite of this species, while not serious, is extremely painful. Moreover, the species is more than willing to inflict such a bite before presenting the typical threat display. Caution when dealing with this species is advised."	Arachnid

"The Zenkunen War (前九年の役 Zenkunen no Eki), also known in English as the Former Nine Years' War or the Early Nine Years' War, was fought from 1051 to 1063, in Japan's Mutsu Province, at the far north of the main island of Honshū. Like the other major conflicts of the Heian period, such as the Gosannen War and the Genpei War, the Zenkunen war was a struggle for power within the samurai clans. While most provinces were overseen by just a Governor, Mutsu, in what is now the Tohoku region, had a military general in charge of controlling the Emishi natives, who had been subjugated when the Japanese took over the area in the ninth century. Historically, this post was always held by a member of the Abe clan, and there were many conflicts between the Abe general and the Governor over administrative control of the province. In 1050, the general overseeing the Ainu was Abe no Yoritoki, who levied taxes and confiscated property on his own, rarely paying any heed to the wishes of the province's Governor. The Governor sent word to the capital in Kyoto asking for help, and as a result Minamoto no Yoriyoshi was appointed both Governor and commander-in-chief over controlling the natives. He was sent with his son Yoshiie, then age fifteen, to stop Abe. The fighting lasted for twelve years, or nine if one subtracts short periods of ceasefire and peace. Skirmishes were fierce and many, but few major battles were fought until the battle of Kawasaki in 1057. Abe no Yoritoki had been killed shortly before, and the Minamoto were now fighting his son, Abe no Sadato, who defeated them at Kawasaki and pursued them through a blizzard. The government forces, led by the Minamoto, had much trouble for quite some time, due to the harsh terrain and weather, but were eventually reinforced with new troops, including many offered by the Governor, a member of the Kiyohara clan, of the nearby Dewa province. In 1062, Minamoto no Yoriyoshi, along with his son, led an assault on an Abe fortress at Siege of Kuriyagawa. They diverted the water supply, stormed the earthworks and stockade, and set the fortress aflame. After two days of fighting, Sadato surrendered. Minamoto no Yoshiie is thus considered the founder of the Minamoto clan's great martial legacy, and is worshiped as a particularly special and powerful ancestor kami of the clan. As a kami and a legend, he is often called Hachimantarō, \""Child of Hachiman, the god of war.\"" A famous renga from the Kokon Chomonjū was exchanged between Sadato and Yoshiie when Sadato was forced to flee his castle on the Koromo River. Yoshiie said, Koromo no tate wa hokorobinikeri, Koromo Castle has been destroyed (\""The warps of your robe have come undone\""), to which Sadato replied, toshi o heshi ito no midare no kurushisa ni, \""over the years its threads became tangled, and this pains me.\"""	MilitaryConflict

"Two-stage presidential elections were held in Finland in 1925. On 15 and 16 January the public elected presidential electors to an electoral college. They in turn elected the President. The result was a victory for Lauri Kristian Relander, who won on the third ballot. The turnout for the popular vote was just 39.7%.The outgoing President, K.J. Ståhlberg, had refused to seek a second term. According to the late Agrarian and Centrist politician, Johannes Virolainen, he stepped down after one term because he believed that an incumbent President would be too likely to win re-election. President Ståhlberg claimed that he had already completed his political service to Finland as President. Moreover, he wanted to step down because many right-wing Finns (especially veterans of the Civil War and supporters of the Greater Finland movement) opposed him. According to Pentti Virrankoski, a Finnish historian, President Ståhlberg hoped that his retirement would advance parliamentary politics in Finland. Ståhlberg's party, the Progressives, chose Risto Ryti, the Governor of the Bank of Finland, as their presidential candidate. The Agrarians only chose Lauri Kristian Relander as their presidential candidate in early February 1925. The National Coalitioners originally chose former Regent and Prime Minister Pehr Evind Svinhufvud as their presidential candidate, but before the presidential electors met, they replaced Svinhufvud with Hugo Suolahti, an academician working as the Rector (Principal) of the University of Helsinki (Heikinheimo, Ilmari, Suomen elämäkerrasto (The Biography Compilation of Finland), pg. 731, Helsinki: Werner Söderström Publications Ltd., 1955). Relander surprised many politicians by defeating Ryti as a dark-horse presidential candidate, although he had served as the Speaker of the Finnish Parliament, and as Governor of the Province of Viipuri. Ståhlberg had quietly favoured Ryti as his successor, because he considered Ryti a principled and unselfish politician. He was disappointed with Relander's victory, and told one of his daughters that if he had known beforehand that Relander would be elected as his successor, he would have considered seeking a second term (see, for example, Sakari Virkkunen, Finland's Presidents I / Suomen presidentit I.

Seminole Tribe of Florida v. Florida, 517 U.S. 44 (1996), was a United States Supreme Court case which held that Article One of the U.S. Constitution did not give the United States Congress the power to abrogate the sovereign immunity of the states that is further protected under the Eleventh Amendment. Such abrogation is permitted where it is necessary to enforce the rights of citizens guaranteed under the Fourteenth Amendment as per Fitzpatrick v. Bitzer 427 U.S. 445 (1976). The case also held that the doctrine of Ex parte Young, 209 U.S. 123 (1908), which allows state officials to be sued in their official capacity for prospective injunctive relief, was inapplicable under these circumstances, because any remedy was limited to the one that Congress had provided.

"Urbacodon (\""URBAC tooth\"") is a genus of troodontid dinosaur, a type of small carnivore. It lived in Uzbekistan during the early Late Cretaceous Period, about 95 million years ago. On 9 September 2004, a lower jaw of a small theropod was uncovered by Anton Sergeevich Rezwiy near Itemir in the IT-01 quarry. The type species, Urbacodon itemirensis, was named by Alexandr Averianov and Hans-Dieter Sues in 2007. The first part of the generic name Urbacodon is an acronym, honouring the Uzbek, Russian, British, American and Canadian scientists who participated in its discovery. This acronym was combined with a Greek ὀδών, odon, \""tooth\"". The specific name refers to the provenance from Itemir. The name was based on the holotype ZIN PH 944/16, a single left dentary with preserved replacement teeth from the Cenomanian Dzharakuduk Formation. Averianov and Sues also identified teeth and other material, earlier described by Lev Nesov, as a Urbacodon sp. from the nearby Turonian Bissekty Formation. The holotype dentary of U. itemirensis is 79.2 millimetres long (3.12 in) and has 32 tooth positions. It is rather straight in top view. The teeth are closely packed but between the front twenty-four teeth and the rear eight teeth, a distinctive gap is present, a diastema. This is a unique trait but was not formally designated as an autapomorphy because it might be the result of individual variation. Urbacodon resembles Byronosaurus and Mei but differs from most other Troodontidae in that its teeth lack serrations. Urbacodon is distinguished from Byronosaurus by a less vascularized lateral dentary groove and more bulbous anterior tooth crowns, and from Mei by considerably larger size. Averianov and Sues viewed Urbacodon as more plesiomorphic than Troodon and Saurornithoides in having a straight dentary with fewer teeth, but did not attempt to place it on a cladogram. In 2010, a cladistic analysis showed it as a close relative of Byronosauris and Xixiasaurus."	Reptile

A few players from the relegated FCM Bacău, were signed, with also a few foreign players. The new coach was Gheorghe Mulţescu. The team started very bad, and it seemed the previous season, will repeat. However, after a 1-1 draw with Poli Iasi, Mulţescu was sacked and the new coach was named Viorel Hizo.

"The shore clingfish, Lepadogaster lepadogaster, is a clingfish of the family Gobiesocidae, found in the eastern Atlantic from Ireland and Britain, where it is more commonly known as the Cornish lumpsucker, and in the Mediterranean, between latitudes 46° N and 30° N. L. lepadogaster often inhabits underwater boulder fields consisting of smooth rocks and large pebbles.  Its length is up to 65 mm. L. lepadogaster is also classified as a cryptobenthic fish. Cryptobenthic simply means that the fish is both behaviorally and visually cryptic. The term is also used mainly to describe adult fish of a certain size, roughly around 5cm in length. The clingfish gets its name from the ability of the fish to attach itself to the rock walls of the ocean shore. It does this by having pelvic fins that have been adapted to form suckers. These suckers keep the clingfish strongly attached to the rocky surfaces off the shorelines. In addition to these suckers, the front fins of the clingfish are much stronger to aid in clinging to the rocks. The clingfish has other adaptations that allow it to inhabit rocky surfaces and reduce predation. For instance, the clingfish has a triangular shaped head and a flattened body. These characteristics allow the clingfish to reduce the drag of the water from the waves pushing and pulling against it. L. lepadogaster also has distinct differences from the other species of Lepadogaster. For one, L. lepadogaster has a much more active lifestyle than the species \""L. purpurea. This is evident in both L. lepadogaster's swimming speed and in its more frequent feeding periods The cornish lumpsucker survives by consisting on a diet of mostly detritus material, meaning that it lives off the dead organic matter of its environment."

DDO 190 (or UGC 9240) is a dwarf irregular galaxy in the vicinity of the Milky Way, as it is relatively small and lacks clear structure. It is 9.10 million light-years (2.79 Mpc) away from us and lies out of the Local Group, determined by the tip of the red giant branch method. The outskirts of the galaxy are harbouring older (reddish) stars, while the centre is crowded with younger (bluish) stars. Heated gas is observed at several places. DDO 190 still experiences some active star formation. The galaxy is categorised as a Magellanic dwarf galaxy of morphological type Im. Its metallicity is [Fe/H] = −1.55 ± 0.12. DDO 190 is small, but not tiny: about 15,000 light years across—about 1/6 the size of our galaxy. It is also well outside the Local Group, which contains nearby galaxies (the Andromeda galaxy is less than 3 million light years distant from Earth, for comparison), and is instead thought to be part of the M94 galaxy group. But if true it is fairly isolated even from the others on its team; the nearest neighbor appears to be another dwarf galaxy, DDO 187, at a distance of 3 million light-years (0.92 Mpc).	Galaxy

"Pierre-Joseph Proudhon (French: [pjɛʁ ʒɔzɛf pʁudɔ̃]; 15 January 1809 – 19 January 1865) was a French politician and the founder of mutualist philosophy. He was the first person to declare himself an anarchist and is widely regarded as one of the ideology's most influential theorists. Proudhon is even considered by many to be the \""father of anarchism\"". He became a member of the French Parliament after the revolution of 1848, whereafter he referred to himself as a federalist. Proudhon, who was born in Besançon, was a printer who taught himself Latin in order to better print books in the language. His best-known assertion is that Property is Theft!, contained in his first major work, What is Property? Or, an Inquiry into the Principle of Right and Government (Qu'est-ce que la propriété? Recherche sur le principe du droit et du gouvernement), published in 1840. The book's publication attracted the attention of the French authorities. It also attracted the scrutiny of Karl Marx, who started a correspondence with its author. The two influenced each other: they met in Paris while Marx was exiled there. Their friendship finally ended when Marx responded to Proudhon's The System of Economic Contradictions, or The Philosophy of Poverty with the provocatively titled The Poverty of Philosophy. The dispute became one of the sources of the split between the anarchist and Marxist wings of the International Working Men's Association. Some, such as Edmund Wilson, have contended that Marx's attack on Proudhon had its origin in the latter's defense of Karl Grün, whom Marx bitterly disliked, but who had been preparing translations of Proudhon's work. Proudhon favored workers' associations or co-operatives, as well as individual worker/peasant possession, over private ownership or the nationalization of land and workplaces. He considered social revolution to be achievable in a peaceful manner. In The Confessions of a Revolutionary Proudhon asserted that, Anarchy is Order Without Power, the phrase which much later inspired, in the view of some, the anarchist circled-A symbol, today \""one of the most common graffiti on the urban landscape.\"" He unsuccessfully tried to create a national bank, to be funded by what became an abortive attempt at an income tax on capitalists and shareholders.

The alleged finding of human remains, designated San Geronimo, in 1853 afforded striking confirmation of an incident recorded by a Spanish Benedictine named Diego de Haedo, who published a topography and history of Algiers in 1612. Haedo sets forth the legend that a young Arab who had embraced Christianity, and had been baptized with the name of Geronimo, had been captured by a Moorish corsair in 1569 and taken to Algiers. The Arabs endeavoured to induce Geronimo to renounce Christianity, but as he steadfastly refused to do so, he was condemned to death. Bound hand and foot, he was thrown alive into a mould in which a block of concrete was about to be made. The block containing his body was built into an angle of the Fort of the Twenty-four Hours, then under construction. According to Samuel M. Zwemer (see link below), in 1853 the Fort of the Twenty-four Hours was demolished, and in the very angle specified by Haedo the skeleton of Geronimo was found. The bones were interred at St. Philippe. Liquid plaster of Paris was run into the mould left by the saint's body, creating a perfect model showing the features of the youth, the cords which bound him, and even the texture of his clothing. This model was said to be held in the museum formerly at Parc du Galland, Mustapha Superior, Algiers.	Saint

Edward Mann was a London-based hatmaker and milliner popular in the second half of the 20th century. While Mann was working as a milliner in the 1950s, he became particularly known for his creative 1960s designs, such as designs with incorporated pockets and lace baby-bonnet-style caps. In 1967 he produced a collection inspired by the Common Market, which was shown in Germany as well as in London, and presented on models from across Europe. He was also the designer of the hats worn by Diana Rigg as Emma Peel in the 1960s TV series The Avengers. This led to Mann becoming, briefly, one of the most desirable milliners in London at that time. In 1967, one of Mann's hats was chosen by Felicity Green of The Daily Mirror as part of her Dress of the Year selection for the Fashion Museum, Bath. The hat was made to match an orange and pink striped trouser suit by David Bond for Slimma. In the mid-1970s Edward Mann owned a clothing brand called Buckle Under. By 1982, the Edward Mann company operated as a concessionary brand, selling its hats through eighteen department stores and other retailers, rather than having their own shops.	FashionDesigner
"Colin Haughton (born 12 November 1972) is an English badminton singles player from Denton near Manchester who held the No. 1 position in the national rankings and reached as high as 19th in the world rankings. Colin Haughton reached final of the English National Championships for five consecutive years, from 2000 to 2004. He won in 2000, 2001 and 2003, and did not contest the 2002 final, pulling out with injury, to give Mark Constable his only national title, with a walkover. Haughton lost the 2004 title to rising star Aamir Ghaffir, in front of his home crowd in Manchester, in a disappointing final. Shortly afterwards Haughton announced his retirement; it seems he had been suffering from a niggling hip injury, which had affected his performance in the final. On Friday 2 February 2001, at the English Nationals in Burgess Hill, Colin achieved the dubious distinction of being the first English player to be ‘yellow carded’ by the umpire. His unfortunate offence was to have left his mobile telephone in his bag, courtside, switched on. The umpire was not amused when it rang during the game. At the time Colin said \""I don't know who was ringing. I didn't realise I had left the phone in my bag.\"" One of only a handful of men to win three or more National singles titles, Haughton remains one of the most underrated modern English players.

Samos 4 was an American reconnaissance satellite which was lost in a launch failure in 1961. It was a film-return reconnaissance spacecraft, meaning that it returned images in a film capsule at the end of its mission. It was operated as part of the Samos programme. Samos 4 was the first of three Samos-E5 spacecraft to be launched; Samos-E5 satellites were based on an Agena-B, and carried a camera with a focal length of 1.67 metres (5 ft 6 in), and a resolution of 1.5 metres (4 ft 11 in). The launch of Samos 4 occurred at 20:45:47 UTC on 22 November 1961. An Atlas LV-3A Agena-B rocket was used, flying from Launch Complex 1-1 at the Point Arguello Naval Air Station. Four minutes and four seconds into the flight, the rocket's first stage attitude control system malfunctioned, and control over the rocket's pitch was lost. The rest of the flight proceeded nominally, however by the time the second stage ignited it had pitched up by 160 degrees and was hence facing in the wrong direction. Its three-minute-41-second burn reduced the vehicle's velocity instead of increasing it, and as a result the satellite failed to achieve orbit. Samos 4 was to have operated in a Sun-synchronous low Earth orbit. It was designed to operate for between 15 and 30 days.	ArtificialSatellite
The Free Democratic Party or Radical Democratic Party (German: Freisinnig-Demokratische Partei, FDP; French: Parti radical-démocratique, PRD; Italian: Partito liberale-radicale svizzero, PLR; Romansh: Partida liberaldemocrata svizra, PLD) was a liberal political party in Switzerland. Formerly one of the major parties in Switzerland, on 1 January 2009 it merged with the Liberal Party of Switzerland to form FDP.The Liberals. The FDP was formed in 1894 from the Radicals, who had dominated Swiss politics since the 1830s, standing in opposition to the Catholic conservatives, and who from the creation of the federal state in 1848 until 1891 formed the federal government. The FDP remained dominant until the introduction of proportional representation in 1919. From 1945 to 1987, it alternated with the Social Democratic Party to be the largest party. In 1959, the party took two seats in the magic formula. The party declined in the 1990s and 2000s (decade), as it was put under pressure by the Swiss People's Party. In response, the party formed closer relations with the smaller Liberal Party, leading to their formal merger in 2009.	PoliticalParty
General Francisco Rizzo was the acting Spanish Governor-General of the Philippines, from August 13 to September 1898, after the Battle of Manila. He relieved General Fermin Jáudenes as Acting Governor-General on August 13. Sources reported that Rizzo relocated the Spanish capital from Manila to Malolos, which was also Aguinaldo’s capital. An uneasy truce occurred between the remaining Spanish and Aguinaldo. The French Consulate in Manila considered General Rizzo “to be a good man, but lacks leadership qualities”. During General Rizzo’s reign, General Elwell Otis relieved General Wesley Merritt on August 29, as Commander, Department of the Pacific, and as the U.S. Military Governor of the Philippine Islands. In General Otis’ reports, he never mentioned Governor-General Rizzo, but apparently communicated almost exclusively with Spanish General Diego de los Rios, who then commanded the remnants of the Spanish Army in the Visayas and south Philippines. Rizzo was ultimately replaced by de los Rios as Governor-General in September 1898.	President

The Battle of Vukovar (Croatian: Bitka za Vukovar, Serbian: Битка за Вуковар, Bitka za Vukovar) was an 87-day siege of Vukovar in eastern Croatia by the Yugoslav People's Army (JNA), supported by various paramilitary forces from Serbia, between August and November 1991. Before the Croatian War of Independence the Baroque town was a prosperous, mixed community of Croats, Serbs and other ethnic groups. As Yugoslavia began to break up, Serbia's President Slobodan Milošević and Croatia's President Franjo Tuđman began pursuing nationalist politics. In 1990, an armed insurrection was started by Croatian Serb militias, supported by the Serbian government and paramilitary groups, who seized control of Serb-populated areas of Croatia. The JNA began to intervene in favour of the rebellion, and conflict broke out in the eastern Croatian region of Slavonia in May 1991. In August, the JNA launched a full-scale attack against Croatian-held territory in eastern Slavonia, including Vukovar. Vukovar was defended by around 1,800 lightly armed soldiers of the Croatian National Guard (ZNG) and civilian volunteers, against up to 36,000 JNA troops and Serb paramilitaries equipped with heavy armour and artillery. During the battle, shells and rockets were fired into the town at a rate of up to 12,000 a day. At the time, it was the fiercest and most protracted battle seen in Europe since 1945, and Vukovar was the first major European town to be entirely destroyed since the Second World War. When Vukovar fell on 18 November 1991, several hundred soldiers and civilians were massacred by Serb forces and at least 31,000 civilians were expelled from the town and its surroundings. Most of Vukovar was ethnically cleansed of its non-Serb population and became part of the self-declared Republic of Serbian Krajina. Several Serb military and political officials, including Milošević, were later indicted and in some cases jailed for war crimes committed during and after the battle. The battle exhausted the JNA and proved a turning point in the Croatian war. A ceasefire was declared a few weeks later. Vukovar remained in Serb hands until 1998, when it was peacefully reintegrated into Croatia. It has since been rebuilt but has less than half of its pre-war population and many buildings are still scarred by the battle. Its two principal ethnic communities remain deeply divided and it has not regained its former prosperity.	MilitaryConflict

Harry James Carpenter (b. Liss 20 October 1901 – d. Oxford 24 May 1993) was an English bishop and theologian. He was Warden of Keble College, Oxford (1939–1955) and then 37th Bishop of Oxford (1955–1970.).

He initiated the ecumenical discussions which eventually resulted in the building of the Church of Christ the Cornerstone in Milton Keynes. There is a parish school named after Carpenter in the Oxfordshire village of North Newington.	ChristianBishop
The Třemešná ve Slezsku - Osoblaha railway is a narrow gauge line connecting Třemešná ve Slezsku on the Krnov - Głuchołazy line with the border town Osoblaha. It is one of the three remaining narrow gauge railway lines with regular passenger traffic in the Czech Republic and the last one operated by the state-owned railway company České dráhy. In the 1870s the owners of a sugar refinery in Osoblaha were looking for a railway connection of their town. From a financial point of view, the best alternative was a connection to the railway network in neighbouring Prussia. However, the government in Vienna refused it on political and military grounds. On 14 December 1898 a line from Třemešná was opened. Since 1958 the trains are operated by diesel-electric locomotives T 47.0.	RailwayLine

"Larkin Irvin Smith (June 26, 1944 – August 13, 1989) was an American politician from Mississippi serving for seven months until he was killed in a plane crash in Perry County, Mississippi in 1989. Smith was born in Poplarville, Mississippi to Nona Orene Bounds and her husband Hezekiah K. Smith, Sr. Smith was named after his maternal grandfather Larkin Bounds and his maternal uncle Irvin E. Bounds. He received his bachelor's degree from William Cary College and then served at various positions in the police forces in both Pearl River and then Harrison counties. He became the police chief in Gulfport and thereafter the Harrison County sheriff. In 1988, Smith ran for the U.S. House of Representatives as a Republican from Mississippi's 5th congressional district in the southern portion of the state after eight-term incumbent Trent Lott gave up the seat to make a successful run for the Senate. He defeated Democratic State Senator Gene Taylor and took office on January 3, 1989. However, Smith died on the night of August 13 in a plane crash in rural Perry County near Gulfport after returning from opening the Little League baseball \""Dixie Youth World Series\"" in Hattiesburg. The bodies of Smith and pilot Chuck Vierling were not recovered until morning of the next day after a search in which rescuers had to bulldoze their way through the forest in which Smith's single-engine plane crashed. Smith's death was the second death in one week of a U.S. Representative in a plane crash. Representative Mickey Leland of Texas died in another plane crash in Ethiopia on August 7, 1989. At the Dixie Youth World Series, two events occurred that would later take on ironic, tragic notes. Then-Mississippi Representative Sonny Montgomery of Meridian helped open the series along with Smith. As part of the opening festivities, a group of skydivers would parachute out of an airplane onto the playing field. Shortly afterward, Smith delivered a few remarks among which he joked \""We're really glad to be here, but Sonny and I really wanted to sky dive in . . . Of course, if we had, you'd have been looking for us all night!\"" And then afterward, as Montgomery would later recall \""Our last conversation at the series was talking about the loss of Representative Leland, and I told Larkin that he should be careful in traveling and performing his duties.\"" Smith did not normally fly from Hattiesburg to Gulfport, but as he had attended a memorial service on the coast honoring victims of Hurricane Camille on the twentieth anniversary of the storm, he wished to reach Hattiesburg for the baseball event and felt pressed for time. Taylor would succeed Smith in a special election held some two months after the crash. Taylor was reelected every two years until 2010, when he was defeated by Republican State Representative Steven Palazzo. Smith's widow, Sheila Smith, ran unsuccessfully against Taylor in 1990 for the seat."	Congressman

Cherry Red Airline, also known as the Cherry Air Service, was the first airline in Prince Albert, Saskatchewan. It was founded by Norman Cherry and H. Holroyde in 1928. Cherry noticed an unmet demand for transportation services by mines in Saskatchewan, especially Consolidated Mining and Smelting, and decided to create an airline to meet that need. He hired pilot Alva Malone and partnered with H. Holroyde. The airline had a fleet consisting of two airplanes: a two-seat Pheasant biplane and a six passenger Buhl Airsedan. To earn extra revenue, Cherry decided to issue stamps starting at $0.10 for carrying airmail, making the airline the first airmail provider in Prince Albert. Existing stamps issued by the company are sought after by collectors. The great depression brought about the end of the airline as mine traffic dried up. by 1932, the company had failed. The Buhl Airsedan had previously been lost in an accident with no fatalities. The Pheasant biplane was sold and, in 1932, it crash landed, rendering it inoperable. The plane languished in storage until the Moose Jaw branch of the Western Development Museum acquired it in 1950. Volunteers worked from 1960 to 1964 to restore it, and it has been in the museum's permanent collection ever since. It is the oldest surviving airplane in Saskatchewan.	Airline

"The Detroit Red Wings are a professional ice hockey team based in Detroit, Michigan. They are members of the Atlantic Division in the Eastern Conference of the National Hockey League (NHL) and are one of the Original Six teams of the league. Founded in 1926, the team was known as the Detroit Cougars from then until 1930. For the 1930–31 and 1931–32 seasons the team was called the Detroit Falcons, and in 1932 changed their name to the Red Wings. As of 2016, the Red Wings have won the most Stanley Cup championships (11) of any NHL franchise based in the United States, and are third overall in total NHL championships, behind the Montreal Canadiens (24) and Toronto Maple Leafs (13). They play home games in the 20,027 capacity Joe Louis Arena after having spent over 40 years playing in Olympia Stadium. The Red Wings are one of the most popular franchises in the NHL, and fans and commentators refer to Detroit and its surrounding areas as \""Hockeytown,\"" which has been a registered trademark owned by the franchise since 1996. Between the 1933–34 and 1965–66 seasons, the Red Wings missed the playoffs only four times. Between the 1966–67 and 1990–91 seasons, the Red Wings made the playoffs only eight times in 25 seasons. During the last 11 years of this stretch, only five of the League's 21 teams did not make the post-season, yet the Wings still managed to miss the playoffs five times. This rough period for the team provoked the nickname of the \""Dead Wings.\"" Near the end of that 25-year period, however, the Red Wings advanced to the Conference Finals twice. Since then, the Red Wings have been one of the most successful NHL teams in the last quarter century, with six regular season first-place finishes, and winning the Stanley Cup four times in six Finals appearances. They have made the playoffs in 29 of the last 31 seasons; their playoff streak currently stands at 25 in a row (1991–2016), which is the longest current streak of post-season appearances in all of North American professional sports."

The Orthodox Ohrid Archbishopric (Serbian, Macedonian: Православна Охридска Архиепископија, Pravoslavna Ohridska Arhiepiskopija) is an autonomous Eastern Orthodox Archbishopric with canonical jurisdiction over the territory of the Republic of Macedonia. It is the only canonical Eastern Orthodox Church in the Republic of Macedonia and is in full communion with all other Eastern Orthodox Churches. The Orthodox Ohrid Archbishopric has been refused registration by the Macedonian State Religion Commission on the grounds that one group may be registered for each confession and that the name was not sufficiently distinct from that of the Macedonian Orthodox Church (MOC). MOC is recognized by the State Religion Commission but not by any other Orthodox churches, which consider its unilateral 1967 declaration of autocephaly a breach of canon law. The Archbishopric claims inheritance from the Ohrid Archbishopric of Justiniana prima and all Bulgaria (Bulgarian: Охридска Архиепископиия на Юстинияна първа и цяла България, Greek: Αρχιεπίσκοπος της πρωτης 'Ιουστινιανης και πάσης Βουλγαριας), founded in 1019, by Basil II.

William Stoughton (1631 – July 7, 1701) was a colonial magistrate and administrator in the Province of Massachusetts Bay. He was in charge of what have come to be known as the Salem Witch Trials, first as the Chief Justice of the Special Court of Oyer and Terminer in 1692, and then as the Chief Justice of the Superior Court of Judicature in 1693. In these trials he controversially accepted spectral evidence (based on supposed demonic visions). Unlike some of the other magistrates, he never admitted to the possibility that his acceptance of such evidence was in error. After graduating from Harvard College in 1650, he continued religious studies in England, where he also preached. Returning to Massachusetts in 1662, he chose to enter politics instead of the ministry. An adept politician, he served in virtually every government through the period of turmoil in Massachusetts that encompassed the revocation of its first charter in 1684 and the introduction of its second charter in 1692, including the unpopular rule of Sir Edmund Andros in the late 1680s. He served as lieutenant governor of the province from 1692 until his death in 1701, acting as governor (in the absence of an appointed governor) for about six years. He was one of the province's major landowners, partnering with Joseph Dudley and other powerful figures in land purchases, and it was for him that the town of Stoughton, Massachusetts was named.

Ferdinand (March 12, 1983 – 2002) was a Thoroughbred racehorse who won the 1986 Kentucky Derby and 1987 Breeders' Cup Classic. He was voted the 1987 Eclipse Award for Horse of the Year. He entered stud in 1989 and was later sold to a breeding farm in Japan in 1994. Much to the outrage of many horse racing enthusiasts, reports indicate that in 2002 Ferdinand was sent to slaughter in Japan with no fanfare or notice to previous owners. He likely became either pet food or steaks for human consumption. Ferdinand's death was the catalyst for the Ferdinand Fee, an optional donation program to fund keeping old racehorses alive, and Friends of Ferdinand, a nonprofit group formed in 2005 with the goal of transitioning retired racehorses into second careers. In September 2006, the United States House of Representatives approved H.R. 503, the American Horse Slaughter Prevention Act, which would ban the slaughter of horses in the United States.

Styggmann  or Styggemann is the highest mountain of Skrimfjella in southern Norway. A legend about the mountain claims it used to be the home of a troll. The troll hated people walking on his mountain, disturbing his rest, so he used to lie on top of the mountain to scare them away. If someone came too close, he threw rocks and boulders at them. If you walk the path to Sørmyrseter, you can still see some of them. The troll was careful only to be outside when it was cloudy, but once he was surprised by the sun and turned to stone. You can still clearly see its nose, mouth and chin if you look from the right angle, which is where the mountain has its name from; the ugly man.	Mountain

Astrid Ridge is an undersea ridge on the continental margin of Dronning Maud Land, East Antarctica. It is present on the GEBCO 5th edition charts. The name was approved by the Advisory Committee for Undersea Features in June 1987. The ocean along the continental margin of Dronning Maud Land, the Riiser-Larsen and Lazarev seas, are dominated by three topographic features: Astrid Ridge, Maud Rise, a large volcanic plateau in the Lazarev Sea (3°E, 65°S), and Gunnerus Ridge (33.5°E), probably underlain by continental crust. Astrid Ridge, extending from 65°S to the Antarctic margin and located between 9°E and 17°E, forms the eastern border of the Lazarev Sea and the western border of the Riiser-Larsen Sea. It is divided into two parts by the Astrid Fracture Zone: south of 67°S Astrid Ridge stretches N-S while the northern part follows the SW—NE direction of the fracture zone. The geological evolution of the Astrid Ridge remains enigmatic. The Riiser-Larsen Sea is a conjugate basin to the Mozambique Basin (in the ocean east of southern Africa) and the two once formed the first ocean to open during the break-up of Gondwana.Astrid Ridge is a large volcanic features closely related to this 160 Ma break-up during which oceanic crust began to form in the Riiser-Larsen Sea. West of Astrid Ridge, however, neither oceanic crust nor magnetic anomalies have been found and this area is therefore interpreted as stretched continental crust and Astrid Ridge as a former continental margin created by volcanism during the break-up.

"\""Hey Little Tomboy\"" is a song written by Brian Wilson for American rock band the Beach Boys, released on their 1978 album M.I.U. Album, and as the B-side to their single \""Peggy Sue\"". The song was nearly included as a track on Adult/Child before the album was rejected. The Beach Boys' recording originates from March–October 1976 15 Big Ones/Love You sessions. Wilson, describing \""Hey Little Tomboy\"" as a contender for the Love You track list, said: \""It's about a little girl who is sort of a rough neck, and this guy convinces her to become a pretty girl, and sure enough she slowly turns into a pretty—she starts shaving her legs and wearing short sticks—puts lipstick on and makeup. So she's a little tomboy. … We're very happy with it.\"" Biographer Peter Ames Carlin wrote: \""[the song] reveled uncomfortably in an adolescent girl who is putting away her skateboard and baseball mitt in order to get hot and heavy with the swain portrayed by Mike [Love]. … [it] may be the most unsettling moment in the entire recorded history of the Beach Boys.\"""	Single

At birth he was named Yang Zhaoxiong and was later named Mengxiang, and then Shaohou, commonly known as \""Mr. Big\"". Yang Shaohou studied with his father Yang Jianhou (楊健候; 1839–1917) and also with his uncle Yang Banhou (楊班侯; 1837-1890). Yang Shaohou was also known to have had a very forceful nature, and both of these masters are considered to have been very demanding teachers; only interested in teaching those that could stand their tough training regimes. In the early years he taught the 'middle frame' that was developed by his father, but later began developing his own signature style likely developed from the techniques taught to him by his uncle. This form or style was referred to as 'small circle'. This was characterized by high and low postures with small movements done in a sometimes slow and sometimes sudden manner. His fajin was hard and crisp, accompanied by sudden sounds. Master Yang Jun describes him in this way \""The spirit from his eyes would shoot out in all directions, flashing like lightning. Combined with a sneer, a sinister laugh, and the sounds of \""Heng!\"" and \""Ha!\"", his imposing manner was quite threatening.\"" During practice with his students, Yang Shaohou was not known for pulling his punches."

Amanita caesarea, commonly known in English as Caesar's mushroom, is a highly regarded edible mushroom in the genus Amanita, native to southern Europe and North Africa. This mushroom can also be found in La Esperanza, Intibuca, Honduras, where a festival is celebrated annually in its honor. This mushroom was first described by Giovanni Antonio Scopoli in 1772. This mushroom was a favorite of early rulers of the Roman Empire. It has a distinctive orange cap, yellow gills and stipe. Organic acids have been isolated from this species. Similar orange-capped species occur in North America and India. It was known to and valued by the Ancient Romans, who called it Boletus, a name now applied to a very different type of fungus.	Fungus

Dear Deidre is the British newspaper The Sun's long running agony aunt column written by Deidre Sanders. June Deidre Sanders (born 9 June 1945), a graduate of Sheffield University, has been responsible for the feature which bears her name since November 1980. Each day there are four or five dilemmas sent in anonymously by readers, which are published and answered by Deidre. There is also a week-long series of photos that picture a particular problem, with Deidre giving advice at the end. In addition, several different premium rate advice lines are published, giving recorded messages on problems that readers may have. Anybody that has a problem can email Deidre and they will receive a personal reply. Recurring themes include erection and orgasm problems, incest, having or imagining threesomes, problems with parents, loneliness, addiction to prostitutes, and sex in strange places. Many of the predicaments featured are fairly improbable, and it is the opinion of some that they are more than likely fabricatons. During a piece of news, Deidre will sometimes give humorous advice to a celebrity who is having personal problems. One example of this was after José Mourinho called Arsène Wenger a voyeur, and there was a casebook featuring Arsène peeking into Chelsea's training ground, and a letter from him, written in the type of French seen in 'Allo 'Allo!.

Verne R. Anderson (19 July 1937–October 1984) was a Canadian alpine ski competitor and coach. He was a member of Canada's first national ski team competing in one Winter Olympics, and was head coach of the Canadian team at a subsequent Winter Olympics. Anderson was born in Nelson, British Columbia, and was a member of Canada's first national ski team formed in 1959. He was a member of the Canadian team at the 1960 Winter Olympics held at Squaw Valley, California competing in all three alpine skiing disciplines for men. He placed 19th in slalom with a time of 2:29.3, 24th in giant slalom with a time of 1:56.1, and 22nd in downhill with a time of 2:15.9. During that era, the results from Olympics were used to determine the World Championship for alpine combined. Anderson's results gave him eighth place in the alpine combined. Anderson again represented Canada at the 1962 World Championships where he earned the best results amongst Canadian competitors in all the alpine events and placing seventh in the alpine combined. He then retired from competition and became a coach for the Canadian Alpine ski team; the first Canadian to hold that role. He subsequently took on the role of head coach for the team. Anderson's coaching career included coaching Olympic gold medallist Nancy Greene. At the time, funding for Canadian skiers were very limited. In order for Greene and Anderson to go to Europe for training and competitions, local community fund raising provided the support. Anderson coached until 1968 when he resigned to focus on his job as vice president at a ski boot manufacturing company. Anderson was inducted into the Canadian Ski Hall of Fame in 1990.	Skier

The Moon is Earth's only permanent natural satellite. It is the fifth-largest natural satellite in the Solar System, and the largest among planetary satellites relative to the size of the planet that it orbits (its primary). It is the second-densest satellite among those whose densities are known (after Jupiter's satellite Io). The average distance of the Moon from the Earth is 384,400 km (238,900 mi), or 1.28 light-seconds. The Moon is thought to have formed about 4.5 billion years ago, not long after Earth. There are several hypotheses for its origin; the most widely accepted explanation is that the Moon formed from the debris left over after a giant impact between Earth and a Mars-sized body called Theia. The Moon is in synchronous rotation with Earth, always showing the same face, with its near side marked by dark volcanic maria that fill the spaces between the bright ancient crustal highlands and the prominent impact craters. It is the second-brightest regularly visible celestial object in Earth's sky, after the Sun, as measured by illuminance on Earth's surface. Its surface is actually dark, although compared to the night sky it appears very bright, with a reflectance just slightly higher than that of worn asphalt. Its prominence in the sky and its regular cycle of phases have made the Moon an important cultural influence since ancient times on language, calendars, art, mythology, and apparently, the menstrual cycles of the female of the human species. The Moon's gravitational influence produces the ocean tides, body tides, and the slight lengthening of the day. The Moon's current orbital distance is about thirty times the diameter of Earth, with its apparent size in the sky almost the same as that of the Sun, resulting in the Moon covering the Sun nearly precisely in total solar eclipse. This matching of apparent visual size will not continue in the far future. The Moon's linear distance from Earth is currently increasing at a rate of 3.82 ± 0.07 centimetres (1.504 ± 0.028 in) per year, but this rate is not constant. The Soviet Union's Luna programme was the first to reach the Moon with unmanned spacecraft in 1959; the United States' NASA Apollo program achieved the only manned missions to date, beginning with the first manned lunar orbiting mission by Apollo 8 in 1968, and six manned lunar landings between 1969 and 1972, with the first being Apollo 11. These missions returned over 380 kg (840 lb) of lunar rocks, which have been used to develop a geological understanding of the Moon's origin, the formation of its internal structure, and its subsequent history. Since the Apollo 17 mission in 1972, the Moon has been visited only by unmanned spacecraft.	Planet

"The Devil and the Good Lord (French: Le Diable et le Bon Dieu) is a 1951 play by French philosopher Jean-Paul Sartre. The play concerns the moral choices of its characters, warlord Goetz, clergy Heinrich, communist leader Nasti and others during the German Peasants' War. The first act follows Goetz' transformation from vicious war criminal to a \""good\"" person of noble deeds, as during a siege of the town of Worms, he decides not to massacre its citizens. The play was first performed at the Théâtre-Antoine in Paris, where it opened on 7 June 1951 and ran until March 1952. This production was directed by Louis Jouvet. Of all his dramatic writings, The Devil and the Good Lord was Sartre's favourite. He based the character of Goetz on his analysis of the psychology and morality of the writer Jean Genet, which he had developed more substantially in his Saint Genet (1952)."	Play

Superman Returns is a video game based on the movie of the same name, It was developed by EA Tiburon and published by Electronic Arts in conjunction with Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment and DC Comics. It features a story arc from the movie, which was released on June 28, 2006, and more than 60 years of comic book content. EA Tiburon, known for its Madden NFL game series, has claimed that the game combines strong creative vision and compelling new technology to deliver a powerful and emotional gaming experience to their consumers, and they will experience a real sense of flying while mastering Superman's superhero powers to save Metropolis. In the game, Superman combats Bizarro, who does not appear in the movie, as well as other classic villains (including Metallo, Mongul, and Teen Titans member Bumblebee) as well as being able to play as Bizarro for a short period of time in one of the many minigames inserted into the game. The game was produced for the Xbox 360 as well as the Playstation 2 and Nintendo DS. A port for the PlayStation Portable was planned but cancelled due to it not having enough power to support the game. Electronic Arts and Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment secured an all-star cast for the voices in Superman Returns: The Videogame. The game features the voice and likeness of Brandon Routh (Superman/Clark Kent) as well as the voices of Kevin Spacey (Lex Luthor), Kate Bosworth (Lois Lane), Parker Posey (Kitty Kowalski) and Sam Huntington (Jimmy Olsen), all reprising their roles from the Warner Bros. Pictures film directed by Bryan Singer. The Nintendo DS version also features games based on the film, but they are fundamentally different from the console title. The games were delayed from their original release date (set to coincide with the theatrical release of the film) due to design complications and issues with polish on the console game. The handheld games were delayed in order to preserve a simultaneous release with non-handheld SKUs. The games were ultimately released on November 22, 2006 in the United States and November 30 in Australia, to coincide with the DVD release of Superman Returns.	VideoGame

"The Rose City Transit Company (RCT, or RCTC) was a private company that operated most mass transit service in the city of Portland, Oregon, from 1956 to 1969. It operated only within the city proper. Transit services connecting downtown Portland with suburbs outside the city but within the Portland metropolitan area were run by other private companies, mainly a consortium of four companies known collectively as the \""Blue Bus\"" lines. Rose City Transit was a wholly owned subsidiary of the Portland Traction Company (PTC), which was also its predecessor. Prior to the formation of RCT, most transit service in the city had been provided directly by Portland Traction under that name since the 1930s. After PTC's bus routes were transferred to Rose City Transit in 1956, PTC continued to run two interurban trolley lines (to Oregon City and Bellrose) under its own name, but those two lines – the only trolley car lines remaining in operation in Portland after abandonment of the last city streetcar lines in 1950 – were the only transit routes still operated directly by PTC, which otherwise was a freight railroad. Although RCT was a private company, it operated under a franchise agreement with the city of Portland, through which the city had some oversight control. Any fare increases or major service changes had to be approved by the city council. Many transit systems in the United States were changing from private to public control in the 1950s, as growth in private-car ownership and other factors made the provision of mass transit service an increasingly difficult business in which to make a profit. By 1962, all but two major West Coast cities had made the change and begun subsidizing transit, and one of those two exceptions was Portland, served by the Rose City Transit Company (with San Diego being the other). By 1967, RCT was the last remaining privately owned big-city transit system on the West Coast, after San Diego Transit became municipalized. Rose City Transit's annual ridership declined from 32.3 million in 1956 to 15.7 million in 1968. Effective December 1, 1969, a newly formed public authority, Tri-Met, replaced Rose City Transit, taking over all operation and facilities, and using the same personnel, under an agreement reached between RCT, the city council and Tri-Met."

"Leon Charles Weiss (December 10, 1882 – April 1, 1953) was a politically connected American architect who designed most major monuments of the Huey Pierce Long, Jr., gubernatorial administration in Louisiana, including the skyscraper-shaped capitol, the governor's mansion, and Louisiana State University buildings, all in Baton Rouge, and the LSU Medical School in New Orleans. Weiss was born in Farmerville in Union Parish, north of Ruston. In 1903, he graduated from engineering school at Tulane University in New Orleans He formed the Weiss and Dreyfous firm in New Orleans in 1920 with F. Julius Dreyfous. The name was changed in 1927 to Weiss, Dreyfous, and Seiferth, when Solis Seiferth entered the firm. In the 1920s, the firm designed the Jung and Pontchartrain hotels in New Orleans and the Eola Hotel in Natchez, Mississippi. They also designed the Granada Theatre in New Orleans, Louisiana. The three partners met Long and financially backed him for governor in 1928 and successfully opposed his impeachment in 1929. The company continued to design state buildings in the Richard Webster Leche administration (1936–1939). These included Charity Hospital (\""Big Charity\"") in New Orleans and other university structures. Weiss (not Dreyfous and Seiferth) was indicted in 1939 during the \""Louisiana Hayride\"" scandals for having used the United States mail to defraud in regard to an unspecific building contract for Louisiana Tech University in Ruston in Lincoln Parish in north Louisiana. Critics said that Weiss' trial was marked by \""guilt-by-association\"" tactics used by the U.S. attorney, Malcolm Lafargue, and by anti-Semitism. He was convicted in 1940 and imprisoned. He resumed his practice in 1952, only a year before his death. With Edward Silverstein, he managed to design an addition to the Jung Hotel. Weiss died in New Orleans."	Architect
Mickey's Steam Roller is a 1934 animated short film produced by Walt Disney Productions and released by United Artists. In the cartoon, Mickey Mouse is the driver of a steamroller which is hijacked by his two nephews. It was directed by David Hand and features the voices of Walt Disney as Mickey and Marcellite Garner as Minnie Mouse and Mickey's nephews. Although this is the third animated appearance of Mickey's nephews, it is the first to show only two of them. The film is therefore considered the first identifiable and most significant animated appearance of Morty and Ferdie Fieldmouse, Mickey's twin nephews from the Mickey Mouse comic strip. The film was also called The Steamroller during production, and Mickey's Steamroller upon its re-release. Disney archivist Dave Smith has also stylized the title as Mickey's Steam-Roller.

"\""Jurassic Park\"" is a parody of Jimmy Webb's single \""MacArthur Park\"" written and performed by \""Weird Al\"" Yankovic; it was released both as a single and as part of Yankovic's Alapalooza album in October 1993. \""Jurassic Park\"" was penned by Yankovic after he remembered the enjoyment he had when he combined a classic rock track with a recent movie topic with his 1985 song \""Yoda\"". Yankovic decided to combine the plot of the recent movie Jurassic Park—a film about a park on a fictional island where geneticists have succeeded in cloning dinosaurs. The song was paired with an elaborately animated music video, which was created by Mark Osborne and Scott Nordlund almost entirely via claymation. The video did not receive extensive play on MTV, although it was popular on The Box, VH1, and in Canada, where it was played on MuchMusic. The video, due to its animation, also later went on to be praised at various animation festivals worldwide. \""Jurassic Park\"" was met with mixed to positive reviews; while many reviewers enjoyed Yankovic's humor, others felt that the song did not satirize the source material, but instead merely recounted the plot to the movie. Webb himself was very pleased with the final result and has been known to sing the parody lyrics in concert. Although the single did not chart in the United States, it peaked at number 5 on the Canadian magazine The Record's single chart. The video was also nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Short Form Music Video at the 37th Grammy Awards, although it did not win."	Single

Septoria musiva, correct taxonomic name: Sphaerulina musiva (teleomorph: Mycosphaerella populorum), is an ascomycete fungus responsible of a leaf spot and canker disease on poplar trees. It is native on the eastern cottonwood poplar Populus deltoides, causing only a leaf spot symptom. On susceptible hybrid poplars, S. musiva causes necrotic lesions on the leaves which lead to premature defoliation, and cankers on the stem and branches which can reduce growth, predispose the tree to colonisation by secondary organisms, and cause stem breakage. In 2013, Quaedvlieg et al. introduced a new combination for this species: Sphaerulina musiva (Peck) Quaedvlieg, Verkley & Crous, as they found that the type strains of both the genus Mycosphaerella (linked to the anamorph genus Ramularia via Ramularia endophylla) and the genus Septoria (linked to the anamorph genus Septoria,via Septoria cytisi) clustered separately from the clade containing Sphaerulina musiva.

"Wilmeth Sidat-Singh (February 13, 1918 – May 9, 1943) was an African-American basketball and football player who was subject to segregation in college and professional sports in the 1930s. His parents were both African-American. After the death of his father, Elias Webb (a pharmacist), his mother, Pauline, married Samuel Sidat-Singh, a medical student from India who adopted Wilmeth, giving him his family name. After his graduation from Howard University, Dr. Sidat-Singh moved the family to Harlem and set up a family medical practice. Wilmeth showed great talent as an athlete and became a basketball star, leading DeWitt Clinton High School to the New York Public High School Athletic League championship in 1934. He received an offer of a basketball scholarship from Syracuse University and enrolled in 1935. While playing an intramural football game, an assistant football coach noticed his talent and asked him to join the football team. Sidat-Singh starred for Syracuse, playing a position equivalent to modern-day quarterback and starring for the basketball team as well. Syracuse University and nearby Cornell University were among the first collegiate football teams to include African-American players as starting backfield players. In that era, when games were played in Southern segregation states, African-American players from Northern schools were banned from the field. Because of his light complexion and name, Sidat-Singh was sometimes assumed to be a \""Hindu\"" (as people from India were often called by Americans during this time). However. shortly before a game against the University of Maryland, a black sportswriter, Sam Lacy wrote an article in The Baltimore Afro American, revealing Sidat-Singh's true racial identity. Wilmeth Sidat-Singh was held out of the game and Syracuse lost that game 0-13. In a rematch the following year at Syracuse, Sidat-Singh led the Orange to a lopsided victory (53-0) over Maryland. With unofficial bans on black players enacted in both the National Basketball League (NBL) and National Football League (NFL) Sidat-Singh played briefly for a professional barnstorming basketball team in Syracuse and then joined the Metropolitan Police Department of the District of Columbia. After U.S. entry into World War II, he applied and was accepted as a member of the Tuskegee Airmen, the only African-American unit in the U.S. Army Air Force, and won his wings as a pilot. Sidat-Singh died in 1943 during a training mission when the engine of his airplane failed. \""He died on a training flight when his stricken plane went down in Saginaw Bay, his parachute tangled in the fuselage.\"" He drowned in Lake Huron. In 2005, Syracuse University honored Wilmeth Sidat-Singh by retiring his number and hanging his basketball jersey in the rafters of the Carrier Dome. On Saturday, Nov. 9, 2013, the University of Maryland publicly apologized to surviving relatives from the Webb family at a ceremony during a football game with Syracuse University."	MilitaryPerson

"Charles Victor Tarbox, sometimes known as \""Percy\""(2 July 1891 – 15 June 1978) was an English cricketer who played over 200 first-class games for Worcestershire in the 1920s. He also played at minor counties level for Hertfordshire, and later still stood as a first-class umpire in both England and South Africa. Tarbox's career statistics were fairly modest, but as his obituary in Wisden noted, he frequently chipped in with a few useful runs or wickets, valuable commodities for the generally weak Worcestershire sides of the day. He achieved his best innings figures in his first season of 1921, in only the seventh match of his first-class career, when in June he claimed 7–55 against Somerset at Worcester.A few weeks later, and against the same opponents, he achieved what was to prove his only ten-wicket match haul, picking up 4–126 and then 6–32 in a big Worcestershire victory at Taunton.He ended 1921 with 629 runs at 17.97 and 47 wickets at 27.29. Wisden said that Tarbox \""never fulfilled the promise\"" of that first season.However, he continued to put in useful performances and was generally a regular in the team. His most productive seasons with the ball were 1927 and 1928, when he took 81 and 79 wickets respectively.As a batsman, the highlights were the only two centuries of his career: 103 not out against local rivals Warwickshire at Edgbaston in May 1925,and 109 – in an innings in which the second highest score was 29 – against Nottinghamshire at Trent Bridge in July 1927. The 1929 season was a very poor one for Tarbox – he averaged under 12 with the bat and over 42 with the ball – and Worcestershire released him at the end of the summer.That was the end of his first-class playing career, but he returned to his home county of Hertfordshire and played for them for several years in the Minor Counties Championship; for them he scored relatively few runs but took many wickets, including 6–13 against Berkshire in July 1931. After his last game for Hertfordshire in 1934, Tarbox became an umpire, and stood in over 150 English first-class games between 1936 and 1947. He then added another ten matches as an umpire in South Africa."	Cricketer

Ælfnoth or Alnoth (died 700) was an English hermit and martyr. Little is known of his life, though he is mentioned in Jocelyn's life of Saint Werburgh as a pious neatherd at Weedon, who bore with great patience the ill-treatment of the bailiff placed over him, and who afterwards became a hermit in a very lonely spot, where he was eventually murdered by two robbers. On this ground he was honoured as a martyr; and there was some concourse of pilgrims to his tomb at Stowe near Bugbrooke in Northamptonshire. Ælfnoth is not mentioned in any surviving early calendars; his feast was later kept on 27 February or on 25 November.	Saint

"The olm or proteus (Proteus anguinus) is an aquatic salamander in the family Proteidae, the only exclusively cave-dwelling chordate species found in Europe. In contrast to most amphibians, it is entirely aquatic; it eats, sleeps, and breeds underwater. Living in caves found in the Dinaric Alps, it is endemic to the waters that flow underground through the extensive limestone of the karst of Central and Southeastern Europe, specifically southern Slovenia, the basin of the Soča River (Italian: Isonzo) near Trieste, Italy, southwestern Croatia, and Bosnia and Herzegovina. It is also called the \""human fish\"" by locals because of its skin color, similar to that of Caucasian people (translated literally from Slovene: človeška ribica, Bosnian: čovječja ribica and Croatian: čovječja ribica), as well as \""cave salamander\"" or \""white salamander\"". In Slovenia, it is also known by the name močeril, which translates as \""the one that burrows into wetness\"". It was first mentioned in 1689 by the local naturalist Valvasor in his Glory of the Duchy of Carniola, who reported that, after heavy rains, the olms were washed up from the underground waters and were believed by local people to be a cave dragon's offspring. This animal is most notable for its adaptations to a life of complete darkness in its underground habitat. The olm's eyes are undeveloped, leaving it blind, while its other senses, particularly those of smell and hearing, are acutely developed. It also lacks any pigmentation in its skin. It has three toes on its forelimbs, but only two toes on its hind feet. It also exhibits neoteny, retaining larval characteristics like external gills into adulthood, like some American amphibians, the axolotl and the mudpuppies (Necturus). The olm is the only species in the genus Proteus and the only European species of the family Proteidae, whose other extant genus is Necturus."	Amphibian

Richards Bay Airport (IATA: RCB, ICAO: FARB) is an airport in Richards Bay, South Africa. It is independently managed and not part of the network of larger airports operated by the parastatal Airports Company South Africa (ACSA). The Airport is managed by Indiza Airport Management, and is currently headed up by Manager Alvin Naidoo. The Airport is also home to one of the only Aviation Maintenance Companies in the Northern Natal Province, Alton Aero Engineering. South African Express Airways currently fly the only scheduled flight service in and out of Richards Bay, using a fleet of Bombardier Dash 8-Q300 series aircraft. In late 2011, after much speculation, it was confirmed that the airport would undergo a major upgrade that would render the airport's status as International. The expansion project however, has been put on hold pending an outcome to the issue of the local township of Mandlanzini, with residents having settled in the path of the intended runway extension. The upgrade comes at a crucial time, with South African Express Airways phasing out the Dash 8 Q300 aircraft. The fleet will be replaced with the new Q400 series aircraft, which is unable to operate out of Richards Bay Airport due to the limitations of the runway and taxiway infrastructure. It is expected that South African Express Airways will continue to operate a handful of Q300 aircraft until the expansion at Richards Bay Airport has been completed.	Airport

The General Confederation of Labour (Spanish: Confederación General del Trabajo, CGT) of Spain is an Anarcho-Syndicalist trade union, arisen from the 1979 split of CNT/AIT after the arrival of democracy and the following reorganization and restructuring process of the trade unions. As the largest anarchist trade union in the world, the CGT has a membership of approximately 60,000 people, while representing around 2 million workers through industrial committees and collective bargaining. It is especially strong today in Catalonia, where historically, anarchism had strong support. For historical reasons, the CGT is also a main player in the Spanish state railways, RENFE. It is also part of the industrial committee of SEAT, the Spanish car manufacturer and the largest company in Catalonia. Nonetheless, the CGT does not hold the majority in any important industrial committee at this moment. The CGT has been known to call for industrial action, without support of any other unions. Sometimes it had refused to accept collective bargaining agreements negotiated by other trade unions, unless these have been approved by general secret ballots. In that sense, the CGT has recently rejected a deal that resulted in layoffs of over six-hundred SEAT workers, about 5% of its labour force, due to weak sales. It also claimed that the number of CGT sympathizers who were laid off was disproportionately high. The other two main trade unions, CC.OO. and Unión General de Trabajadores (UGT), rejected this claim as baseless. No precise figures were provided by any of the unions to support these claims. After Francisco Franco's death and the end of dictatorship in Spain, anarchism made a comeback to the trade union scene, though with a major loss in status and influence in comparison with the II Republic period, affecting both the CNT and CGT. Currently, the CGT has 5.000 labor delegates. The CGT is a member of the European Federation of Alternative Syndicalism, FESAL.	TradeUnion

E 311 (known in Arabic as شارع ﺇ ٣١١) is a major road in the United Arab Emirates. It begins in Jebel Ali Free Zone in Dubai and extends eastward towards the Ras al-Khaimah emirate. Within Dubai city limits, E 311 has been called Sheikh Mohammad Bin Zayed Road since 2013. Prior to that it was called Emirates Road, but that name is now given to E 611, which was previously Dubai Bypass Road. It was originally designed by the Dubai Municipality to cut the traffic of heavy vehicles from the downtown area. However, due to a very bad road infrastructure in Sharjah, traffic bottle-necks are often seen near Dubai–Sharjah border. In 2006 it was re-developed by RTA in Dubai, creating 6 lanes on each side. In mid-2005, the road was extended to reach the UAE's northernmost emirate of Ras al-Khaimah, passing through the emirates of Ajman, Umm al-Quwain and Sharjah. There is also a project to extend the E 311 through Ras Al Khaimah to the UAE's northern border with Oman (Musandam Peninsula) In Dubai, Sheikh Mohammad Bin Zayed Road is a prime location for new projects as the area surrounding it can now be accessed easily. Many projects have been proposed or are in various stages of development along the road, including International City, Arabian Ranches, Dubailand, Dubai Silicon Oasis, Global Village, Sports City. Within the city of Dubai, Sheikh Mohammad Bin Zayed Road used to be known as the most dangerous road in the UAE, with 19 fatalities recorded on it within the first six months of 2006. But with improved road designs and replacement of several roundabouts with interchanges, flyovers, speed cameras and increase in lanes, it has become much safer to drive. This road is also used to commute from Jebel Ali area in Dubai to the old town of Dubai such as Bur Dubai and Deira. Sheikh Mohammad Bin Zayed Road is located in the east of Dubai, parallel to Sheikh Zayed Road (E11). People also use the Sheikh Mohammad Bin Zayed Road as an alternative to the Sheik Zayed Road which has toll gates (SALIK) that deduct AED 4 every time a vehicle passes beneath them. On 1 January 2013, Sheikh Mohammed Bin Rashid Al Maktoum, ruler of Dubai, ordered that the E 311 highway in Dubai be renamed from Emirates Road to Sheikh Mohammed Bin Zayed Road, in a tribute to General Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, Crown Prince of Abu Dhabi, for his role in advancing inclusive development nationwide. In 2015, a foreign crane driver attempted to hang himself after parking the crane in the middle of the road. Non-payment of wages was suspected to be the main reason behind this suicide attempt. Shocked motorists called police who were able to negotiate with the driver; it has been reported that he will face charges for attempted suicide.	Road

"Le Domaine Forget was three separate estates of three eminent Canadians at the turn of the twentieth century. Les Sablons was owned by Joseph Lavergne — a judge, and colleague of Sir Wilfrid Laurier. Hauterive was the property of Adolphe-Basile Routhier — a judge and the lyricist of the French language version of O Canada. Gil'Mont, which forms the major part of the Domaine Forget was the estate of Rodolphe Forget — a Member of Parliament and investor and entrepreneur in the Charlevoix region. In 1945 Les Petites Franciscaines de Marie, a religious order, first purchased Gil'Mont as the school \""Institut Familial\"" (Family Institute) and a year later bought the properties belonging to Judges Laverge and Routhier, in order to protect the privacy of the educational institution. In 1977 the school was converted into what is now known as Le Domaine Forget, a non-profit corporation with a mission of promoting the fine arts."	MusicFestival

"Clarence Leonard \""Kelly\"" Johnson (February 27, 1910 – December 21, 1990) was an American aeronautical and systems engineer. He is recognized for his contributions to a series of important aircraft designs, most notably the Lockheed U-2 and SR-71 Blackbird. Besides the first production aircraft to exceed Mach 3, he also produced the first fighter capable of Mach 2, the United States' first operational jet fighter, as well as the first U.S. fighter to exceed 400 mph, and many other contributions to a large number of aircraft. As a member and first team leader of the Lockheed Skunk Works, Johnson worked for more than four decades and is said to have been an \""organizing genius\"". He played a leading role in the design of over forty aircraft, including several honored with the prestigious Collier Trophy, acquiring a reputation as one of the most talented and prolific aircraft design engineers in the history of aviation. In 2003, as part of its commemoration of the 100th anniversary of the Wright Brothers' flight, Aviation Week & Space Technology ranked Johnson 8th on its list of the top 100 \""most important, most interesting, and most influential people\"" in the first century of aerospace. Hall Hibbard, Johnson's Lockheed boss, referring to Johnson's Swedish ancestry once remarked to Ben Rich: \""That damned Swede can actually see air.\"" Johnson also helped to design the Lockheed AQM-60 Kingfisher a decade before the famous SR-71. The Kingfisher was a highly successful single engine Mach 4.3 capable Ramjet composed mainly of steel, which was used to test American air defenses against nuclear missiles. The information and experience Johnson gained was later used to produce the A-12 spy plane for the Central Intelligence Agency. Johnson then used the combined knowledge of the Kingfisher and A-12 to produce the SR-71 Blackbird."	Engineer

Nectria is a genus of Ascomycete fungi. They are most often encountered as saprophytes on decaying wood but some species can also occur as parasites of trees, especially fruit trees (for example apple) and a number of other hardwood trees. Some species are significant pests causing diseases such as apple canker, Nectria twig blight, and coral spot in orchards. It is ubiquitous in cool temperate Europe and North America and appears to be an introduced species in New Zealand and Australia. The occurrence in New Zealand was first identified in 1996 in Otago and Southland although it is believed to have been present since the 1980s. In North America, Nectria infections have had economically important impacts on forestry and forest products including aspen, red oak, maple, beech, poplar, and birch. Species of Nectria also occur in warmer climates including island groups such as Hawaii. According to the Dictionary of the Fungi (10th edition, 2008), the genus contains 82 species.	Fungus

Located at Trago Mills Regional Shopping Centre, Newton Abbot, the 10 1⁄4 in (260 mm) ridable miniature railway Bickington Steam Railway was opened in 1988, using equipment recovered from the Suffolk Wildlife Park, which itself was taken from Rudyard Lake. It was built by Brian Nicholson, the headmaster of Waterhouses School in Staffordshire. Waterhouses was the junction for the Leek and Manifold Valley Light Railway. After being thwarted in an attempt to rebuild a portion of the Leek and Manifold Valley railway, Nicholson moved his railway, via Rudyard Lake and Suffolk, to Trago Mills. Originally the railway was a 1 mile (1.6 km) double loop around two lakes with one station, 'Trago Central', but in 2006 the railway grew over 1⁄2 mile (805 m), with an extension taking it to Trago's front car park. A three-track terminus and turntable was built and named the 'Riverside Station'. A third station was added in 2008, located at the far end of the Trago site on one of the original sections of line; this was named 'Goose Glen Halt'. This was constructed in the hope that shoppers would use the ride to return to their vehicles, a near half-mile uphill walk from the main shopping complex. Over a section of this line, the railway climbs one of the steepest inclines for any non rack railway in the UK. The railway is a member of Britains Great Little Railways	RailwayLine

Ogof Draenen (Welsh for Hawthorn Cave) is, at 66 km (official figure; the true length of passage is still being revised upward, with a rough modern approximation at it being 70 km), the longest cave system in Wales and the second longest in Great Britain behind the Three Counties System on the Cumbria/Lancashire/Yorkshire border. The cave was known only as a small entrance on a steep hillside until several years of digging broke through into major passage development in October 1994.

"The National Gallery of Arts is a state institution under the supervision of the Ministry of Culture. This highly important art institution functions based on the Law of Museums and the Law of Art and Culture of the Republic of Albania. The beginnings of the National Gallery of Arts can be traced back to the endeavors of a group of Albanian artists and the Arts’ Committee of 1946. Pinakoteka was the first institution of fine arts in Albania. After much toil and extensive efforts, the Gallery of Arts officially opened to the public in Tirana on 11 January 1954. The Gallery worked in two main directions: exhibiting the permanent collection and opening temporary exhibitions of Albanian and foreign artists. The new visions on the development and display of fine arts, as well as the new acquisitions increased the number of artworks at the Gallery’s disposal and brought about the need for a larger and more functional new building. The new venue opened on 29 November 1974. It was situated on the \""Martyrs of the Nation\"" Boulevard and it is the existing building where the National Gallery of Arts stands today. This new opening is the moment of reorganization and of the first rebuilding programme which consisted in establishing an administrative structure made up of several departments dealing with artistic activities. The fund of the new gallery, up to this time, counted 340 artworks and its archives counted 240 registered artists. From this moment onwards the Gallery of Arts functions as the only and most important national institution of exhibiting, conserving, studying, restoring, publishing, documenting and archiving the works of art in Albania. In 2009 and 2010, the National Gallery of Arts underwent important renovation works through a series of considerable private and public investments, which consisted in a qualitative reconstruction of interior spaces, aiming to preserve the original architectural project, as much as possible. Part of the major reconstruction of the National Gallery it has also been showing the permanent collection in May 2009, through a new visualizing concept, aiming to a better dissemination, education and information on cultural matters, for anever increasing Albanian and international public. Today the National Gallery preserves/ conserves over 5000 artworks. Besides the permanent collection which is focused on Socialist Realism art, famous Albanian artists, international ones and important collections have been part of the different exhibitions in the National Gallery of Arts. An important policy of the NGA activities are also the educational programs, where many children and students participate.. Visitors of the National Gallery have the opportunity to enjoy the activities and the exhibitions’ rich program, to know more about Albanian visual art."	Museum

In addition, this international event is an opportunity to present Berlin as a vibrant location of political and economic debate. The upcoming east forum Berlin 2016 takes place during Germany's OSCE Chairmanship in the middle of new deadlocks and new dynamics that characterise the transforming economic and political realities in the region from Europe to Asia. The two opposing trends are embedded firstly, in new division lines leading to an unfamiliar status quo of alienation. And, secondly, they are surrounded by recently formed alliances consisting of as yet poorly known stakeholders, which create new spheres of influence. These dynamics offer fresh potential for growth but also involve geopolitical and geo-economic challenges for all stakeholders in the region.	Convention

"\""The Beatles Play the Residents and the Residents Play the Beatles\"" is a 1977 single by the Residents. The A-side, \""Beyond the Valley of a Day in the Life\"", is an audio collage of recordings by the Beatles and John Lennon, with a looped clip from the Beatles' third Christmas record, in which Paul McCartney says \""Please everybody, if we haven't done what we could have done, we've tried.\"" The B-side, \""Flying\"", is a cover of the Beatles song, selected because it (along with \""Dig It\"") is one of the few songs to be credited to all four Beatles. At one point, one of the Residents quotes the clip from the McCartney interview used on the A-side and laughs maniacally. The single, particularly the B-side, reflects the Residents' boredom with pop music and their tendency to perform deconstructionist covers, perhaps shown most notably on their album The Third Reich 'n Roll. The album was originally released as a 7\"" single that was limited and numbered to 500 copies, with three different hand-screened sleeves."	Single

It was their 48th roller coaster designed. Cornball Express, as with other rides at the park, is also notable for being 'shoehorned' into other rides at the park. The ride weaves through and uses portions of the Hoosier Hurricane's structure in some parts, glides over the Kiddieland section of the park, wraps around the park's Tig'rr Coaster, and may sometimes 'duel' with the Rocky's Rapids Log Flume attraction. The name Cornball Express was also a candidate to be the name for the Hoosier Hurricane while it was being designed, however the name was tossed in favor for the latter.	RollerCoaster

Another parish church, Christ Church, Carmarthen, was built in 1867 to cater for the English members of the congregation of this expanding parish so that Eglwys Dewi Sant could concentrate on providing Welsh services for Welsh-speaking parishioners. The church was originally a rectangular building on a north/south axis with a tower at the front. In 1853–55, a new nave was added on an east/west axis and the interior of the church was rearranged with the altar and organ in different positions. The church was designated a Grade II-listed building on 19 May 1981, being \""a prominent C19 suburban church with landmark tower.

The constitutional crisis of 1993 was a political stand-off between the Russian president Boris Yeltsin and the Russian parliament that was resolved by using military force. The relations between the president and the parliament had been deteriorating for some time. The constitutional crisis reached a tipping point on September 21, 1993, when President Yeltsin aimed to dissolve the country's legislature (the Congress of People's Deputies and its Supreme Soviet), although the president did not have the power to dissolve the parliament according to the constitution. Yeltsin used the results of the referendum of April 1993 to justify his actions. In response, the parliament declared that the president's decision was null and void, impeached Yeltsin and proclaimed vice president Aleksandr Rutskoy to be acting president. The situation deteriorated at the beginning of October. On October 3, demonstrators removed police cordons around the parliament and, urged by their leaders, took over the Mayor's offices and tried to storm the Ostankino television centre. The army, which had initially declared its neutrality, stormed the Supreme Soviet building in the early morning hours of October 4 by Yeltsin's order, and arrested the leaders of the resistance. The ten-day conflict became the deadliest single event of street fighting in Moscow's history since the Russian Revolution. According to government estimates, 187 people were killed and 437 wounded, while estimates from non-governmental sources put the death toll at as high as 2,000.	MilitaryConflict
Matt Brady (born October 1, 1965) is an American college basketball coach and the former men's basketball coach at James Madison University. He was introduced at a press conference on March 26, 2008. Brady was formerly the head coach at Marist College, departing with a 73–50 record in four years. He took the Red Foxes to a MAAC regular-season championship in 2007. Marist then advanced to the NIT, where it defeated Oklahoma State in the first round. The NIT victory was the first ever postseason victory for Marist. At Madison, Brady took over a program that hadn't had a winning record since going 20–9 in the 1999–2000 season under Sherman Dillard. However, Dillard had little success in ensuing seasons and, like his successor, Dean Keener, resigned under pressure. Brady inherited an experienced core of upperclassmen from Keener and, with a skilled group of freshmen, engineered a respectable inaugural campaign, leading the Dukes to an 18–13 regular season record. Thanks to the addition of a new postseason invitational—the CollegeInsider.com Tournament—Madison achieved its first 20-win season since 1994, when Hall of Fame coach Lefty Driesell led the program to the NCAA Tournament. The record dipped significantly in 2009–10, in part because of the loss of two key players to injuries: point guard Devon Moore, an all-rookie pick in the CAA in 2009, and forward Andrey Semenov. Brady was released on March 14, 2016 by James Madison.	CollegeCoach

"The Adventure Babies were a Stafford-based Brit pop band, founded by Matt Tedstone, Dave Atherton and Jez Bramwell in 1990. The band had three releases on the Factory Records label: \n*  The Camper Van (EP) (FAC 319, 1991) \n*  Laugh (album) (FACT 335, 1992) \n*  \""Barking Mad\"" (single) (FACT 347, 1992) Possibly their greatest claim to fame was being the last band signed by Factory Records before it went bankrupt. At the time of Factory's bankruptcy in 1992, test pressings had been made of a second single from the Laugh album. The band continued playing with new guitarist Vulch (Bryan Wilkin), formerly working with Martin Hannett and seeking a new recording contract for a year. To tie in with their final gig, a second album, Once Upon A Time The End, was issued in 2005, on CD only."	Band

The Eastern Union Railway (EUR) was an early English railway, initially sanctioned by Act of Parliament on 19 July 1844, with authorised capital of £200,000 to build a railway from Ipswich to Colchester. Further Acts of 21 July 1845 and 26 June 1846 authorised further increases in capital of £50,000 and £20,000 respectively. The latter Act also specified the options for connection with the pre-existing Eastern Counties Railway (ECR) at Colchester, including effectively 'buying out' the ECR's unexercised rights immediately east of that station. One of the main protagonists was John Chevallier Cobbold and the engineer was Peter Bruff.	PublicTransitSystem
Jakobshavn Glacier, also known as Sermeq Kujalleq (in Greenlandic) and the Jakobshavn Isbræ (in Danish), is a large outlet glacier in West Greenland. It is located near the Greenlandic town of Ilulissat (Danish: Jakobshavn) and ends at the sea in the Ilulissat Icefjord. Jakobshavn Glacier drains 6.5% of the Greenland ice sheet and produces around 10% of all Greenland icebergs. Some 35 billion tonnes of icebergs calve off and pass out of the fjord every year. Icebergs breaking from the glacier are often so large (up to a kilometer in height) that they are too tall to float down the fjord and lie stuck on the bottom of its shallower areas, sometimes for years, until they are broken up by the force of the glacier and icebergs further up the fjord. Studied for over 250 years, Jakobshavn Glacier has helped develop our understanding of climate change and icecap glaciology. Ilulissat Icefjord (Greenlandic: Ilulissat Kangerlua) was declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2004.	Glacier
"Da Bomb was the second studio album by the hip-hop duo Kris Kross, released a year after their first album Totally Krossed Out. The group tried a hardcore/gangsta look to fit with the new style of hip-hop. The album was not as successful as Totally Krossed Out, as many fans were not impressed with the new look and style and the use of the racial slur \""nigga\"" (though they had used it on their first album) and reviews were mixed. The line \""I drop bombs like Hiroshima\"" from \""Da Bomb\"" was edited out of the album's Japanese release. Despite some negative reviews the album was certified platinum in the US, selling 1.1 million copies, and a total of 4 million copies worldwide. Three singles were released, \""Alright\"", \""I'm Real\"" and \""Da Bomb\""."	Album
The 37th Dogras were an infantry regiment of the British Indian Army. They could trace their origins to 1887, when they were raised as the 37th (Dogra) Bengal Infantry. The regiment took part in the Chitral Expedition in 1895 and World War I. During World War I the regiment was in the 14th Indian Division and took part in the Second Battle of Kut and the Capture of Baghdad during the Mesopotamia Campaign. After World War I the Indian government reformed the army moving from single battalion infantry regiments to multi-battalion regiments. In 1922, the 37th Dogras became the 1st Battalion (Prince of Wales's Own) 17th Dogra Regiment. The regiment was allocated to the new Indian Army on independence.	MilitaryUnit

"Valenciennea is a genus of small, bottom-dwelling fish in the family Gobiidae. They are found over sandy bottoms, often at coral reefs in the Indo-Pacific. The members of the genus tend to rest directly on the substrate for extended periods of time. While this is a common behavior for members of the family, this genus also float motionless directly above the substrate, which is why they are sometimes called glider gobies. Their resting behavior has resulted in the vernacular name \""sleeper gobies\"", which invites confusion with the related family Eleotridae. The members of this genus are known to be carnivorous sand-sifters; to eat, they simply engulf entire mouthfuls of sand which they expel through their gills. Specialized structures in their gills filter small crustaceans and worms as the sand is expelled. It is this specific trait that makes some members of the genus attractive to the marine aquarist, and they are often introduced into a marine aquarium for sand-sifting. Some of the species are known to be monogamous. The genus was named after notable French zoologist Achille Valenciennes. These fish are difficult to keep in a tank. Tanks with plenty of live sand and live rock are recommended. Offer foods such as sinking shrimp pellets. Fish may die even if eating properly."	Fish
"Blessed Eurosia Fabris (September 27, 1866 – January 8, 1932), also known as Mamma Rosa, was best known to Catholics as a model of holiness in the daily life of a Catholic family. She gained some attention outside of the Catholic community in 2005 when the Vatican started her on the process of canonization. Some people have quipped that she might even become the \""patron saint of large families\"" because she had eleven children (two were adopted)."	Saint

Harvey v. United States, 113 U.S. 243 (1885), was a case for labor and materials furnished by the claimants in constructing coffer dams and in performing the work necessarily connected therewith and preliminary to the mason work for the piers and abutments referred to in the contract. That court proceeded on the view that the claimants had no right to rely on the testimony of experts introduced by them as to the value of the work, but should have kept and produced accounts of its cost and expense, but it gave to the claimants the benefit of the testimony of experts introduced by the United States as to such value in awarding the above amount. Held that the claimants could not be deprived of reasonable compensation for their work because they did not produce evidence of the character referred to, when it did not appear that such evidence existed, if the evidence they produced was the best evidence accessible to them and it enabled the court to arrive at a proper conclusion. The judgment of the Court of Claims is affirmed for the full amount of the award made to the claimants, and an additional amount of,842.82 is allowed for the labor done and materials furnished by the claimants in constructing coffer dams and in performing the work necessarily connected therewith and preliminary to the mason work for the piers and abutments referred to in their contract, the same being an additional allowance on account of item (1) in their petition filed August 30, 1876, and the said judgment is reversed so far as respects item (2) in that petition, and the sum of,574.80 is allowed for that item, and this cause was remanded to the Court of Claims, with a direction to enter judgment accordingly.

Southern hip hop, also known as Southern rap, South Coast hip hop, or Dirty South, is a blanket term for a subgenre of American hip hop music that emerged in the Southern United States, especially in Atlanta, New Orleans, Houston, Memphis, and Miami. The music was a reaction to the 1980s flow of hip hop culture from New York City and the Los Angeles area, and can be considered a third major American hip hop genre, after East Coast hip hop and West Coast hip hop. Many early Southern rap artists released their music independently or on mixtapes after encountering difficulty securing record-label contracts in the 1990s. By the early 2000s, many Southern artists had attained national success, and as the decade went on, both mainstream and underground varieties of Southern hip-hop became among the most popular and influential of the entire genre.

"A French legislative election took place on 25 May and 1 June 1997 to elect the 11th National Assembly of the Fifth Republic. It was the consequence of President Jacques Chirac's decision to call the legislative election one year before the deadline. In March 1993, the right won a large victory in the legislative election and a comfortable parliamentary majority. Two years later, the RPR leader Jacques Chirac was elected President of France promising to reduce the \""social fracture\"". However, the programme of welfare reforms (\""Plan Juppé\"") proposed by his Prime Minister Alain Juppé caused a social crisis in November and December 1995. The popularity of the executive duo decreased. In spring 1997, President Chirac tried to take the left-wing opposition by surprise by dissolving the National Assembly. The first opinion polls indicated a re-election of the right-wing majority. The \""Plural Left\"" coalition, composed of the Socialists, the Communists, the Greens, the Citizens' Movement and the Left Radicals, proposed a program of social reforms to reduce unemployment, limiting the length of the work week to 35 hours. Prime Minister Juppé's unpopularity may have made the left's win easier. In the first round, the left-wing coalition obtained more votes than the incumbent parliamentary majority. After he was blamed for the situation, Juppé announced he would resign even if the right kept their majority in the runoff vote. For all that, the \""Plural left\"" obtained the majority of the seats. However the Socialist Party needed its allies to form a majority. For the first time, the ecologists were represented in the Parliament. The participation of the National Front's candidates in the second round increased the defeat of the \""Presidential majority\"". This was the first time since 1877 that a President of France lost a legislative election which he had called. The Socialist leader Lionel Jospin became Prime Minister of the third \""cohabitation\"". It finished with the 2002 French presidential election."	Election
Braxton Bragg Comer (November 7, 1848 – August 15, 1927) was a planter, businessman, slave owner, and an American Democratic politician who was the 33rd Governor of Alabama from 1907 to 1911, and a United States Senator in 1920. As governor, he achieved railroad reform, lowering rates for businesses in Alabama to make them more competitive with other states. He increased funding for the public school system, resulting in more rural schools and high schools in each county for white students, and eventually a rise in the state's literacy rate. In addition to interests in the Comer family's 30,000-acre (120 km2) plantation, devoted to corn and cotton production, he had an interest in the Comer mines near Birmingham known as the Eureka Mines. In 1897 he invested $10,000 with the Trainer family, who intended to develop textile mills in the state, and he was appointed president of Avondale Mills, which he developed in Birmingham, serving in that role until his death in 1927.

Fred Warren Waters (February 2, 1927 – August 28, 1989) was an American professional baseball player, manager, scout and coach. The left-handed pitcher appeared in 25 Major League games for the 1955–1956 Pittsburgh Pirates. Born in Benton, Mississippi, Waters attended the University of Southern Mississippi. He stood 5 feet 11 inches (1.80 m) tall and weighed 185 pounds (84 kg). Apart from his trials with the Pirates, Waters had a 13-season (1949–58; 1960–62) pitching career in minor league baseball. He was first signed by the Brooklyn Dodgers, then acquired by the Milwaukee Braves in April 1953, spending most of that season with the Lincoln Chiefs of the Class A Western League. Then, on December 26, 1953, he was traded to Pittsburgh along with third baseman Sid Gordon, outfielder Sam Jethroe, pitcher Max Surkont, fellow minor leaguers Curt Raydon and Larry Lasalle, and $100,000 for third baseman Danny O'Connell. This is the only six-for-one trade in Major League history and was surpassed only by the seven-for-one deal that sent Vida Blue from the Oakland Athletics to the San Francisco Giants in 1978. Waters appeared in two games in relief for the Pirates at the end of the 1955 season, then worked in 23 games for the Pirates over the last three months of 1956 after his recall from the Open-Classification Hollywood Stars of the Pacific Coast League. Both of his MLB victories came in starting roles. His first big-league triumph came on July 26, when he went seven shutout innings against the Chicago Cubs, allowing only four singles and three bases on balls. Howie Pollet relieved Waters in the eighth inning with two runners on base, and preserved the 4–0 shutout win. Over his 25 Major League games and 56 innings pitched, Waters allowed 55 hits and compiled a strong 2.89 career earned run average. However, he issued 32 bases on balls, with only 14 strikeouts. Waters appeared in only seven minor league games in 1958 and sat out the 1959 season completely. He became a high school baseball coach in Pensacola, Florida. But in 1960, at age 33, he returned to baseball as a pitcher-coach for the Class D Pensacola Angels of the Alabama–Florida League. In three seasons with Pensacola's professional franchise, he appeared in 73 games, largely as a starting pitcher, and compiled a 41–13 record and a sparkling 2.04 earned run average. In 1964, Waters became a manager and coach in the farm system of the Minnesota Twins, while continuing his high school coaching duties in Pensacola. During Waters' 22 seasons as a manager, all of them in short-season leagues (Rookie and Short Season-A levels), his teams went 681–664 (.505). Waters retired from managing after the 1986 season, and died in Pensacola three years later at the age of 62.	BaseballPlayer

"Diamonds and Nuggets is a compilation album by heavy metal band Saxon released in 2000. This compilation consists of rare and unreleased tracks recorded during the early days of Saxon. Although there are extensive liner notes from Graham Oliver and Steve Dawson for each track in the booklet of the CD, sometimes it isn't easy to classify the tracks chronologically. \""Walking\"" is - considering the chronology - the first recorded track on this compilation. It was recorded by Graham Oliver and Steve Dawson in 1972, so it might be a recording of the band Blue Condition. The tracks, which are following chronologically, are those from the Tapestry Sessions in early 1976, shortly after the band changed its name from S.O.B. to Son Of A Bitch. These songs are \""Still Fit to Rock 'n' Roll\"", the early title of \""Still Fit to Boogie\"", \""Ain't You Glad to Be Alive\"" and the first version of \""Freeway Mad\"" (printed as \""Freeway Mad (Part 1)\"" in the booklet and misprinted as \""Freeway Mad (Part 2)\"" on the inlay). Then there are the tracks from the Luxemburg sessions in 1978, still recorded under the moniker of Son Of A Bitch. These tracks are \""See the Light Shining\"", \""Stand up and Be Counted\"", the second version of \""Freeway Mad\"" (printed as \""Freeway Mad (Part 2)\"" in the booklet and on the inlay), \""Ann Marie\"", \""Lift up Your Eyes\"" and \""Street Fighting Gang\"" (misprinted as \""Street Fighting Man\"" in the booklet and on the inlay). You can also find some tracks on the CD, which are from the period, when the band already changed its to Saxon. Those are the three live tracks \""Stallions of the Highway\"", \""Midnight Rider\"" and \""Frozen Rainbow\"" with Nigel Glockler on drums, the \""Stone Room Jam\"", which was recorded during the mixing of the live album The Eagle Has Landed in 1982 and the Power and the Glory-outtakes \""Turn out the Lights\"", \""Coming to the Rescue\"" and \""Make 'em Rock\"". The studio version of \""Frozen Rainbow\"" with Rod Argent on keyboards and the original version of \""Big teaser\"" cannot be classified chronologically, but they seem to be recorded, when Saxon still was called Son Of A Bitch. The live version of \""Frozen Rainbow\"" is the same, which is released as bonus track on the remastered edition of The Eagle Has Landed, but with a better mix."	Album

Kurz and Allison were a major publisher of chromolithographs in the late 19th century. Based at 267-269 Wabash Avenue in Chicago, they built their reputation on large prints published in the mid-1880s depicting battles of the American Civil War. This was a period of recollection among veterans, and the company was trying to capitalise of this sentiment. In all, a set of thirty-six battle scenes were published from designs by Louis Kurz (1835–1921), himself a veteran of the war. Kurz, a native of Salzburg, Austria, had emigrated to the United States in 1848. While the prints were highly inaccurate and considered naive fantasies like Currier and Ives prints, they were still sought after. They did not pretend to mirror the actual events but rather attempted to tap people's patriotic emotions. When the Spanish–American War broke out in 1898, the company created several large prints of the major battles and of the subsequent campaign of the Philippine–American War. Later conflicts such as the Russo-Japanese War were also illustrated by the company.	Publisher

SimTower: The Vertical Empire (known as The Tower (ザ・タワー Za Tawā) in Japan) is a construction and management simulation video game developed by OpenBook Co., Ltd. and published by Maxis for the Microsoft Windows and Macintosh System 7 operating systems in November 1994. In Japan, it was published by OpenBook that same year and was later released for the Sega Saturn and Sony PlayStation in 1996. The game allows players to build and manage a tower and decide what facilities to place in it, in order to ultimately build a five-star tower. Random events take place during play, such as terrorist acts that the player must respond to immediately. Critical reception towards the game was generally positive. Reviews praised the game's formula, including its open-ended nature and its ability to immerse the player into the game. Criticism targeted the game's lack of documentation, which some reviewers found made it harder to learn how to play the game. The in-game speed was also criticized for being too slow, which was a crucial issue in the game because time must pass for the player to earn income to purchase new facilities.	VideoGame

The Baba Mountain range (Pashto: بابا غر‎ Bâbâ Ǧar; Persian: کوه بابا‎‎ Koh-e Bâbâ) is the western extension of the Hindu Kush, and the origin of Afghanistan's Kabul, Helmand, Arghandab and the Hari River. The mountain range is crowned by Foladi peak (Shah Fuladi, 34°38′43″N 67°37′27″E﻿ / ﻿34.64528°N 67.62417°E) rising 4951 m; 16,244 ft. above sea level, and is located south of Bamyan, Afghanistan. The Koh-i-Firoz plateau merges farther to the west by gentle gradients into the Paropamise, and which may be traced across the Hari River to Mashad. To the southwest of the culminating peaks, long spurs divide the upper tributaries of the Helmand, and separate its basin from that of the Farah River. These spurs retain a considerable altitude, for they are marked by peaks exceeding 11,000 ft (3,400 m). They sweep in a broad band of roughly parallel ranges to the southwest, preserving their general direction till they abut on the Great Registan desert to the west of Kandahar, where they terminate in a series of detached and broken anticlinals whose sides are swept by a sea of encroaching sand. The long, straight, level-backed ridges which divide the Argandab, the Tarnak and Arghastan valleys, and flank the route from Kandahar to Ghazni. The high jagged peaks above the Hajigak Pass, blue-black and shining, shimmer in the sunlight for they contain an estimated reserve of 2 billion tons of iron ore; Asia's richest deposit. The very steep descent from the Hajigak Pass (3,700 m (12,100 ft)) with its numerous hairpin bends leads to the sparkling Kalu River, known locally as the Sauzao or Green Waters. It is bordered by poplars and several charming villages. There is a mining camp high above the road at the bottom of the pass and almost any black stone picked from the side of the road in its vicinity will impress you with its weight. Piles of neatly stacked rock cleared from the fields impress one with the industry of these Afghan farmers. In the fall one may also see the ladies weaving in open fields beside their houses. The Hajigak Pass with its natural beauty remains rugged and unpaved despite being the transit way into almost whole central Afghanistan. The pass and its surrounding territories remain snow-covered through most part of the year, during which the traffic shifts to Shibar Pass. The area is inhabited mostly by ethnic Hazara people followed by Tajiks, Pashtuns. Much of the population heavily depends on agriculture as their prime source of income and potato the prime crop.

"The Lockport Cave can refer to one of two caverns beneath the city of Lockport, New York. One of the caves formed naturally in the underlying dolomite and limestone bedrocks, whereas the other is a hydraulic raceway constructed in the nineteenth century. Historical and recent accounts of attempted exploration of the natural cave system exist, although the cave has been sealed since 1889. The true size of the cave remains a mystery, though it is speculated to have an area of several square miles.The Lockport Cave Company was formed in 1883 to explore and remove mud from the cave, however little progress was made because of inadequate funding and frequent flooding. The man-made hydraulic raceway, often called \""The Lockport Caves\"" by locals, was constructed between 1858 and 1900. The raceway supplied water to local industries for decades, and now contains a tourist attraction, the Lockport Cave and Underground Boat Ride."	Cave

Donald Vivian Bennett (May 9, 1915 – November 28, 2005) retired as a four-star general from the United States Army in 1974. He attended Michigan State University for two years, but then left to attend, and graduate from, the United States Military Academy in 1940. Bennett then served overseas in World War II in North Africa, Sicily, and in the invasion of the European continent. Bennett received the Distinguished Service Cross as well as two Purple Hearts for his service. He was born in Lakeside, Ohio and retired to Asheville, North Carolina. He entered military service from Ohio. On 6 June 1944, Lieutenant Colonel Bennett, along with the 62nd Armored Field Artillery Battalion which he commanded, landed with the second wave at 0720 on D-Day. His party was subjected to a tremendous volume of machine gun fire which inflicted 50 percent casualties before they reached the comparative safety of the shingle at the base of the cliff adjoining the beach. Observing that following units were pinned down on the beach, he immediately left his cover and moved about the beach under heavy fire in order to assemble and reorganize the infantry assault companies, four tanks, and an antiaircraft unit. By redistributing the remaining officers and equipment; by emplacing the .50 caliber machine guns of the antiaircraft unit so as to give close support to the infantry; and by radioing for tank and artillery fire support from the LCTs, he organized a sizable force and, at about 1000 hours, successfully assaulted the ridge. He then continued moving about the beach under intense fire and succeeded in locating a protected place to bring his battalion and move it across the beach. Lieutenant Colonel Bennett, in disregarding his own safety under such heavy enemy fire throughout the day and in his clear thinking, contributed immeasurably to the establishment of the beachhead. General Bennett recounts his World War II experience in his memoir, Honor Untarnished, published by Tom Doherty Associates, LLC in 2003. General Bennett also served as superintendent of the United States Military Academy from 1966 to 1969. He was Commander of VII US Corps from June 1968 until September 1969, and Commander of U.S. Forces Korea from September 1972 until July 1973. He retired in 1974 as commanding general of the U.S. Army Pacific Command. Bennett died on November 28, 2005 at the age of 90 and was buried at the United States Military Academy Cemetery in West Point, New York.	MilitaryPerson

Monponsett Pond, also called Monponsett Lake and the Twin Lakes, is actually a system of two ponds, West and East, mostly in Halifax, Massachusetts, with a small portion of West Monponsett Pond extending into Hanson. The western basin is 282 acres (1.14 km2), and the eastern basin is 246 acres (1.00 km2). The average depth of both ponds is seven feet and the maximum depth is 13 feet (4.0 m). The outflow is Stump Brook, a tributary of Poor Meadow Brook, in the northwestern part of West Monponsett Pond. The pond is part of the Taunton River Watershed. Occasionally during water shortages water from this pond is diverted into Silver Lake, the principal water supply for the City of Brockton. Route 58 bisects the two ponds. A paved boat launching ramp to West Monponsett Pond is on this highway north of White Island Road. A culvert connecting the two ponds is nearby. Route 106 runs close to the southern shore of East Monponsett Pond, and Route 36 abuts the southeast corner of East Monponsett Pond, where there is a paved launching ramp. Access to West Monponsett Pond is an unpaved ramp off Lingan Street. Monponsett Pond Seaplane Base is located on this pond.	Lake

The United Kingdom general election of 1992 was held on 9 April 1992, and was the fourth consecutive victory for the Conservative Party. It was the last outright win for the Conservatives until 2015. This election result took many by surprise, as opinion polling leading up to the election day had shown the Labour Party, under leader Neil Kinnock, consistently, if narrowly, ahead. John Major had won the leadership election in November 1990 following the resignation of Margaret Thatcher. During his term leading up to the 1992 election he oversaw the British involvement in the Gulf War, introduced legislation to replace the unpopular Community Charge with Council Tax, and signed the Maastricht treaty. The economy was facing a recession around the time of Major's appointment, along with most of the other industrialised nations. Because it confounded the opinion polls, the 1992 election was one of the most dramatic elections in the UK since the end of the Second World War. The BBC's live television broadcast of the election results was presented by David Dimbleby and Peter Snow, with John Cole. On ITV, the ITN-produced coverage was presented by Jon Snow, Alastair Stewart, and Julia Somerville, with Sir Robin Day performing the same interviewing role for ITV as he had done for the BBC on many previous election nights. Sky News presented full coverage of a general election night for the first time. Their coverage was presented by David Frost, Michael Wilson, Selina Scott, Adam Boulton and political scientist Michael Thrasher, with former BBC political journalist Donald MacCormick presenting analysis of the Scottish vote. The Conservatives received what remains the largest number of votes in British history, breaking the record set by Labour in 1951.	Election

Puccinia pittieriana (syn. Gerwasia pittieriana) is a species of rust fungus. It is a plant pathogen which infects agricultural crops such as potato and tomato. Its common names include common potato rust and common potato and tomato rust. This fungus was first made known to science in 1904 when it was collected from potatoes in cultivation on the slopes of Irazú Volcano in Costa Rica. It was later found on wild potato species such as Solanum demissum and on tomato crops. It is now known from Central and South America and from Mexico. Its known hosts now include many wild and cultivated species of Solanum. This is the only rust fungus that infects tomatoes. Fungal infection manifests as greenish white spots a few millimeters wide on the undersides of a plant's leaves. The upper surfaces of the leaves may be dimpled as the lesions penetrate the blades. The lesions turn whitish with red to brown centers. The lesions spread across the leaf, which then dies and falls. Lesions can also form on the petioles, stems, flowers, and fruits. The fungal spores are borne on the wind and infect plants when the plant surface is moist and the average temperature is around 10°C. Symptoms appear in about two weeks and the lesions are largest by 20 to 25 days after infection by spores. Several potato cultivars are resistant to the rust.	Fungus

Lake Galilee is a semi-arid saline lake located in the Desert Uplands region of Central West Queensland. The lake is about 36 kilometres long, up to 12.5 kilometres wide and covers approximately 25,700 hectares. Lake Galilee is registered on the Directory of Important Wetlands in Australia (DIWA) and provides an important refuge and breeding site for waterbirds. It has been identified by BirdLife International as an Important Bird Area (IBA) because it regularly supports over 1% of the world populations of freckled ducks and grey teals. and possibly more than 1% of the world population of other waterbirds and shorebirds. The weed Parkinsonia is posing as an environmental threat to the lake as are feral animals, grazing impacts and tourism pressures. The group of property owners adjacent to the lake are working with local natural resource management groups (Desert Uplands Committee and Desert Channels Queensland) to manage these threats.	Lake

"Alexander Augustus Norman Dudley \""Jerry\"" Pentland, MC, DFC, AFC (5 August 1894 – 3 November 1983) was an Australian fighter ace in World War I. Born in Maitland, New South Wales, he commenced service as a Lighthorseman with the Australian Imperial Force in 1915, and saw action at Gallipoli. He transferred to the Royal Flying Corps the following year, rising to captain. Credited with twenty-three aerial victories, Pentland became the fifth highest-scoring Australian ace of the war, after Robert Little, Stan Dallas, Harry Cobby and Roy King. He was awarded the Military Cross in January 1918 for \""conspicuous gallantry and devotion to duty\"" on a mission attacking an aerodrome behind enemy lines, and the Distinguished Flying Cross that August for engaging four hostile aircraft single-handedly. Pentland served in the fledgling Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF), and later the Royal Air Force, before going into business in 1927. His ventures included commercial flying around the goldfields of New Guinea, aircraft design and manufacture, flight instruction, and charter work. In the early 1930s, he was employed as a pilot with Australian National Airways, and also spent time as a dairy farmer.

He also worked as a ministerial consultant. He was elected to the House of Representatives seat of Adelaide at the 1990 election, narrowly defeating Liberal incumbent Mike Pratt. A redistribution ahead of the 1993 election pushed his seat to the south, adding Liberal-friendly territory south of the city centre, cutting his margin from an already slender 3.7 percent to an extremely marginal 1.7 percent. It did not help matters that voters were angry at the state Labor government over the collapse of the State Bank of South Australia, These factors led to his defeat by Liberal challenger Trish Worth at the 1993 election. Professor Catley was Head of the University of Newcastle's Central Coast School of Business at its Ourimbah Campus. He has now retired."	MemberOfParliament

As a two year old in 1984 Nihilator won his first twelve races before finishing second behind Dragon's Lair in the Breeders Crown. His winning streak included a win in the Woodrow Wilson Pace, a race that was the richest run for either the Thoroughbred or Standardbred breed at the time. His winning time of 1:52 4/5 was a world record for a two year old pacer. He was the 2-Year Old Colt Pacer of the Year for 1984.

Frank Edward McKinney, Jr. (November 3, 1938 – September 11, 1992) was an American competition swimmer, Olympic champion, and former world record-holder. He later became a prominent executive in the American banking industry, but died in a mid-air collision of two aircraft. McKinney was the son of Frank E. McKinney, a former chairman of the Democratic National Committee and a former owner of the National League's Pittsburgh Pirates. He was the youngest member of a U.S. national swim team that set a world record in the 4×100-meter medley relay at the 1955 Pan American Games. At the Pan American Games, the 16-year-old high school student also won a gold medal in the 100-meter backstroke. Born in Indianapolis, Indiana, he did the most to introduce modern backstroke techniques. Following Yoshi Oyakawa as the premier U.S. backstroker, McKinney was the pioneer of the modern bent-arm backstrokers, even as Oyakawa had been the last of the straight-arm school. McKinney was the leader of a remarkable group of teenagers who won the U.S. Nationals for the Indianapolis Athletic Club alongside Mike Troy, Bill Barton, Bill Cass and Alan Somers. Later, they would all swim for the Indiana Hoosiers swimming and diving team under coach Doc Counsilman at Indiana University. McKinney captured a bronze medal in the men's 100-meter backstroke at the 1956 Summer Olympics in Melbourne, Australia, and then entered Indiana University. At the 1960 Summer Olympics in Rome, Italy, he received a silver medal for his second-place finish in the men's 100-meter backstroke. He also won a gold medal by swimming the lead-off backstroke leg for the first-place U.S. team in the men's 4×100-meter medley relay. McKinney retired from competition after graduating from Indiana University in 1961, and went into banking. He was the president of Bank One of Indiana (previously American Fletcher National Bank), headquartered in Indianapolis when he died, aged 53, in a mid-air collision between two aircraft in 1992. As part of the merger, he also became president of the Columbus, Ohio-based parent company, Banc One Corporation, while still serving as the chief executive officer of the Indiana subsidiary. McKinney was traveling to Columbus, Ohio with 3 other civic leaders, who were also killed along with the pilots of both aircraft. He is buried in Crown Hill Cemetery in Indianapolis.	Swimmer

Lucien Tesnière (French: [lysjɛ̃ tɛnjɛʁ]; May 13, 1893 – December 6, 1954) was a prominent and influential French linguist. He was born in Mont-Saint-Aignan on May 13, 1893. As a professor in Strasbourg (1924), and later in Montpellier (1937), he published many papers and books on Slavic languages. However, his importance in the history of linguistics is based mainly on his development of an approach to the syntax of natural languages that would become known as dependency grammar. He presented his theory in his book Éléments de syntaxe structurale (Elements of Structural Syntax), published posthumously in 1959. In the book he proposes a sophisticated formalization of syntactic structures, supported by many examples from a diversity of languages. Tesnière died in Montpellier on December 6, 1954. Many central concepts that the modern study of syntax takes for granted were developed and presented in Tesnière's book (i.e. in the Éléments). For instance, Tesnière developed the concept of valency in detail, and the primary distinction between arguments (actants) and adjuncts (circumstants, French circonstants), which most if not all theories of syntax now acknowledge and build on, was central to Tesnière's understanding. Tesnière also argued vehemently that syntax is autonomous from morphology and semantics. This stance is similar to generative grammar, which takes syntax to be a separate component of the human faculty for language.	Philosopher

As the nephew of Martin Ruzé de Beaulieu (died in 1613), who was the Secretary of State of the Maison du Roi under three kings of France, he came to court quite quickly. Due to Louis XIII's sympathy for Beaulieu, he easily gained the king's favour. By 1616, he was already First Gentleman of the king's stable. When Charles de La Vieuville was Superintendent of Finances, he was his assistant. When Cardinal Richelieu entered the King's Council in 1624, Effiat quickly became someone the Cardinal could trust. Thanks to the pleadings of the cardinal, Effiat entered the council the same year and was appointed ambassador extraordinary to England and tasked with negotiating the marriage of the Prince of Wales (later Charles I) with the sister of the king of France's, Henrietta Maria of France. After Michel Marillac's transfer from Superintendent of Finances to Keeper of the Seals, the job of superintendent was offered to Effiat, due to the Richelieu's trust in him. Following a treaty with Lorraine, Effiat was sent with an army to secure the fortresses of Clermont-en-Argonne, Stenay, and Jamets, along with towns placed under Louis XIII's protection by the elector of Trier. He is perhaps known best as the father of Henri Coiffier de Ruzé, Marquis of Cinq-Mars, Louis XIII's male favourite.	Noble

The Popular Association – Golden Dawn (Greek: Λαϊκός Σύνδεσμος – Χρυσή Αυγή, Laïkós Sýndesmos – Chrysí Avgí), usually known simply as Golden Dawn (Greek: Χρυσή Αυγή, Chrysí Avgí pronounced [xriˈsi avˈʝi]), is a nationalist far-right political party in Greece. It is led by Nikolaos Michaloliakos. Scholars and media have described it as neo-Nazi and fascist, though the group rejects these labels. Members have expressed admiration of the former Greek dictator Ioannis Metaxas of the 4th of August Regime (1936–1941). They have also made use of alleged Nazi symbolism, and have praised figures of Nazi Germany in the past. According to academic sources, the group is racist and xenophobic, while the party's leader has openly identified it as nationalist and racist. Michaloliakos began the foundations of what would become Golden Dawn in 1980, when he published the first issue of the right-wing, pro-military junta journal with that name. In this context Golden Dawn had its origins in the movement that worked towards a return to right-wing military dictatorship in Greece. Following an investigation into the murder of anti-fascist rapper Pavlos Fyssas in September 2013 by an alleged supporter of the party, Michaloliakos, and several other Golden Dawn MPs and members, were arrested and held in pre-trial detention on suspicion of forming a criminal organization. The trial began on 20 April 2015.	PoliticalParty

After spending 1877 with the Hartford Dark Blues and 1878 with the Chicago White Stockings, he found his next home with the Providence Grays. From 1879 until 1885, when he was 42, Start held down first base for the Grays and continued to hit well. Unfortunately, 1885 was Providence's last season in the NL, so in 1886, he moved to the Washington Nationals for what would be his last season. Start only played 31 games for the Nationals and didn't hit well, even for a 43-year-old. 1878 was probably Start's best season with the bat. He led the league with 100 hits and 125 total bases. He came close to the league lead with his 12 doubles, 5 triples, and a single home run. His 58 runs that year were second in the league. These statistics all came in only 285 at bats, and at the age of 35, long after most players have begun to decline. Start ended his career with 1418 hits, 854 runs, and 544 RBI in National League and National Association play. He had a .299 batting average, a .322 on-base percentage, and a .367 slugging percentage. These numbers ignore the first 11 years of his career and, since they were achieved in much shorter seasons than today's professionals play, they only show a portion of his value to his teams. In addition, his career spanned many important rule changes that changed the game in many ways, but Start continued to play at a high level through all of them. Start's 1879 Providence team won the National League, and in 1884 they won a championship, beating the New York Metropolitans. Start was also regarded as an excellent fielder, although at 5'9\"" he was a much smaller player than would later be typical at his position. Some even say that he originated the modern positioning of the first baseman, being the first to play away from the bag. Just like every other player of his time, Start never fielded with a glove, as modern players do, making his fielding contributions more impressive. Start died in Providence, Rhode Island at the age of 84."	BaseballPlayer

"The Word is an American instrumental/sacred steel/gospel blues jam band. The supergroup includes well-known musicians: Robert Randolph (pedal steel guitar), John Medeski (keyboards), both members of North Mississippi Allstars- Luther Dickinson (electric guitar), Cody Dickinson (drums, washboard), and ex-North Mississippi Allstars bassist Chris Chew. The Word developed from a mutual affection for gospel music and the Sacred Steel tradition shared by Medeski and members of the North Mississippi Allstars, both having discovered the phenomenon through a series of albums published by Arhoolie Records in the 1990s and early 2000s. Chris Chew and Luther Dickinson were particularly fond of a song called \""Without God\"" on the Sacred Steel Live! album, the only track credited to a then-unknown Robert Randolph. They contacted Randolph and recruited him to form their own Sacred Steel band, likely the first initiated by musicians outside the House of God church organization. Musically, The Word is similar to other sacred steel bands, with the major difference being a total lack of vocals, both gospel singing and sing-song preaching that often accompanies such music in the original church setting. The organ and electric piano content, provided by Medeski, is more experimental and pronounced than in traditional sacred steel music, which originally developed from House of God churches filling the role of a pipe organ with the much less expensive steel guitar. Another unusual aspect of the music is that drummer Cody Dickinson plays electric washboard on certain songs, as he sometimes does with the North Mississippi Allstars. During live concerts, there is typically only one vocal microphone, used by Randolph to address the audience with encouragement and occasional exclamations of spiritual praise between songs. However, there is at least one example of bassist Chris Chew singing the lyrics to a traditional gospel song played by The Word, on January 1, 2010 in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. Their debut self-titled album, produced by Medeski and released on Ropeadope Records July 31, 2001, includes an updated version of \""Without God\"", the song that brought The Word together in the first place. The album contains a mixture of traditional gospel songs (played with instrumental arrangements) and original instrumentals written by the group. The group toured in 2002 and then reunited to tour again in late 2007/early 2008. The group also played at the Bonnaroo festival in 2005 and 2012, and on the Jam Cruise in 2010. The group performed live on Conan on May 11, 2015 and toured the United States that summer and fall."	Band

Teleosaurus was an extinct genus of teleosaurid crocodyliform that lived during the Middle Jurassic. It was approximately 3 metres (10 ft) in length. Teleosaurus had highly elongate jaws, similar to those of a modern gharial. It had a long, slender, body, with a sinuous tail that would have helped propel it through the water. Its forelimbs were remarkably short, and would probably have been held close to the body when swimming to improve the animal's streamlining. Unlike modern crocodilians, it lived in the open ocean, and it probably caught fish and squid with its sharp, needle-like teeth.	Reptile

"Edgar Eddie Lacy (August 2, 1944 – March 22, 2011) was an American basketball player who won two NCAA championships at UCLA, then played one season in the American Basketball Association with the Los Angeles Stars. In public printed media, his last name was generally rendered as Lacey. However, at the time he signed his professional contract, he indicated the correct spelling had always been Lacy. Lacy was a highly decorated player at Jefferson High School in Los Angeles. He was twice named a high school All-American by Parade Magazine and was Los Angeles city player of the year as a senior in 1963. Lacy chose to attend hometown UCLA and play for future Hall of Fame coach John Wooden. In his sophomore season, he was a starter on the Bruins' 1964–65 championship team. After a strong junior season, Lacy redshirted what would have been his senior year with a broken leg in 1966–67 as the Bruins won their third championship. In 1967–68, Lacy opted to return and was again a starter for the Bruins. However, in a highly anticipated match-up between the Bruins and the Houston Cougars—a contest dubbed the \""Game of the Century\"" by the media—Lacy was benched by Wooden after 11 minutes and never re-entered the game. Upset with Wooden's public comments implying that he did not want back into the game, Lacy quit the team, missing what would be another UCLA championship run. \""I've never enjoyed playing for that man,\"" Lacy said of Wooden after quitting. In 2008, Wooden stated, \""I'm sorry I said that. It hurt him, and that's why he quit. I was very disappointed. Edgar was a fine boy.\"" Lacy was drafted by the San Francisco Warriors in the fourth round of the 1968 NBA Draft (he had also been drafted by the Boston Celtics the previous year). However, he instead played in the ABA for the Los Angeles Stars. Lacy played one season for the Stars, averaging 5.1 points and 3.9 rebounds in 46 games. Prior to the next season, he retired from professional basketball, stating his intention to return to college to pursue a law degree. Edgar Lacy died on March 22, 2011. He was survived by his daughter, Celeste Lacy."	BasketballPlayer

The Fish River is a waterway in the U.S. state of Alaska. The 47-mile-long (76 km) river rises in the Bendeleben Mountains and flows south to Golovnin Lagoon, before emptying into Golovnin Bay, Norton Sound, and the Bering Sea. The basin formed by the Fish River is known for its placer gold deposits, and in particular, the Niukluk River and its tributaries; production from this tributary valley is reported to be more than from any other place in the region. A galena mine existed 40 miles (64 km) from the sea, worked on occasion by a San Francisco corporation with a few hundred tons of ore taken to the city for smelting and refining for silver.

Bulweria is a genus of seabirds in the family Procellariidae named after English naturalist James Bulwer. The genus has two extant species, Bulwer's petrel (B. bulwerii) and Jouanin's petrel (B. fallax). A third species, the Olson's petrel (Bulweria bifax), became extinct in the early 16th century; it is known only from skeletal remains. Bulwer's Petrel ranges in the Atlantic, Indian and Pacific Oceans, whereas Joaunin's Petrel is confined to the northwestern Indian Ocean. Olson's Petrel is known from the Atlantic. Bulweria petrels have long been considered related to the gadfly petrels in the genus Pterodroma, but recent mtDNA cytochrome b sequence analysis has proven them to be closely related to the shearwaters in the genus Puffinus and especially the Procellaria petrels.

"The Buenos Aires Western Railway (in Spanish: Ferrocarril Oeste de Buenos Aires), inaugurated in the city of Buenos Aires on 29 August 1857, was the first railway built in Argentina and the start of the extensive rail network which was developed over the following years. The locomotive La Porteña, built by the British firm E.B.Wilson and Company in Leeds, was the first train to travel on this line. The route initially measured 10 km, stretching from Del Parque station (now the site of the Teatro Colón) to Floresta station, which at that time was located in San José de Flores village, but is now within Buenos Aires city limits. The rails were laid along what are now Lavalle, Enrique S. Discépolo, Avenida Corrientes and Avenida Pueyrredón, and then followed the route of the current Domingo Sarmiento Railway line towards Floresta. Although the construction of this line was proposed by a group of private individuals known as the \""Sociedad del Camino-Ferrocarril al Oeste\"" (in English: \""Western Railway Society\""), it was financed by the province of Buenos Aires, which was at that time an independent state of the Argentine Confederation. In 1863 the province became sole owner of the railway line. The Western Railway was one of the greatest triumphs of Buenos Aires state, which justified its 27 years of ownership of the railway based on the wealth it brought to the city, its efficiency and its lower fares than those of the British-owned railway companies operating in the country. Pressure from British capital and the debts owed by the state of Argentina led to its sale in 1890 to the British company \""Buenos Aires Western Railway\"". The BAWR network is currently part of Domingo Sarmiento Railway network."	RailwayLine

John Philip Tsitouris (May 4, 1936 – October 22, 2015) was an American professional baseball player who pitched in the Major Leagues from 1957–60 and 1962–68. He threw and batted right-handed, stood 6 feet (1.8 m) tall and weighed 175 pounds (79 kg). Tsitouris graduated from Benton Heights High School in Monroe, North Carolina. He signed with the Detroit Tigers as an amateur free agent in 1954 and made his MLB debut with the Tigers on June 13, 1957. Coming into a scoreless tie in relief of Steve Gromek in the fifth inning of a game against the Baltimore Orioles, he had an adventurous top of the sixth frame, surrendering two hits and a stolen base, but emerged unscathed when Oriole baserunners Joe Durham and Dick Williams were both thrown out at home plate. Then, in Detroit's half of the sixth inning, the Tigers scored two runs on a home run by Charlie Maxwell and an RBI double by J. W. Porter. Tsitouris pitched 1 2⁄3 innings that day and gave up one earned run, three hits and two bases on balls, but ended up getting credit for a 2–1 victory. During that offseason, he was part of a 13-player trade that sent, among others, Billy Martin to the Tigers from the Kansas City Athletics. Tsitouris had trials with the Athletics in both 1958 and 1959. He pitched in 14 games and 33 innings pitched in 1960. On May 4th of that year, Tsitouris jaw was broken when he was hit by a line drive in batting practice. After the 1960 season, Tsitouris was traded to the Cincinnati Reds along with John Briggs for left-handed pitcher Joe Nuxhall. He spent almost two full seasons in minor league baseball before getting his chance with Cincinnati in September 1962. Tsitouris made the most of it, giving up only two earned runs in 21⅓ innings and hurling a complete game, five-hit shutout against the Philadelphia Phillies on September 30. For the next three seasons, Tsitouris was a full-time member of the Reds' pitching staff, winning 12 (1963), nine (1964), and six (1965) games, mostly as a starting pitcher. On September 21, 1964, he shut out the Phillies 1–0 on six hits at Connie Mack Stadium, starting the ten-game Philadelphia losing streak that knocked the Phillies out of first place. However, with his effectiveness diminishing year-by-year, Tsitouris was sent to the Triple-A Buffalo Bisons in 1966 and, despite brief trials with Cincinnati in 1967–68, spent the rest of his career in the minors. Tsitouris' Major League record included 149 games pitched, 34 wins, 18 complete games, five shutouts, three saves and 432 strikeouts in 663 innings. He surrendered 653 hits and 260 bases on balls. Tsitouris died in Monroe, North Carolina on October 22, 2015.	BaseballPlayer

He won the bronze medal in the 4000m team pursuit in Berlin with Ernest Mills, Ernest Johnson and Charles King. Born in Padiham, Hill never met his father, who died during World War I in Africa, and he was raised by his mother in Sheffield. Too poor to get to London any other way, Hill cycled the 200 miles using the bike he planned to ride during the Olympic Games. Upon returning to Britain after the Olympics, Hill bicycled 170 miles towards his hometown.

He was to compete at 1939 world track championships but they were cancelled due to World War II. During the conflict, he built submarines in Barrow and, afterwards, ran a garage shop in Radcliffe, Greater Manchester. At 60, he cycled across North America. Hill, a father of five children, claimed never to have smoked or to have drunk alcohol and, until 2004 when he fractured his hip in a fall in Spain, he had biked every day since he was 13. On 23 March 2005 he attended a reception headed by Queen Elizabeth II honouring 100 years of the British Olympic Association. He died of pneumonia on 31 January 2009, at the age of 92.	Cyclist
"Sideling Hill Tunnel is one of three original Pennsylvania Turnpike tunnels abandoned (this one in 1968) after two massive realignment projects. The others are nearby Rays Hill Tunnel, and farther west, the Laurel Hill Tunnel. It was less expensive to realign the Turnpike than to bore a second tube for four lane traffic. Sideling Hill Tunnel is 6,782 feet (2,067 m) long. It was the longest of the original tunnels on the Pennsylvania Turnpike. The Ray's Hill Tunnel and Sideling Hill Tunnel are now part of the Pike2Bike Trail. Together, the two tunnels as well as the roadway are commonly known as the Abandoned Pennsylvania Turnpike. From the Turnpike's opening in 1940 until the realignment projects, the tunnels were bottlenecks; opposing traffic in the same tubes reduced speeds. Four other tunnels on the Turnpike – Allegheny Mountain, Tuscarora Mountain, Kittatinny Mountain, and Blue Mountain – each had a second tube bored, the least expensive option. All of the original tunnels except for the Allegheny Mountain Tunnel were part of \""Vanderbilt's Folly\"", the never-completed South Pennsylvania Railroad."	RoadTunnel

"Piketen (or Piketenheten) is a special operations asset of the Swedish Police Authority, similar to the SWAT in the United States. Piketen is called upon when situations occur that are too dangerous for ordinary police to handle such as hostage situations, serving high-risk arrest warrants and confronting armed criminals. Piketen are stationed in the three largest cities of Sweden: Stockholm, Gothenburg and Malmö but can by request be put to use nationwide all over Sweden. Most police regions in Sweden have their own regional task forces with somewhat similar training and competence to that of Piketen. The main task for Piketen is dangerous situations in dangerous environments, e.g. hostage situations and situations including armed dangerous suspects. Other tasks are riot control, escorting VIP's/objects of value and serving high-risk arrest warrants etc. Piketen has been active since 1979. Its creation was an answer to the events of the Norrmalmstorg robbery in 1973, where robber Jan-Erik \""Janne\"" Olsson took four hostages at Kreditbanken at Norrmalmstorg (\""Norrmalm's Square\"") in Stockholm. Piketen spends about 30% of its time on training, which is mainly focused on high-risk intervention. For example; one or multiple dangerous perpetrators in rural terrain or in an urban environment and perpetrators in houses or vehicles (also including hostage rescue). Such dangerous interventions require a lot of advanced tactical training. The unit strives to resolve any given situation as peacefully as possible to avoid injury or loss of life and uses highly trained negotiators when tactically possible. Circumstances dictate whether piket officers operate in uniform or civilian clothing. Piketen mostly make use of unmarked civilian vehicles or special assault vehicles. Piket officers are well-trained in different methods of entry (MOE), such as rappelling and door breaching. They also receive training in close target reconnaissance, close quarters battle, basic medical care, tactical self-defense, and various weapon systems. Piket officers from Malmö and Gothenburg have been deployed with the EULEX Intervention Group in Kosovo (Special Team Six), tasked with high-risk operations such as hostage rescue and arresting armed criminals."

Scott Wade (born 10 January 1960) is a former Australian rules football player and administrator, most notable for his sixteen year tenure at AFL Tasmania. He played for Hawthorn in the Victorian Football League (VFL) during the early 1980s. Wade, a Tasmanian recruit, spent three seasons at Hawthorn and made two appearances in their premiership year of 1983. A rover, he then returned to his home state and won two William Leitch Medals, firstly with Hobart in 1984 and then for Clarence in 1989. He finished his TFL career with 282 senior games and played in three premiership teams at Clarence as well as one with Hobart. Wade entered football administration in 1997 as general manager of Clarence Wade was promoted to become the general manager of Football Tasmania (later AFL Tasmania) in 1999, and later became CEO. Less than a year into his tenure, he oversaw the collapse of the financially crippled Statewide League, and was involved in establishing the Victorian Football League's Tasmanian Devils Football Club in its place. He was involved in arranging a long-standing deal for Hawthorn to play AFL games in Launceston, and in improving the funding for Tasmanian football from the AFL. He was later involved in the revival of the statewide league in 2009, and in that position oversaw the statewide league's revamp in 2014. Nevertheless, Wade had a negative reputation with many fans, as many of the decisions made by AFL Tasmania during his tenure were unpopular. Two decisions during the Tasmanian Devils tenure in the VFL – the decision to enter a reserves affiliation with North Melbourne and the appointment of coach Daryn Cresswell, whose off-field problems negatively impacted the team – and many of the changes made to TSL club licences in the early 2010s – including the unsuccessful attempt to force a merger between Hobart and North Hobart, and the unsuccessful establishment of the Western Storm – were particularly unpopular with fans.

The Action of 9 July 1806 was a minor engagement between a French privateer frigate and British forces off Southern Ceylon during the Napoleonic Wars. French privateers operating from the Indian Ocean islands of Île Bonaparte and Île de France were a serious threat to British trade across the Indian Ocean during the Wars, and the British deployed numerous methods of intercepting them, including disguising warships as merchant vessels to lure privateers into unequal engagements with more powerful warships. Cruising near the Little Basses Reef on the Southern coast of Ceylon, the 34-gun privateer Bellone was sighted by the 16-gun British brig HMS Rattlesnake, which began chasing the larger French vessel. At 15:15, a third ship was sighted to the south, which proved to be the 74-gun ship of the line HMS Powerful, disguised as an East Indiaman. Although Bellone would normally be much faster than the large British warship, the light winds and Rattlesnake's determined pursuit prevented the privateer from escaping and at 17:00, Powerful was close enough to open fire. Despite the uneven nature of the combat, Bellone unexpectedly resisted the British attack for another hour and 45 minutes, causing more damage to Powerful than she received herself. The privateer was later taken into British service as a sixth rate frigate and prize money was paid for the captured vessels, but the action prompted questions in subsequent histories about the lack of efficiency in British gunnery.

"Ṣadr ad-Dīn Muḥammad Shīrāzī, also called Mulla Sadrā (Persian: ملا صدرا‎‎; also spelled Molla Sadra, Mollasadra or Sadr-ol-Mote'allehin; Arabic: صدرالمتألهین‎‎) (c. 1571/2 – 1640), was an Iranian Shia Islamic philosopher, theologian and ‘Ālim who led the Iranian cultural renaissance in the 17th century. According to Oliver Leaman, Mulla Sadra is arguably the single most important and influential philosopher in the Muslim world in the last four hundred years. Though not its founder, he is considered the master of the Illuminationist (or, Ishraghi or Ishraqi) school of Philosophy, a seminal figure who synthesized the many tracts of the Islamic Golden Age philosophies into what he called the Transcendent Theosophy or al-hikmah al-muta’liyah. Mulla Sadra brought \""a new philosophical insight in dealing with the nature of reality\"" and created \""a major transition from essentialism to existentialism\"" in Islamic philosophy, although his existentialism should not be too readily compared to Western existentialism. His was a question of existentialist cosmology as it pertained to God, and thus differs considerably from the individual, moral, and/or social, questions at the heart of Russian, French, German, or American Existentialism. Mulla Sadra's philosophy ambitiously synthesized Avicennism, Shahab al-Din Suhrawardi's Illuminationist philosophy, Ibn Arabi's Sufi metaphysics, and the theology of the Ash'ari school and Twelvers. His main work is The Transcendent Theosophy in the Four Journeys of the Intellect, or simply Four Journeys."	Philosopher

"Samuel James \""Sam\"" Benson, CBE (12 July 1909 – 26 July 1995) was an Australian politician. Born in Adelaide, he was educated in that city at St Peter's College. He became a wool-classer, then a seaman and Port Phillip pilot, earning the rank of ship's master in 1938. Benson joined the Royal Australian Navy during World War II, and commanded the Bathurst-class corvette HMAS Kiama. Having served as Mayor and Councillor on Williamstown City Council, he was elected to the Australian House of Representatives in 1962 as the Labor member for Batman, filling the vacancy formed by the death of Alan Bird. Benson was re-elected in 1963, but three years later was expelled from the ALP. The expulsion arose from Benson's support of continued Australian participation in the Vietnam War, and, more specifically, his refusal to resign from an organisation called the Defend Australia Committee, after it had been proscribed by the Federal Executive. This organisation comprised a number of Liberal Party, Democratic Labor Party and right-wing activists, and was supported by B.A. Santamaria. Thereafter he served in parliament as an independent. He was re-elected as an independent in 1966, the first person to achieve this feat in the House of Representatives since Lewis Nott in 1949. Benson retired in 1969, and served as the General Secretary of the Merchant Service Guild from 1970 to 1972. He died on 26 July 1995."	MemberOfParliament

Super Cars is a top-view racing game from Gremlin Interactive, who later produced the Lotus series of games. Stylistically, the game is influenced by Super Sprint. There are 9 tracks at each of the 4 difficulty levels, which can be raced in any order (although the last track you race is made harder than usual). In the races you win money, which can be spent on temporary handling and power upgrades, plus armour plating and front/rear shooting missiles that can knock out other racers. The player must finish in the top 3 of each race to progress - initially there are 4 computer opponents, but more are added as you progress through the game. The car can be upgraded throughout the game via the shop section. The player is given an initial price, but also a number of options of things to say to the salesman - with the right combination, the price will drop. It was followed by Super Cars II in 1991.

Henry Percy, 3rd Earl of Northumberland, (25 July 1421 – 29 March 1461) was an English magnate. The Earldom of Northumberland was one of the greatest fifteenth-century landholdings in northern England; Percy also became Lord Poynings on his marriage. This title would bring him into direct conflict with the Poynings family themselves, and indeed, feuds with neighbouring nobles, both lay and ecclesiastical, would be a key occupancy of his youth. Percy married Eleanor Poynings, who outlived him; together they had four children. He was a leading Lancastrian during the Wars of the Roses, from which he managed to personally benefit, although his father died early in the war. He was not, however, to live to enjoy these gains, being killed at the Battle of Towton in 1461 on the defeated Lancastrian side.	Noble

The Pacific Ranges are the southernmost subdivision of the Coast Mountains portion of the Pacific Cordillera. Located entirely within British Columbia, Canada, they run northwest from the lower stretches of the Fraser River to Bella Coola and Burke Channel, north of which are the Kitimat Ranges. The Coast Mountains lie between the Interior Plateau and the Coast of British Columbia. The Pacific Ranges include four of the five major coastal icecaps in the southern Coast Mountains. These are the largest temperate-latitude icecaps in the world and fuel a number of very major rivers (by volume, not length). One of these contains Mount Waddington, the highest summit entirely within British Columbia. Also within this region is Hunlen Falls, among the highest in Canada, located in Tweedsmuir South Provincial Park. Other than logging and various hydroelectric developments, and a large ski resort at Whistler, most of the land in the range is completely undeveloped. Historically, in the southern part of the range, mining was important at various times in the Lillooet, Bridge River and Squamish areas, and large pulp and paper mills at Powell River, Port Mellon and Woodfibre. The largest hydroelectric development in the Pacific Ranges is the Bridge River Power Project, though smaller hydro plants are on the Stave River-Alouette Lake system in Mission and Maple Ridge, the Daisy Lake-Squamish River division of the Cheakamus Powerhouse, and another power dam and power plant at Clowhom. Although the range was extensively surveyed for possible rail routes, only that of the Pacific Great Eastern (now part of CN) was eventually built; the Homathko River-Bute Inlet route, however, was one of the two main choices in the deliberations of the CPR's routing.

Janet Rachael Margaret Morgan (later known by her married name, Janet Shardlow) (1921–1990) was an English squash player who dominated the game in the 1950s. She won the British Open on ten consecutive occasions and was the sport's most famous player until the rise of Heather McKay. Born in Wandsworth, London, Morgan was originally a tennis player who played for Britain in the Wightman Cup in 1946. She quickly turned to squash and in 1948 and 1949 was a losing finalist against Joan Curry. In 1950 she won her first British Open title, beating Curry in the final. She went on to win the trophy for the next ten successive years through to 1959. Before the 1959 British Open Morgan announced that she would retire after the competition due to medical advice because she had suffered from persistent back injuries. Following the tenth victory and retirement she married Roland Horcae “Joe” Bisley later that year in 1959 in London. She became the first chairwoman of the Women's Squash Association soon after and was awarded an MBE in 1961. Following the death of her husband Joe she married for a second time in 1965 to Ambrose Shardlow. In 1962 a young Australian called Heather Blundell flew to Britain for the first time and stayed with Janet and her husband Joe and became a very close friend. Her relationship with Janet Morgan helped her achieve great success. Morgan wrote a book in 1953 entitled Squash rackets for women and has been inducted in the Squash Hall of Fame.	SquashPlayer

Autoroute 410 (or A-410) is a short peri-urban multilane highway in Sherbrooke, Quebec. It is currently a branch from Autoroute 10 (Autoroute des Cantons-de-l'Est) to the Mont-Bellevue/Ascot district. Its future terminus will be east of Lennoxville. Autoroute 410 is 12.9 km (8.0 mi) in length. The initial segment was opened from A-10 to Boulevard Bourque (Route 112) in 1971 as a two-lane freeway. The route was opened to Boulevard de l'Université in 1978, and the entire A-410 became a 4-lane divided highway in 1981. In March 2007, A-410 was renamed after Jacques O'Bready, the former mayor of Sherbrooke and president of the Commission municipale du Québec. In May 2009, work started on Phase 1 of the A-410 extension to Lennoxville. An interchange was built over Boulevard de l'Université, another over Belvédère Street, south of Mont-Bellevue and the last one at R-108/R-143 south of Lennoxville. The project was expected to be completed in 2014. Due to delays, the Belvédère Street interchange was opened in November 2014, with the 108/143 interchange opened in November 2015. Phase 2 will bypass Lennoxville, with a bridge built over the Massawippi river and culminating at R-108 near Glenday Road, Alexander Galt Regional High School and the Dairy and Swine Research and Development Centre. This phase will complete the southern bypass road for Sherbrooke, mirroring the role of A-610 as northern bypass.	Road

Chrome Hill /ˈkruːm/ is a limestone reef knoll on the Derbyshire side of the upper Dove valley. It is adjacent to the more distinctive but lower Parkhouse Hill. Chrome Hill was declared open access land under the provisions of the Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000. However, the only access from the North West remains along a concessionary footpath. Chrome Hill contains good exposures of Gigantoproductus fossils; it is part of a designated Site of Special Scientific Interest and visitors are asked not to remove geological samples. In 1997, the writer Jeff Kent discovered that a double sunset could be seen against Chrome Hill from the southern flank of Parkhouse Hill. Two years later, the author discovered that a similar event took place from nearby Glutton Bridge, on the upper valley of the River Dove, which was more easily accessible. Shortly afterwards, the phenomenon was first captured on film by the photographer Chris Doherty. Since 2002, Kent has offered guided public viewings of the occurrence from Glutton Bridge on the summer solstice, with a fair degree of success. The phenomenon is visible from Glutton Bridge in good weather for a short period around the summer solstice, when the sun sets just to the southwest of the summit of Chrome Hill, begins to re-emerge almost immediately afterwards from its steep northeastern slope before fully reappearing and later sets for a second and final time at the foot of the hill. The precise event and its location are described in Kent's book The Mysterious Double Sunset. Chrome Hill has had songs written in its honour by the Norwegian musicians Sigurd Hole (Chrome Hill) and Jonas Howden Sjøvaag (Up on Chrome Hill). In 2008 the Norwegian jazz quartet Damp changed its name to Chrome Hill.	Mountain
"Saint Quirinus of Neuss (German: Quirin, Quirinus), sometimes called Quirinus of Rome (which is the name shared by another martyr) is venerated as a martyr and saint of the Catholic and Eastern Orthodox churches. His cult was centered at Neuss in Germany, though he was a Roman martyr. According to the Catholic Encyclopedia, a Roman martyr named Quirinus was buried in the Catacomb of Prætextatus on the Via Appia. The Martyrologium Hieronymianum (ed. De Rossi-Duchesne, 52) mentions Quirinus' name and place of burial. The Itineraries to the graves of the Roman martyrs (Giovanni Battista De Rossi, \""Roma sotterranea\"", I, 180-1) also mention these two pieces of information. The Martyrologium Hieronymianum  assigns him under the feast day of April 30, the date that appears in the catalogue of Roman martyrs of the 4th century."	Saint

"George Robert Marshman (September 24, 1936 - December 3, 1964), was an American racecar driver. Born the son of auto race promoters George and Evelyn Marshman in Pottstown, Pennsylvania, Marshman died in San Antonio, Texas of injuries sustained in a tire test in Phoenix, Arizona. He drove in the USAC Championship Car series, racing in the 1961-1964 seasons, with 49 career starts, including each Indianapolis 500 contest in that span. He finished in the top ten 25 times, with one victory, in 1962 at the Arizona State Fairgrounds in Phoenix. His 7th-place finish at the 1961 Indianapolis 500 earned him co-Rookie of the Year honors with Parnelli Jones. Marshman may be best known for his performance during the 1964 Indianapolis 500. Early in the race, following a fiery crash that clained the lives of Eddie Sachs and Dave MacDonald, Marshman took the lead from polesitter and race favorite Jim Clark. Marshman, driving a Lotus 29-Ford, extended his lead until the 37th lap, when he was forced off the track to avoid hitting a slower car driven by Johnny White. The instant he spent off the track tore loose oil and water lines, and retired the car. Many observers felt Marshman was on his way to a comfortable victory before luck intervened. A story from the time holds that Marshman wandered the crowd for an hour before returning to the pits and his crew. Marshman, dressed in his fireproof overalls and with oily goggle-marks around his eyes, was holding a race program. Jack Beckley, Marshman's crew chief, studied him quizzically and finally asked, \""what are you doing with that?\"" An embarrassed and crestfallen Marshman replied, \""I thought if I bought it no one would know I was a driver and they wouldn't ask me silly questions.\"" On November 27, 1964, Marshman was conducting tire tests at the Phoenix 1-mile paved oval. When his Lotus-Ford crashed into the west retaining wall and ruptured the fuel tank, he was not wearing fire-retardant clothing to protect him according to some reports. First able to leave the wreck unassisted, Marshman succumbed to his second and third degree burns six days later. About a year after her husband's death, Marshman's widow, Janet F. Marshman, sued Ford Motor Company for $5 million, claiming that the crash resulted from negligence by the car owner, purported to be Ford, which also failed to comply with a warranty that the car was safe according to the suit. The first Bobby Marshman Memorial race, which featured ARDC midget cars and was promoted by George Marshman, was held at Hatfield Speedway in June 1966."	NascarDriver

"Peter Takeo Okada (岡田 武夫 Okada Takeo, born 24 October 1941) is a Japanese clergyman of the Roman Catholic Church. He is the current archbishop of Tokyo. Okada was born in Ichikawa in Chiba Prefecture. He graduated from the University of Tokyo with the LL.B. He was ordained a priest on 3 November 1973. On 15 April 1991, he was appointed bishop of Urawa by Pope John Paul II. He received his episcopal consecration on the following 16 September from Seiichi Shirayanagi, with Archbishops Paul Hisao Yasuda and Francis Xavier Kaname Shimamoto serving as co-consecrators. Following the early resignation of Cardinal Shirayanagi, he was appointed archbishop of Tokyo on 17 February 2000. His installation took place on the following 3 September. In addition to his role as Archbishop, he is president of the Japanese bishops' conference. According to reports, Archbishop Okada was likely to be made a cardinal by Pope Benedict XVI at a consistory in November 2010. However he was not among the cardinals that were created during the consistory of 20 November that year. In February 2011, Archbishop Okada in defending the rejection of the Neocatechumenal Way in Japanese dioceses said \""the Way's activities over the past 30 years can in no way be called a success. The fact is that the character and conduct of the Way have not adapted well to the Church or society of Japan. It is perhaps necessary for the Way in Japan to suspend its activities for a period of consideration and reflection which could pave the way for dialog with the Church in Japan\"". He continued saying \""For thirteen years now, more than 30,000 people a year have committed suicide in Japan. I want the people of the Way to see this reality. I want them to grapple first and foremost with the question of what they can do for these people. If they act in ways that the members of Japanese society can understand and sympathize with, they will surely gain this society's trust. I pray and hope that they will join us in undertaking evangelisation tailored for the needs of the people of Japan.\"""	ChristianBishop

The black storm petrel (Oceanodroma melania) is a small seabird of the storm petrel family Hydrobatidae. It is 23 cm in length, with a wingspan of 46–51 cm. The species breeds colonially on islands off the southern California coast of the United States and off the Baja Peninsula and Gulf of California of Mexico. Nesting sites are usually in rock crevices, occasionally in small burrows in soft earth. It also uses unused burrows from auklets. Colonies are attended nocturnally in order to avoid predatory birds such as gulls, peregrine falcons and owls. Like most petrels, its walking ability is limited to a short shuffle to the burrow. The female lays a single white egg per breeding season, if the egg is lost then it is replaced only rarely. Both parents share incubation duties, incubation lasting around 50 days. The chick is brooded for a few days after hatching until it is able to thermoregulate by itself, after which both parents forage to provide food. Chicks fledge 10 weeks after hatching. The black storm petrel spends the rest of the year at sea, but occurring closer to shore than most other storm-petrels. Because of this, it sometimes can be seen from the mainland. It undertakes a migration away from the waters surrounding its breeding colonies and, unusually, has two wintering grounds, one in the California Current off Central California and another further south off the coast of Central America as far south as Colombia and Ecuador. It is thought to migrate in this fashion in order to avoid hurricanes in its breeding grounds. It feeds on mainly planktonic crustaceans, with a preference of larvae of spiny lobster. It will also take small fish and offal. It feeds using several techniques, including plunge diving to 1 m below the water's surface from flight, feeding while swimming on the surface, and feeding while flying. At sea it usually forages singly. The black storm petrel is a common species, numbering several million pairs, and is not considered threatened. It has suffered losses on some of the breeding islands, particularly from feral cats and rats. Island restoration projects have removed these predators from several of its nesting islands.	Bird

Chicha or Peruvian cumbia is a subgenre of Cumbia that became popular in the coastal cities of Peru, mainly in Lima in the 1960s through the fusion of local versions of the original Colombian genre, traditional highland huayno, and rock music, particularly surf rock and psychedelic rock. The term Chicha is more frequently used for the pre-1990s variations of the subgenre. Unlike other styles of cumbia, the Chicha subgenre's harmonics are based on the pentatonic scale typical of Andean music. It is played with keyboards or synthesizers and up to three electric guitars that can play simultaneous melodies, an element derived from the harp and guitar lines of Andean huayno. The rhythmic electric guitar in chicha is played with upstrokes, following patterns derived from Peruvian coastal creole waltz. Chicha songs contain electric guitar solos, following the rock music tradition.	MusicGenre
