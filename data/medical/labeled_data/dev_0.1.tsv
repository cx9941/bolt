Doppler echocardiographic assessment of changes in pulmonary artery pressure associated with vasodilating therapy in patients with congestive heart failure. Transpulmonic pressure gradient and pulmonary artery pressures can be estimated from the Doppler pulmonary regurgitant flow velocities by applying the simplified Bernoulli equation. In this study, continuous-wave Doppler echocardiography was used to assess changes in pulmonary regurgitant flow velocities associated with administration of vasodilators in 10 patients with congestive heart failure. M-Mode echocardiographic parameters such as left ventricular end-systolic and end-diastolic dimension and fractional shortening did not change with administration of vasodilators. Pulmonary regurgitant flow velocity at end diastole decreased from 1.9 +/- 0.6 to 1.3 +/- 0.3 m/sec (p less than 0.01), and Doppler-estimated transpulmonic pressure gradient at end diastole decreased from 16 +/- 11 to 8 +/- 4 mm Hg (p less than 0.01). Doppler-estimated transpulmonic pressure gradient at end diastole was compared with catheterization-determined pulmonary arterial end-diastolic pressure before and after administration of vasodilators in three patients, and there was a good agreement between these measurements. Thus noninvasive and sensitive assessment of the effect of vasodilators on pulmonary arterial end-diastolic pressure in patients with congestive heart failure is possible with continuous-wave Doppler echocardiographic measurement of pulmonary regurgitant flow velocities. 	cardiovascular diseases
Vascular and calcemic effects of plasma of spontaneously hypertensive rats. Circulating substances that increase intracellular calcium, and other circulating substances that increase blood pressure, have been described in hypertensive animals and humans. In this study, we report the existence of a factor of the plasma of spontaneously hypertensive rats that does both. These effects were dose-dependent, and the time course for such effects was correlated with the time course for potentiation of pressor agents by the plasma. In addition, the plasma of spontaneously hypertensive rats was found to inhibit the depressor effects of parathyroid hormone. Our results confirm the presence of a circulating hypertensive factor in the plasma of spontaneously hypertensive rats, which may act by increasing calcium uptake in vascular smooth muscle. These findings may also help explain the secondary increase in parathyroid hormone noted in some forms of human and experimental hypertension. 	cardiovascular diseases
Hot-tip laser. Results and complications. The hot tip laser system for atheroablation has been used since mid-1984 as a device for broadening the indications for and extending the applicability of angioplasty in the management of lower-extremity atherosclerosis. It has been a controversial device. Although the system demonstrates that it can occasionally be useful for the management of occlusive as opposed to stenotic disease of the infrainguinal arteries, a close examination of the published data fails to demonstrate a consistent improvement in either the primary success or long-term patency rates for thermal energy applied to atheroma for recanalization of the lower extremity arteries. 	cardiovascular diseases
Mapping of a functional autoimmune epitope on the beta 1-adrenergic receptor in patients with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy. The presence and properties of serum autoantibodies against beta-adrenergic receptors in patients with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy were studied using synthetic peptides derived from the predicted sequences of the human beta-adrenergic receptors. Peptides corresponding to the sequences of the second extracellular loop of the human beta 1- and beta 2-adrenergic receptors were used as antigens in an enzyme immunoassay to screen sera from patients with dilated cardiomyopathy (n = 42), ischemic heart disease (n = 17), or healthy blood donors (n = 34). The sera of thirteen dilated cardiomyopathy patients, none of the ischemic heart disease patients, and four of the healthy controls monospecifically recognized the beta 1-peptide. Only affinity-purified antibodies of these patients had a inhibitory effect on radioligand binding to the beta 1 receptor of C6 rat glioma cells. They recognized the receptor protein by immunoblot and bound in situ to human myocardial tissue. We conclude that a subgroup of patients with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy have in their sera autoantibodies specifically directed against the second extracellular loop of the beta 1-adrenergic receptor. These antibodies could serve as a marker of an autoimmune response with physiological and/or pathological implications. 	cardiovascular diseases
Vascular entrapment of intra-aortic balloon after short-term balloon counterpulsation. Prolonged, continuous intra-aortic balloon (IAB) counterpulsation for several weeks can result in balloon entrapment secondary to thrombus formation in the balloon lumen. In this report, we describe a patient who developed IAB entrapment, early (1 wk) after initiation of counterpulsation. A trace amount of blood was noted in the tubing connecting the balloon catheter to the console for 3 days prior to IAB malfunction and vascular entrapment. We suggest that the balloon catheter be removed immediately when blood is detected in the external connecting tubing even if the IAB is functioning satisfactorily. 	cardiovascular diseases
Cutaneous manifestations of multiple myeloma. We report the cutaneous manifestations of multiple myeloma, using a retrospective review of 115 patients' records obtained from tumor registry files. Five patients were found to have biopsy-proved extramedullary plasmacytomas without extension from an underlying bony focus. Twelve patients had ecchymoses without thrombocytopenia; two of them had biopsy-proved amyloidosis. One patient presented with pyoderma gangrenosum and was subsequently diagnosed with multiple myeloma. The last patient initially presented with what clinically appeared to be leukocytoclastic vasculitis, and, in the course of a standard workup, he was diagnosed with multiple myeloma. These findings are discussed with regard to the current literature on the cutaneous manifestations of multiple myeloma. 	cardiovascular diseases
Arginine vasopressin gene expression in chronic cardiac failure in rats. Arginine vasopressin (AVP) is known to be increased in patients and experimental animals with chronic cardiac failure (CCF). The importance of an increase in biosynthesis of AVP in the hypothalamus has, however, not heretofore been investigated and is the purpose of the present study. CCF secondary to infarction of myocardial tissue was induced by ligation of the left anterior descending coronary artery and sham operated animals served as controls. Four weeks later hypothalamic AVP mRNA was determined by solution hybridization using sense and anti-sense strand RNA. The blood pressure was lower in CCF than sham animals (131.2 +/- 3.1 vs. 112.8 +/- 4.0 mm Hg, P less than 0.05) and the total heart, and right and left ventricle weights were significantly higher in CCF rats. Plasma AVP was higher in CCF (sham 6.78 +/- 0.30; CCF 11.46 +/- 0.64 pg/ml, P less than 0.001) and plasma atrial natriuretic peptide was also higher in CCF than sham animals (205 +/- 36 vs. 554 +/- 56 pg/ml, P less than 0.001). The AVP mRNA in hypothalamus was significantly higher in CCF than sham animals (55.5 +/- 3.7 vs. 95.9 +/- 4.0 pg/micrograms total RNA, P less than 0.001). There was no difference in beta-actin mRNA in the hypothalamus of sham and CCF rats, indicating that the AVP-mRNA increase was specific in CCF. These results therefore demonstrate that increased AVP biosynthesis in the hypothalamus, in addition to release of the hormone from the posterior pituitary, may occur in CCF. 	cardiovascular diseases
Pulse rate, coronary heart disease, and death: the NHANES I Epidemiologic Follow-up Study. To determine whether associations of elevated resting pulse rate with CHD incidence or death in white men are independent of other risk factors and whether such associations exist for women and blacks, data were examined from the NHANES I Epidemiologic Follow-up Study. Over a follow-up period of 6 to 13 years, elevated RR for CHD incidence were found for older white men with baseline pulse greater than 84 beats/min compared with less than 74 beats/min after controlling multiple risk factors (RR = 1.37, 95% CL 1.02, 1.84). Risks of death from all causes, cardiovascular diseases, and noncardiovascular diseases were also elevated for white men with elevated pulse rate independent of other risk factors. CHD incidence was increased in white women with elevated pulse rate. Risks of death from all causes, cardiovascular diseases, and noncardiovascular diseases, were also elevated for white men with elevated pulse rate independent of other risk factors. CHD incidence was increased in white women with elevated pulse rate. Risk of death from all causes and cardiovascular diseases was elevated in black men and women with elevated pulse rate. Risk of death from noncardiovascular disease was elevated in black men with elevated pulse rate. The association with cardiovascular death was particularly striking in black women, even after adjusting for baseline risk factors (RR 3.03, 95% CL 1.46, 6.28). Further studies are needed to assess associations of pulse rate with CHD in blacks and to elucidate mechanisms in all groups. 	cardiovascular diseases
Low-dose aspirin does not influence the clinical course of women with mild pregnancy-induced hypertension. The effect of low doses of aspirin on women with mild pregnancy-induced hypertension was investigated by means of a prospective, randomized, double-blind trial. Forty-seven women hospitalized at 30-36 weeks' gestation because of mild pregnancy-induced hypertension were treated by a daily dose of either 100 mg aspirin or placebo. The mean blood pressure values, rates of development of severe preeclampsia, gestational ages at delivery, newborn weights, and 5-minute Apgar scores were similar in the aspirin-treated and the placebo-treated groups. We conclude that low-dose aspirin is not curative but is essentially a preventive treatment which, in order to be effective, should be started weeks before clinical signs of preeclampsia are present. 	cardiovascular diseases
Leukocyte counts and activation in spontaneously hypertensive and normotensive rats The etiology for the progressive organ injury in hypertension is largely speculative. Recent studies have shown that leukocytes play a key role in several cardiovascular diseases. As an initial step toward investigating the role of leukocytes in hypertension, we measured leukocyte counts and spontaneous activation of granulocytes of freshly drawn unseparated blood samples in spontaneously hypertensive rats and in their normotensive counterpart, Wistar-Kyoto rats. The animals were derived from one breeder in the United States and from two breeders in Europe. Total leukocyte counts in young, mature, and old hypertensive rats were 50-100% above the controls. The number of granulocytes in mature and old spontaneously hypertensive rats in more than 100% elevated compared with control rats. In young hypertensive rats the mean granulocyte count was only slightly elevated. The number of spontaneously activated granulocytes, as detected by the nitroblue tetrazolium reduction, increases with age in both species; in mature spontaneously hypertensive rats, it is more than 300% above the values in the controls. Furthermore, in mature hypertensive rats the number of monocytes, activated monocytes, and the lymphocyte count are also significantly elevated over the values in the normotensive controls. It is proposed that these elevated leukocyte counts may constitute an enhanced risk for organ injury in the spontaneously hypertensive rat. 	cardiovascular diseases
Hemodynamics in internal carotid artery occlusion examined by positron emission tomography. Using positron emission tomography in nine patients with minor strokes, unilateral internal carotid artery occlusion, and good collateral circulation through the anterior portion of the circle of Willis, we analyzed regional cerebral blood flow, cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen, oxygen extraction fraction, and cerebral blood volume. These studies allowed quantification of the regional hemodynamic status, especially in relation to watershed areas. Compared with eight normal controls, the patients had significantly (p less than 0.01) decreased regional cerebral blood flow in the middle cerebral artery territory and the surrounding watershed areas of the occluded hemisphere. The oxygen extraction fraction rose with the distance from the anterior portion of the circle of Willis, attaining the highest value in the superior parietal and posterior temporo-occipital watershed area. A concomitant decrease in the cerebral blood flow/cerebral blood volume ratio suggested reduction in the mean blood flow velocity, whereby elevated blood viscosity would be more liable to reduce cerebral blood flow. These findings suggest hemodynamic vulnerability of the watershed areas after internal carotid artery occlusion in persons with good collateral circulation through the anterior portion of the circle of Willis. Our results also emphasize the importance of systemic hemodynamic factors such as blood pressure and circulating blood volume in the genesis of watershed infarction. 	cardiovascular diseases
Hypertension, endothelium, and cardiovascular risk factors. The functions of the endothelium and the effects of hypertension, atherosclerosis, and diabetes on the endothelium are reviewed. The endothelium affects vascular tone by releasing vasodilators and modulating the effects of vasoactive substances such as catecholamines, bradykinin, serotonin, and angiotensin II. Relaxation of vascular smooth muscle depends upon a functionally intact endothelium and the release of the endothelium-derived relaxing factor nitric oxide. Endothelial cells also appear to release a hyperpolarizing factor that relaxes smooth muscle through activation of the sodium-potassium pump, and of the endothelium-dependent contracting factors. Similarities are found in the vascular injury resulting from hypertension, atherosclerosis, and diabetes. When these risk factors coexist, they can act synergistically and magnify the vascular injury. The endothelium appears to be one of the major targets for these forms of injury. Future therapeutic strategies will focus on ways to prevent, arrest, or reverse endothelial injury. 	cardiovascular diseases
Accuracy of exercise electrocardiography in detecting physiologically significant coronary arterial lesions. The accuracy of exercise electrocardiography in detecting a physiologically significant coronary artery stenosis has been assessed previously by comparing the exercise test with a coronary arteriogram. The inherent inaccuracy of visually determined percent diameter stenosis measurements might have lead to the conclusion that the exercise electrocardiogram was less accurate than it truly was. To determine the accuracy of the exercise electrocardiography in detecting a physiologically significant coronary stenosis, we studied 40 patients with one-vessel, one-lesion coronary artery disease, a normal resting electrocardiogram, and no hypertrophy or prior infarction. Each patient underwent exercise electrocardiography (Bruce protocol) that was interpreted as abnormal if the ST segment developed 0.1-mV or greater depression 80 msec after the J point. The physiological significance of each coronary stenosis was assessed by measuring of coronary flow reserve (peak divided by resting blood flow velocity) in the stenotic artery using a Doppler catheter and intracoronary papaverine (normal, 3.5 or greater peak/resting velocity). The percent diameter and percent area stenosis produced by each lesion were determined using quantitative angiography (Brown/Dodge method). Of the 17 patients with reduced coronary flow reserve (3.5 or greater peak/resting blood flow velocity) in the stenotic artery, 14 had an abnormal exercise electrocardiogram (sensitivity, 0.82; 95% confidence interval, 0.70-0.94). Conversely, 20 of 23 patients with normal coronary flow reserves had normal exercise tests (specificity, 0.87; 95% confidence interval, 0.77-0.97). The exercise electrocardiogram was abnormal in each of 11 patients with markedly reduced coronary flow reserve (less than 2.5 peak/resting velocity) and in three of six patients with moderately reduced reserve (2.5-3.4 peak/resting velocity). The products of systolic blood pressure and heart rate at peak exercise were significantly correlated with coronary reserve in patients with truly abnormal exercise tests. In comparison, the sensitivity (0.61; 95% confidence interval, 0.46-0.76) and specificity (0.73; 95% confidence interval, 0.60-0.86) of exercise electrocardiography in detecting a 60% or greater diameter stenosis may be significantly lower (p less than 0.05). Exercise electrocardiography, therefore, was a good predictor of the physiological significance (assessed by coronary flow reserve) of a coronary stenosis in patients with a normal resting electrocardiogram and no hypertrophy or prior infarction. Its value in a broader and larger patient population will require further study. These results, however, underscore the importance of a physiological gold standard in assessing the accuracy of noninvasive studies for detecting coronary artery disease. 	cardiovascular diseases
Surgery for Ebstein's anomaly: the clinical and echocardiographic evaluation of a new technique. Ten consecutive patients (age range 4 to 44 years, mean 22) underwent surgical repair of Ebstein's anomaly by vertical plication of the right ventricle and reimplantation of the tricuspid valve leaflets. No patient died during or after operation. Intraoperative postbypass echocardiography documented a good result in nine patients but severe tricuspid regurgitation in one patient, who then underwent prosthetic valve replacement during a second period of cardiopulmonary bypass. Two of four patients who had had right ventricular papillary muscle dysfunction in the early postoperative period showed improved papillary muscle function with concomitant reduction of tricuspid regurgitation 6 months later. All patients were evaluated clinically and by echocardiography 2 to 23 months later. All patients showed clinical improvement, seven by one functional class and three by two classes. All were in sinus rhythm. The mean cardiothoracic ratio decreased by 6% (p less than 0.05). On bicycle ergometry performed in six patients, peak oxygen consumption exceeded 20 ml/kg per min in five. Tricuspid regurgitation diminished in eight patients (by three grades in two patients, by two grades in five and by one grade in one patient); it remained unchanged in two. Comparison of preoperative and postoperative pulsed Doppler flow velocities across the pulmonary valve showed an increase in the peak velocity of flow across the valve (mean 83 +/- 14 versus 97 +/- 11 cm/s, p less than 0.005) and a decrease in the time to peak velocity (mean 130 +/- 16 versus 91 +/- 23 ms, p less than 0.05). 	cardiovascular diseases
Dynamic changes in left ventricular outflow tract flow velocities after amyl nitrite inhalation in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Doppler echocardiography was performed in 21 patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HC), in nine patients with no evidence of left ventricular (LV) hypertrophy by two-dimensional echocardiography, and in five patients with systemic hypertension and concentric LV hypertrophy. The LV outflow tract (LVOT) peak velocity was recorded by continuous wave Doppler technique at rest and after amyl nitrite inhalation. The LVOT pressure gradient was calculated by the modified Bernoulli equation. A significant increase in heart rate and a drop in systolic blood pressure were observed in all patients after amyl nitrite inhalation; no adverse effects were encountered. The peak LVOT velocity and pressure gradient increased significantly after provocation in all patients, but the increase was much more pronounced in patients with HC (peak LVOT velocity increased from 2.2 +/- 0.8 to 4.3 +/- 1.0 m/sec and peak gradient increased from 22 +/- 17 to 78 +/- 36 mm Hg). The Doppler spectral signal in patients with HC demonstrated a characteristic contour, with peak velocity occurring in late systole. However, the observed increase in LVOT peak velocity was not statistically different between treated (with beta-blockers and calcium blockers) and untreated patients with HC. We conclude that LVOT peak velocity and pressure gradients in patients with HC can be readily assessed by Doppler echocardiography both at rest and after amyl nitrite inhalation. The dynamic changes in LVOT velocity induced by this provocation have certain characteristic features in obstructive HC but appear to be independent of the medical regimen used, at least in the dosages tested in our study. 	cardiovascular diseases
Left ventricular passive diastolic properties in chronic mitral regurgitation. BACKGROUND. In chronic mitral regurgitation, the myocardium responds to the increased filling volume by geometric alteration and eccentric hypertrophy. This study was designed to evaluate the effects of a pure volume overload on left ventricular diastolic chamber and myocardial properties and to assess the relation of passive diastolic function to systolic ejection performance. METHODS AND RESULTS. By use of simultaneous cineangiography and left ventricular micromanometry, left ventricular passive diastolic stiffness was evaluated in nine normal controls (group 1), 14 patients with chronic mitral regurgitation and a normal ejection fraction (greater than or equal to 57%, group 2), and 13 patients with mitral regurgitation and a reduced ejection fraction (less than 57%, group 3). Passive diastolic function was evaluated by using a three-constant elastic model. Left ventricular chamber properties were represented by the relation of pressure to volume; myocardial properties were evaluated by relating myocardial midwall stress to midwall strain. The constant of left ventricular chamber stiffness was decreased in group 2 compared with controls (p less than 0.05) but it was normal in group 3. The constant of myocardial stiffness was increased in group 3 compared with groups 1 and 2 (p less than 0.01). Among patients with mitral regurgitation, there was a significant inverse relation between ejection fraction and the constant of myocardial stiffness (r = -0.83). CONCLUSIONS. The chronic adaptation to volume overload in chronic mitral regurgitation tends to decrease left ventricular chamber stiffness. Patients with mitral regurgitation and a depressed ejection fraction demonstrated diastolic myocardial dysfunction. Compromised diastolic function in patients with chronic mitral regurgitation and reduced systolic performance may contribute to the clinical manifestations of congestive heart failure. 	cardiovascular diseases
A case report of giant cell arteritis of the uterus and adnexa. Giant cell arteritis of the uterus and adnexa is a rare disorder, which is generally asymptomatic and occasionally associated with temporal arteritis. The true clinical significance of this dramatic microscopic finding remains obscure, but arteritis of the uterus and adnexa may be associated with later development of giant cell arteritis elsewhere in the body. 	cardiovascular diseases
Increased platelet membrane sodium-proton exchange rate in spontaneously hypertensive rats. It has been proposed that increased Na-H exchange activity is involved in the pathophysiology of genetic hypertension. We studied platelets of spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR), normotensive Wistar-Kyoto (WKY), and domestic Wistar rats (DWR), since platelets have similarities to smooth muscle cells and have been shown to have potentially related ion metabolism abnormalities, such as increased intracellular calcium activity. We determined the exchange rate by the intracellular acidification-dependent, extracellular sodium-dependent volume increase. The rate of increase during the first 3 min is linear and is shown to be higher in SHR (0.475 X min-1) than in WKY (0.410 X min-1) or DWR (0.389 X min-1). We conclude that the Na-H activity is increased in platelets of SHR. Similar findings in lymphocytes and neutrophils of SHR, and analogous findings in platelets of humans with essential hypertension, suggest that this abnormality is expressed by several cell types, some of which may be involved in the pathophysiology of genetic hypertension in both rats and humans. 	cardiovascular diseases
Coronary perfusion catheter: its effectiveness in an experimental model of acute coronary occlusion. The effectiveness of a coronary perfusion catheter was studied in an animal model of acute coronary occlusion. Systemic hemodynamic variables, regional myocardial blood flow (RMBF) in the subepicardium and subendocardium, and regional systolic function (systolic segmental shortening) of the area perfused by the circumflex coronary artery (CX) were measured in eight anesthetized dogs. After baseline measurements, the CX coronary artery was occluded with a silk snare and measurements were repeated after 5 minutes of ischemia (occlusion No. 1). The snare was released and 1 hour later the snare occlusion was repeated after placement of a perfusion catheter in the CX coronary artery. After 5 minutes, measurements were repeated (occlusion No. 2). To determine the long-term effectiveness of the catheter, hemodynamic variables and regional function measurements were then obtained every 15 minutes for a total of 60 minutes. During occlusion No. 1, RMBF decreased from 1.30 +/- 0.20 to 0.41 +/- 0.13 ml.min-1.gm-1 (p less than 0.01), and subendocardial RMBF decreased from 1.44 +/- .24 to 0.34 +/- 0.15 ml.min-1.gm-1 (p less than 0.01). After insertion of the perfusion catheter (occlusion No. 2), subepicardial RMBF was maintained at 0.97 +/- 0.16 and subendocardial RMBF was maintained at 0.78 +/- 0.13 ml.min-1.gm-1; during occlusion No. 2 subepicardial RMBF was greater (p less than 0.05) than occlusion No. 1 and was not different from baseline. 	cardiovascular diseases
Coronary ostial reconstruction: technical issues. Coronary ostial reconstruction may be the preferred alternative to reestablish antegrade myocardial revascularization in patients with isolated ostial stenosis. The technical steps of reconstruction are described. The ultrasonic aspirator is a helpful implement in the dissection of the left main and the proximal right coronary arteries. Satisfactory results of coronary ostial reconstruction in the current era seem to fulfill its promise. 	cardiovascular diseases
Mental stress as a provocative test in patients with various clinical syndromes of coronary heart disease. To assess the prevalence of mental stress-induced myocardial ischemia and investigate the pathogenetic mechanisms by which emotional stress may induce myocardial ischemia, we studied 372 patients with angina pectoris who underwent mental arithmetic and exercise stress testings. Hyperventilation tests were also performed in 176 patients, and 340 patients underwent coronary arteriography. Sixty-one patients showed significant ST segment abnormalities during mental arithmetic and exercise stress testings (group 1). Two hundred eleven patients had negative responses to mental stress but positive exercise tests (group 2), whereas both tests were negative in 100 patients (group 3). Mental stress induced significant increases in heart rate and systolic blood pressure in the three groups of patients; however, group 1 patients had higher increases in rate-pressure product (mm Hg x beats/min) than group 2 and group 3 patients (14,909 +/- 3,894 versus 12,985 +/- 2,900 versus 12,724 +/- 4,400 mm Hg x beats/min, p less than 0.01). Group 1 patients had shorter exercise durations than group 2 or group 3 (4.06 +/- 1.55 versus 7.65 +/- 3.07 versus 13.9 +/- 5.31 minutes, p less than 0.01), although rate-pressure products at peak exercise were similar in groups 1 and 2 (20,277 +/- 6,058 versus 20,768 +/- 3,864, p = NS) and significantly higher in group 3 (26,221 +/- 7,100/mm Hg x beats/min, p less than 0.01). 	cardiovascular diseases
Regression of the left main trunk lesion by steroid administration in Takayasu's aortitis. A 62-year-old man with unstable angina due to severe narrowing of the left main trunk (LMT) was examined. Emergency bypass surgery was performed with an internal mammary artery graft, instead of a saphenous vein graft, because of the thickened, edematous ascending aorta. Postoperative coronary angiography showed the lesion of the LMT markedly regressing. Presumably, this stenotic lesion of the LMT was caused by active aortitis and was partially reversible by steroid administration both during and after surgery. Steroid therapy can be added to the list of treatments for cases of LMT disease associated with Takayasu's aortitis, if signs of active inflammation are present. 	cardiovascular diseases
The cardiovascular effects of cocaine. Cocaine use and abuse continue to overwhelm urban economic, social, and health care systems. Patients frequently present to the emergency department with life-threatening manifestations of cocaine use, including trauma, acquired immune deficiency syndrome, psychomotor agitation, and cardiovascular collapse. Adequate treatment of the cocaine-intoxicated patient requires a critical understanding of the risk-to-benefit ratios for pharmacologic, toxicologic, and surgical or obstetric interventions. The pharmacologic and physiologic bases for the vascular manifestations of cocaine toxicity and experimental evidence for treatment strategies are reviewed. 	cardiovascular diseases
Warm induction blood cardioplegia in the infant. A technique to avoid rapid cooling myocardial contracture. The use of profound hypothermia and total circulatory arrest for repair of heart defects in neonates usually involves a period of systemic and myocardial bypass cooling. Rapid cooling of muscle (skeletal, smooth, and myocardial) can result in contracture through elevation of cytosolic calcium levels. The increased myocardial tone caused by cooling might render the heart more vulnerable to a subsequent period of cardioplegic ischemic arrest. Infants may be more susceptible to contracture because their small body mass allows more rapid myocardial temperature change when prearrest bypass cooling is used. The influence of avoiding rapid myocardial cooling before induced cardioplegic arrest was analyzed in a group of infants weighing less than 6 kg at the time of open cardiac operation. Myocardial ischemic arrest by warm (37 degrees C) induction blood cardioplegia was used in 57 infants and compared with results in 440 infants treated with standard blood cardioplegia. Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that patient diagnosis, weight, and age at operation were significant risk factors for operative mortality. The use of warm induction blood cardioplegia had a strongly positive independent effect on survival (p = 0.0003) for any patient weight, age, or diagnostic group. We recommend the avoidance of rapid myocardial cooling on bypass in all patients before induction of cardioplegic ischemic arrest. 	cardiovascular diseases
Recovery from disturbed colonic transit time after alcohol withdrawal. The effects of alcohol withdrawal on total and segmental transit time were evaluated in 20 chronic alcoholic subjects. After withdrawal, colorectal transit time significantly increased from 24.9 +/- 3.6 to 33.3 +/- 4.5 hours mean +/- SE (P less than 0.01). This was the result of an exclusive increase in rectosigmoid transit time from 2.8 +/- 0.7 to 9.8 +/- 2.1 hours (P less than 0.001). No variations were found in right or left colon transit time. Distal colonic motility is thus a crucial factor in the genesis of diarrhea in chronic alcoholic subjects. 	digestive system diseases
Effect of marked peripheral leukocytosis on the leukocyte count in ascites. Patients with high peripheral leukocyte counts are sometimes found to have high leukocyte counts in ascitic fluid in the presence of negative cultures. To determine if peripheral leukocytosis (greater than or equal to 20 x 10(9)/L) by itself can result in high leukocyte or neutrophil counts in ascites, 29 patients were studied. A total of 31 paracenteses were performed in these patients as soon as the high peripheral leukocyte count was determined. Culture of ascitic fluid was performed using blood-culture bottles. The mean peripheral leukocyte count was 29.3 +/- 9.3 x 10(9)/L, with a mean neutrophil count of 19.9 +/- 6.5 x 10(9)/L. The mean ascitic fluid neutrophil count was 0.064 +/- 0.054 x 10(9)/L (range, 0.007 to 0.197 x 10(9)/L). No significant correlation was found between peripheral neutrophil (or leukocyte) count and neutrophil (or leukocyte) count in ascitic fluid. Marked peripheral leukocytosis (or neutrophilia) does not seem to have an effect on the leukocyte or neutrophil count in ascitic fluid. 	digestive system diseases
Endoscopic sclerotherapy for control of bleeding varices in children. Thirty-three children with esophageal varices due to portal hypertension underwent injection sclerotherapy over a period of 6 yr. Thirty-one completed the sclerotherapy course, and the varices were eradicated in all. In nine, the procedure was performed as an emergency because of continued bleeding and, in each case, a gastric fundal varix was the source of the blood loss. Sclerotherapy successfully controlled the bleeding in four of these, whereas five required surgical underrunning of the fundal varix. After surgery, these five continued sclerotherapy until the esophageal varices were eradicated. Complications included transient pyrexia (39%), retrosternal discomfort (30%), esophageal ulceration (18%), and esophageal stricture (12%). Rebleeding before initial eradication of the varices occurred in 12 patients but, thereafter, was very uncommon and always small in amount. Esophageal varices recurred after initial eradication in 33% of cases but were easily sclerosed with further injections. This study demonstrates that sclerotherapy is effective in reducing bleeding frequency in children with portal hypertension, but emphasizes the need for regular follow-up endoscopy after initial eradication of esophageal varices. 	digestive system diseases
Intracorporeal biliary lithotripsy. Most bile duct calculi can be removed with standard percutaneous or endoscopic techniques. Very large stones are the most common cause for failure. Intracorporeal lithotripsy, and EHL in particular, can be used safely in either the biliary tree or gallbladder to fragment these large stones and allow percutaneous removal or passage. Intracorporeal EHL requires direct vision to prevent damage to the bile duct mucosa. Intracorporeal laser lithotripsy may offer some safety advantages, but the laser requires much more expensive equipment than intracorporeal EHL. Additional studies are needed to determine the technique that is better in each circumstance. 	digestive system diseases
On-table pancreatography: importance in planning operative strategy. We describe our experience with 124 on-table pancreatograms performed during 117 operative procedures on 112 patients in a wide variety of clinical settings. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) was performed on 84 occasions with a 73 per cent success rate for visualization of the main pancreatic duct. On-table pancreatography (OTP) was performed by one of five different techniques: retrograde, prograde or ambigrade ductography, cystography and ascending loopography after pancreaticojejunostomy. OTP provided important information about the main pancreatic duct when endoscopic visualization was unsuccessful (n = 23), incomplete (n = 17) or not performed (n = 33); there was a failure rate of 4 per cent. In 35 patients either the additional information or discrepancies between ERCP and OTP findings resulted in a change of operative plan (19 extra procedures, 16 altered procedures). Complete ductography was especially helpful in the 63 patients with chronic pancreatitis. OTP is technically simple, free from complications and invaluable for planning operative strategy. 	digestive system diseases
Comparison of a new immunoassay for determining serum pancreatic isoamylase with two standard techniques. A method has recently been developed for measuring serum pancreatic (P) isoamylase, using two monoclonal antibodies specific for salivary isoamylase. We performed this test on 67 healthy controls and 133 patients: 15 with acute pancreatitis, 53 with chronic pancreatitis (20 during painful relapse and 33 in clinical remission), 18 with pancreatic cancer, 41 with nonpancreatic disease with abdominal pain, five with macroamylasemia, and one with total pancreatectomy. Results were compared with those of a wheat germ inhibition method and with electrophoresis on cellulose acetate. A close correlation was found between the results of immunoinhibition assay and those of the other two tests. All patients with acute pancreatitis had abnormally high values in all three tests. In the group with chronic pancreatitis studied during painful relapse, 16 had an increase in P-isoamylase, as determined with the immunoinhibition assay, 13 with the wheat germ inhibition test, and 15 with electrophoresis. In the group with chronic pancreatitis in clinical remission, we found low values in one patient, by immunoinhibition assay, but found low values in 17 and 19 patients by wheat germ inhibition and electrophoresis, respectively. Low P-isoamylase values corresponded to a severe exocrine pancreatic insufficiency. In the group with pancreatic cancer, the three tests showed similar results, and the majority of the patients had normal values. In the patients with nonpancreatic diseases, abnormally high levels were found in five, by immunoassay, in four by electrophoresis, and in three by the wheat germ inhibition method. In the five cases with macroamylasemia, both inhibition assays erroneously demonstrated an abnormal P-isoamylase elevation. The results show that the three tests are equally useful for the diagnosis of acute pancreatitis, or chronic pancreatitis during an acute relapse. In these diseases, the immunoinhibition test would be the preferred assay because it is simple and rapidly performed. 	digestive system diseases
Bleeding from duodenal lymphangiectasia. An 8 year old girl with recurrent upper gastrointestinal bleeding was found to have localised duodenal lymphangiectasia by fibreoptic endoscopy. She did not show physical signs or laboratory evidence of significant enteric protein loss. A low fat diet seemed to prevent further bleeding. Duodenal lymphangiectasia may be associated with gastrointestinal bleeding in children. 	digestive system diseases
Corticosteroid treatment reduces mast cell numbers in inflammatory bowel disease. Mast cell degranulation in the gut causes mucus secretion, mucosal edema, and increased gut permeability and may be responsible for some of the symptoms and signs of inflammatory bowel disease. We have used a novel monoclonal antibody (AAI) against tryptase expressed exclusively in the granules of mast cells to enumerate mast cells in rectal biopsies in order to study the effect of inflammatory bowel disease and drug treatment upon rectal mast cell numbers. Rectal mast cell numbers are significantly reduced in inflammatory bowel disease patients taking corticosteroids (mean 4.95 cells/mm2) when compared with control patients (10.1, P less than 0.001) and inflammatory bowel disease patients not taking corticosteroids (9.7, P less than 0.001 Wilcoxon rank sum test). The reduction in mast cell counts was independent of the degree of inflammation or architectural distortion. There was a negative correlation between the dose of corticosteroids and mast cell count (r = 0.53, P less than 0.05 Spearman rank correlation), and the mast cell count was reduced within a few days of treatment and remained low throughout steroid therapy. Mucosal mast cell depletion may be an important mechanism of action of corticosteroids in inflammatory bowel disease. 	digestive system diseases
Controlled trial of antimycobacterial therapy in Crohn's disease. Clofazimine versus placebo. In order to study the effect of clofazimine, a powerful antimycobacterial and antiinflammatory agent, 49 patients with active Crohn's disease were randomized to either corticosteroids plus clofazimine 100 mg daily (N = 25) or to steroids and matching placebo (N = 24). A total of 28 patients (58%) went into disease remission (clofazimine 16, placebo 12; P = NS) with a fall in disease activity score from 10.5 +/- 4.4 to 3.3 +/- 3.5. Patients were treated for a further eight months with clofazimine or placebo and 18 of 28 maintained their remission and completed the study (clofazimine 12, placebo 6; P = NS). Side effects were minor and consisted of skin rash and increased pigmentation. Clofazimine as a solitary antimycobacterial agent appears ineffective in inducing remission in Crohn's disease but may have a role in either disease maintenance or combination chemotherapy. 	digestive system diseases
Pain on common bile duct injection during ERCP: does it indicate sphincter of Oddi dysfunction? The reproduction of a patient's biliary-type pain upon initial injection of contrast material into the common bile duct during diagnostic ERCP is a dramatic experience for both patient and physician. The significance of this phenomenon is not clear, but it is touted by some to be a provocative test for sphincter of Oddi dysfunction. Sphincter of Oddi manometry was performed on 224 consecutive patients referred over a 2-year period for evaluation of post-cholecystectomy syndrome and suspected sphincter of Oddi dysfunction. All patients received only intravenous diazepam as premedication for ERCP. Delayed drainage time (greater than 45 min), bile duct dilation (greater than or equal to 12 mm), and a basal sphincter of Oddi pressure of greater than 40 mm Hg (mean +/- 3 SD) were considered elevated. We observed a reproduction of pain in 15 of 224 patients (6.7%) immediately following contrast injection. There was no correlation between pain on contrast injection and elevated basal sphincter of Oddi pressure, delayed common bile duct drainage, bile duct dilation, or abnormal liver enzymes. Therefore, we feel that reproduction of the patient's biliary-type pain associated with contrast injection of ERCP is not a provocative test for sphincter of Oddi dysfunction. 	digestive system diseases
Retained intrahepatic stones: treatment with piezoelectric lithotripsy combined with stone extraction. Extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy (ESWL) was performed in 11 patients with oriental cholangiohepatitis and intrahepatic stones associated with segmented strictures of intrahepatic ducts. All patients had previously undergone biliary surgery and basket extraction via a T-tube tract at the time of lithotripsy. The indication for ESWL was failure of, or anticipated difficulty with, basket extraction of the stones via a T-tube tract. A piezoelectric lithotriptor was used in all procedures. The average total number of shock waves administered was 29,756 (range, 10,000-61,395). The average number of treatment sessions was 3.1 (range, 1-6); the number of shock waves used in a single session ranged from 10,000 to 15,000 with a frequency of five shots per second and 30%-50% power. In six patients, the stones were successfully fragmented and completely removed; in three of the others of the stones were fragmented and removed. The overall success rate, including complete (54%) and incomplete (27%) success, was 82%. Difficulty in targeting stones, and severe strictures and deformities of intrahepatic ducts, were the factors responsible for failure. No significant complications were observed. 	digestive system diseases
Biotype as determinant of natural immunising effect of cholera. To test the hypothesis that clinical Vibrio cholerae O1 infections protect against recurrent cholera, treated cholera episodes in a rural Bangladesh population of 188,153 people who were followed between 1985 and 1988 were analysed. Of the 2214 people with initial episodes of cholera, 7 had a second episode. The incidence of cholera was 61% lower in subjects who had had an earlier episode than in those without such an episode. Whereas initial episodes of classical cholera were associated with complete protection against subsequent cholera, initial episodes of El Tor cholera were associated with negligible protection. 	general pathological conditions
Efficacy and morbidity of partial laryngectomy and postoperative radiation therapy. In recent years, we have seen increasing use of partial laryngectomies for larger lesions that were previously treated by total laryngectomy. The resultant closer margins have made postoperative radiation therapy an important adjuvant treatment to conservation laryngeal surgery. We review the University of California, Los Angeles, experience with combination partial laryngectomy and postoperative radiation therapy between 1973 and 1987 for treatment of carcinoma of the larynx. Twenty-four such patients who underwent partial laryngectomies and postoperative radiation therapy are examined. Techniques of treatment, complications, and the functional ability of the remaining larynx are discussed. The locoregional control rate at 5 years was 80%. Risk factors associated with an increased risk of recurrence were positive margins, vascular invasion, and extranodal spread. There were no major problems with postoperative wound healing or airway management during the radiation treatment. Vocal and swallowing function were well preserved in most cases. We conclude that combination partial laryngectomy and radiation therapy permits preservation of laryngeal function without serious complications, and therefore is an effective treatment for selected patients with carcinoma of the larynx. 	general pathological conditions
Treatment strategies in shock: use of oxygen transport measurements. Shock has traditionally been categorized according to its cause. Shock can result from hemorrhage, primary cardiac failure, central nervous system failure, trauma, or sepsis. Therapeutic principles have been developed for each etiologic type. End points for such therapy have included optimization of pulmonary capillary wedge pressure, cardiac output, blood pressure, and urine output. Recent investigators agree that the common denominator in each of the shock syndromes is a reduction in the amount of oxygen consumed by the cell. The logical therapeutic approach would be to increase oxygen delivery to support the increased metabolic demand of the cells. The end point of resuscitation should be optimization of oxygen delivery and oxygen consumption. These variables are easily calculated by using data obtained from pulmonary artery catheter and laboratory measurements. The physician or nurse caring for critical ill patients should have a thorough understanding of the rationale for the use of oxygen transport calculations and the methods of manipulating oxygen delivery. A simple explanation of these principles including the importance of hemoglobin, cardiac index, and percent saturation of hemoglobin and suggested treatment strategies are presented. 	general pathological conditions
Effects of stress on gastric mucosal prostaglandin generation in intact, adrenalectomized, and sham-operated rats. To study the effects of (a) cold restraint stress and (b) adrenalectomy in association with cold restraint stress on gastric mucosal ulceration and prostaglandin generation, we performed two experiments. In the first, 40 rats were divided into four groups of 10 rats each: (a) unstressed and (b) stressed for 0.5 h, (c) stressed for 2 h, and (d) stressed for 4 h. In the second experiment, another 80 rats were divided into four groups of 20 rats each: (a) adrenalectomy plus cold restraint stress for 2 h, (b) adrenalectomy plus no stress, (c) sham operated plus 2 h of stress, and (d) sham operated plus no stress. In both experiments we recorded an ulcer index and measured mucosal generation of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) and prostaglandin I2 (6-keto-PGF1a). In conclusion: (a) Cold restraint stress is associated with a time-dependent decrease in gastric mucosal PGE2 generation, but no change in 6-keto-PGF1a generation, and an increase in mucosal injury that is maximal by 2 h. (b) Adrenalectomy augments the effects of stress on mucosal injury but has no effect on prostaglandin generation; thus, the ulcerogenic effect of adrenalectomy appears to be independent of an effect on prostaglandin generation. 	general pathological conditions
Rigid spine syndrome with respiratory failure. The pathogenesis and therapy of respiratory failure in the rigid spine syndrome are discussed in two cases who improved with respiratory assistance. In both cases, the partial pressures of oxygen and carbon dioxide were reversed in arterial blood gas analysis and %VC was less than 30%. Remission from respiratory failure has been obtained by the use of a ventilator during the night. The cause of the respiratory failure in both cases was severe restrictive respiratory dysfunction due to extreme flattening of the chest and fixation of the thorax during respiration as a result of contracture of costovertebral joints. All the previously reported cases of the rigid spine syndrome with respiratory failure died. Appropriate use of the ventilator can improve the prognosis. 	general pathological conditions
Full-thickness skin graft vaginoplasty for treatment of the stenotic or foreshortened vagina. Vaginal stenosis or foreshortening following surgery or radiation therapy can lead to dyspareunia. This report concerns the successful use of full-thickness skin grafts taken from the flank overlying the iliac crest to treat vaginal stenosis or foreshortening. The operation consists of incising the involved area and creating a space which will become the recipient site. An elliptical piece of full-thickness skin harvested from the area overlying the iliac crest is cleared of underlying fat, trimmed to fit the recipient site, and sutured in place. Vaginal packing is used to keep the graft against the recipient bed. Ten patients have been treated successfully with this technique, without significant complications or sequelae. Follow-up from 6 weeks to 42 months showed excellent postsurgical vaginal capacity in all patients. Similarly, excellent functional results were achieved in eight patients, with distinct improvement in the remaining two. This procedure is a useful addition to the gynecologic surgeon's armamentarium. 	general pathological conditions
Bilateral impairment of somesthetically mediated object recognition in humans Thirty adult patients (six in each of five groups--neurologically normal, lacunar infarct-related hemiparesis, unilateral thalamic lacunar infarction, right cortical infarction with mild left hemineglect, and extensive right cortical infarction with severe left hemineglect) were asked to perform various tasks that encompassed basic and intermediate somatosensory functions and tactile and visual object recognition. Patients with thalamic and cortical infarctions had severe impairment of contralateral hand-mediated somatosensory functions in all three categories of somesthetic tasks, although patients with cortical infarction were more impaired on the object recognition task than were patients with thalamic infarction. Patients with extensive damage to the right hemisphere and severe left hemineglect also had impairment of somesthetically mediated object recognition in the ipsilateral hand despite normal basic and intermediate somatosensory function and visually mediated object recognition analogous to unilateral tactile agnosia. All other groups had normal ipsilateral tactile object recognition. 	general pathological conditions
"Perinatal grief and mourning. The grief and mourning that parents experience following a perinatal loss is as devastating as the loss of an older loved one. The pattern of mourning can be anticipated and interventions can be implemented. With proper help, the parents can pass through this catastrophic time in their lives with a minimum of scars. If the physician stops, reaches out, listens, and supports the parents, he or she can have a dramatic effect on the lives of these parents. In the same manner in which we started this paper, we close with a quotation from another parent who suffered a loss: Daughters may die, But why? For even daughters can't live with half a heart. Three days isn't much a life. But long enough to remember thin blue lips, uneven gasps in incubators, Racking breaths that cause a pain to those who watched. Long enough to remember I never held her Or felt her softness Or counted her toes. I didn't even know the color of her eyes. Dead paled hands not quite covered by the gown she Was to go home in. Moist earth smell. One small casket. And the tears. You see, I hold in my hand but souvenirs of an occasion.

"Cauda equina syndrome after continuous spinal anesthesia. Four cases of cauda equina syndrome occurring after continuous spinal anesthesia are reported. In all four cases, there was evidence of a focal sensory block and, to achieve adequate analgesia, a dose of local anesthetic was given that was greater than that usually administered with a single-injection technique. We postulate that the combination of maldistribution and a relatively high dose of local anesthetic resulted in neurotoxic injury. Suggestions that may reduce the potential for neurotoxicity are discussed. Use of a lower concentration and a ""ceiling"" or maximum dose of local anesthetic to establish the block should be considered. If maldistribution of local anesthetic is suspected (as indicated by a focal sensory block), the use of maneuvers to increase the spread of local anesthetic is recommended. If such maneuvers prove unsuccessful, the technique should be abandoned. "	general pathological conditions
A preliminary report of arthroscopic findings following acute condylar trauma Standard therapy in orthopedics dictates that joints with suspected hemarthrosis be considered for irrigation or exploration, especially when immobilization is part of the treatment plan. In this preliminary report, 14 patients who had condylar/subcondylar fractures underwent superior joint space arthroscopy as part of the evaluation and treatment of their fractures. In all but two patients, blood was found in the superior joint space. Length of time from injury to time of examination correlated with the quantities of blood found. The severity and direction of the blow seemed to influence the findings in the joints. Synovial ecchymosis was a consistent finding. The disc appeared to be grossly intact and within the glenoid fossa in all cases, even when the condyle was grossly displaced. These findings raise questions about the role of direct disc injury as a source of postoperative temporomandibular joint (TMJ) symptoms, as well as about the practice of immobilization of fractures immediately after trauma. Further studies will be necessary to compare the treatment results in patients who have had arthroscopy versus those who have not. 	general pathological conditions
Epidemiology of acute respiratory tract infections among young children in Kenya. The epidemiology of acute respiratory tract infection (ARI) was investigated in a rural community 80 km north of Nairobi, Kenya. This research was conducted prospectively on 250 families with 470 children less than 5 years of age who were contacted every 8 days during the 3-year study. The yearly incidence of respiratory tract infections decreased from 5.2 to 3.4 during the study; less than 5% of these infections involved the lower respiratory tract. The incidence was inversely related to age, and the illnesses were generally mild and brief in length. Fifteen children died during the study period. The precise causes of death are unknown, but respiratory infections possibly played a role in most cases. This study emphasizes the importance of determining the risk factors responsible for unusually severe morbidity and high mortality in children with ARI in developing countries. 	general pathological conditions
Reduced allergen-induced nasal congestion and leukotriene synthesis with an orally active 5-lipoxygenase inhibitor BACKGROUND AND METHODS. The clinical importance of leukotrienes in human allergy has not been defined, in part because there have been no selective 5-lipoxygenase inhibitors that have been effective and safe for use in humans. To address the hypothesis that stimulated leukotriene synthesis causes symptoms of immediate-hypersensitivity reactions in vivo, I investigated the effects of a new 5-lipoxygenase inhibitor, A-64077, on provoked allergic nasal symptoms and mediator release in a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study. Eight subjects with allergic rhinitis underwent nasal challenge on two occasions after an oral dose of 800 mg of A-64077 or an identical-appearing placebo. RESULTS. Allergen-induced nasal congestion was significantly attenuated (P less than 0.02) by A-64077; peak levels of leukotriene B4 (median, 684 pg per milliliter) and 5-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (median, 704 pg per milliliter) in nasal-rinse fluids were markedly reduced (to 67 and 185 pg per milliliter, respectively; P less than 0.01), whereas levels of prostaglandin D2 were not. Histamine release and sneezing were not reduced significantly by A-64077, but there was a significant correlation (P less than 0.01) between the changes in these variables within subjects. The mean (+/- SEM) stimulated synthesis of leukotriene B4 in whole blood ex vivo was markedly reduced by A-64077 (from 153 +/- 19 to 20 +/- 9 ng per milliliter, P less than 0.01), and the specificity of A-64077 for 5-lipoxygenase inhibition was verified by its lack of effect on the synthesis of serum thromboxane B2 or 12-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid. CONCLUSIONS. These results provide direct evidence of an important role for the 5-lipoxygenase products of arachidonic acid in allergic rhinitis and support the notion that further experiments in this area may lead to new therapeutic approaches to allergic disorders. 	general pathological conditions
Radiographic identification by mastoid sinus and arterial pattern. A skull and some incomplete postcranial remains were discovered in two searches over a two-month period near Santa Fe, New Mexico. The discoveries could be demonstrated to be from the same person, and the remains were shown to be consistent with a specific missing person on the basis of anthropological analysis. Further work led to a positive identification on multiple grounds, including agreement of the details of the mastoid sinus and endocranial arterial patterns observed radiographically. These features may be useful for establishing positive identification from skeletal remains when antemortem radiographic studies for comparison are limited to lateral cranial vault studies. 	general pathological conditions

We report the skin manifestations of three siblings with CDLG in which areas of skin necrosis occurred that resembled pyoderma gangrenosum. 	general pathological conditions
Sudden cardiac death during exercise in a weight lifter using anabolic androgenic steroids: pathological and toxicological findings. A 21-year-old, previously healthy weight lifter collapsed during a bench press workout. He had taken anabolic androgenic steroids parenterally for the previous several months. Pertinent autopsy findings included marked cardiac and renal hypertrophy and hepatosplenomegaly, with regional myocardial fibrosis and focal myocardial necrosis. Nandrolone (19-nor-testosterone) metabolites were identified in postmortem urine. The possible etiologies of the cardiac findings are discussed. 	general pathological conditions
The radiologic morphology of painful temporomandibular joints. A high frequency of remodeling changes was demonstrated radiographically in a series of patients having pain in the temporomandibular joint region. Radiologic morphologic differences between painful and asymptomatic temporomandibular joints were in frequency rather than type. Caution should be taken not to overestimate the significance of radiologic abnormality in patients with pain in the temporomandibular joint region. 	general pathological conditions
A placebo-controlled trial of maintenance therapy with fluconazole after treatment of cryptococcal meningitis in the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. California Collaborative Treatment Group. BACKGROUND AND METHODS. In patients with the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), the rate of relapse after primary treatment for cryptococcal meningitis remains high. We conducted a controlled, double-blind trial to evaluate the efficacy of maintenance therapy with fluconazole. At entry into the study, all participants had sterile cultures of cerebrospinal fluid, blood, and urine after following a standardized course of therapy for culture-proved cryptococcal meningitis. The patients were randomly assigned to take either fluconazole or placebo as maintenance therapy. The dose of fluconazole was 100 mg daily in the first phase of study and 200 mg daily in the second phase. RESULTS. Of 84 patients initially enrolled, 16 (19 percent) were found to have silent, persistent infection on the basis of cultures that became positive after entry into the study; 7 other patients were lost to follow-up shortly after entry. Of the remaining 61 patients, 10 of 27 assigned to placebo (37 percent) and 1 of 34 assigned to fluconazole (3 percent) had a recurrence of cryptococcal infection at any site (difference in risk, 34 percent; 95 percent confidence interval, 15 to 53). Of the 11 recurrent infections, 7 were detected in urine obtained after prostatic massage. There were four recurrent meningeal infections in the patients taking placebo, but none in those taking fluconazole (mean duration of follow-up, 164 days) (P = 0.03). In multivariate analyses, the best predictors of recurrence-free survival were fluconazole treatment (P = 0.02; relative hazard, 13.2), a lower serum cryptococcal-antigen titer (P = 0.05; relative hazard, 1.2), and more prolonged primary therapy with flucytosine (P = 0.09; relative hazard, 1.1). Survival and toxicity were similar in the two maintenance-treatment groups. CONCLUSIONS. In patients with AIDS, silent persistent infection is common after clinically successful treatment for cryptococcal meningitis. Maintenance therapy with fluconazole is highly effective in preventing recurrent cryptococcal infection. 	general pathological conditions
Treatment of condyloma acuminatum with three different interferon-alpha preparations administered parenterally: a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. One hundred seventy-eight patients were enrolled in a placebo-controlled trial to evaluate three interferon-alpha preparations administered parenterally for the treatment of condyloma acuminatum. When all interferon groups were combined and compared with placebo, interferon recipients had greater rates of complete, 75%, 50%, and 25% lesion resolution than did placebo recipients (P = .21, P = .14, P = .02, and P = .02, respectively). Rates of lesion resolution were higher among women than among men, and women were more likely than men to respond to interferon. Virologic measurements in paired lesion biopsies did not correlate with interferon treatment or disease outcome. Although interferon toxicity was observed frequently, no participant withdrew from the study because of side effects, and dosage alterations were not required. Parenterally administered interferon-alpha is more effective than placebo in treating condyloma acuminatum, although rates of complete response are low. Different regimens, including combination therapy, should be evaluated for treatment of this common sexually transmitted disease. 	general pathological conditions
Peripheral nerve function in sepsis and multiple organ failure Forty-three patients who had sepsis and multiple organ failure (critical illness) were studied prospectively to determine the incidence and severity of peripheral nerve function and to correlate such function with a number of variables. Electrophysiologic studies indicated a primary axonal degeneration of motor and sensory fibers in 30 (70 percent). Fifteen (30 percent) had the clinical signs of difficulty in weaning from assisted ventilation, weakness of limb muscles, and reduced or absent deep tendon reflexes. Full recovery from the polyneuropathy occurred among the 23 (53 percent) who survived, except three who had a very severe polyneuropathy. A peripheral nerve function index, computed from electrophysiologic measurements, showed statistically significant (p less than 0.01) negative correlations with the time in the critical care unit, and the serum glucose value; the serum albumin level showed a positive correlation. Multiple regression analyses indicated all three factors accounted for 47 percent (r2 = 0.4678) of all potential variables. In a separate analysis, the nerve function index correlated with the amplitude of the diaphragm compound muscle action potential (p less than 0.01). The results were consistent with the polyneuropathy being due to the same mechanisms that are currently postulated to cause dysfunction in this syndrome of other organ systems (including the neuromuscular respiratory system). 	general pathological conditions
Diaphragmatic fatigue produced by constant or modulated electric currents. In anesthetized rabbits the efficiency of phrenic nerve stimulation with trains of electric current was studied either when ventilation was effected entirely by bilateral nerve stimulation (electrophrenic ventilation) or during unilateral nerve stimulation when animals were ventilated with a pump and open chest. Trains of rectangular electric pulses (RPT) with constant amplitude and frequency or sine waves, both the amplitude and frequency of which were modulated and controlled by a computer (MSWT), were used with each animal. MSWT closely reproduced the physiological shape of transdiaphragmatic pressure waves. Diaphragm fatigue, as determined from the decrease in the maximal relaxation rate of twitches, occurred after 20 minutes of bilateral or unilateral nerve stimulation with RPT, but only after 60 min (unilateral stimulation) or 98 min (bilateral stimulation) with MSWT. These data show the importance of the motor signal pattern in long-lasting nerve stimulation. 	general pathological conditions
Long-term effect of dopaminergic drugs in restless legs. A 2-year follow-up. Thirty patients with restless legs syndrome, who initially had all responded well to treatment with levodopa and benserazide, were studied as to the long-term effect of the drugs (at least 2 years). During the 2-year period, two patients were switched from levodopa to bromocriptine. Two patients no longer needed levodopa; one of them had developed paraplegia and in the other the symptoms of restless legs syndrome had disappeared completely. The remaining 26 patients continued to use levodopa. Eight patients maintained the original dose, nine had to use an increased dose, and nine found a decreased dose to be sufficient. The only side effect was transient nausea reported by two of the 30 patients. The study showed that the relief of symptoms of restless legs syndrome by dopaminergic drugs does not wear off with the passage of time, that side effects are minimal even with long-term use, and that the dose needed to obtain relief may increase as well as decrease. 	general pathological conditions
Intrathoracic Nissen fundoplication: long-term clinical and pH-monitoring evaluation. From 1976 until April 1989, 31 intrathoracic total fundoplications were performed for reflux esophagitis and irreducible hiatus hernia. In the first 16 patients (group 1) the operation was complicated with acute perforation of the wrap in 4 cases, bronchogastric fistula in 1, and herniation of the wrap higher in the chest in 1. Technical modifications were applied to 15 more recent patients (group 2). These are enlargement of the hiatus, looseness of the wrap and its appropriate anchorage, avoidance of forceps when handling the stomach, care with the vagi, and efficient gastric decompression in the postoperative period. The postoperative course was always uneventful in group 2. Twenty-six patients, who still have their initial wrap, were considered for clinical evaluation: 11 from group 1 (mean follow-up, 81.5 months) and 15 from group 2 (mean follow-up, 32.8 months). All are free from any symptom of reflux; gas-bloat syndrome is infrequent and dysphagia is relieved. Twenty-four-hour pH monitoring, performed in 14 patients (3 from group 1 and 11 from group 2) (mean follow-up, 42 months), was normal in 13; a pathological upright reflux (time pH less than 4, 8.4%) was demonstrated in one symptom-free woman in whom endoscopy was unremarkable. Mechanisms of complications experienced in group 1 are analyzed in the light of the technical evolution of the procedure, and the place of the intrathoracic total fundoplication in the management of short esophagus is defined, considering the other available surgical techniques. 	general pathological conditions
Hospital setting and fetal death during labor among women at low risk. Intrapartum fetal death in low-risk women at term is a rare obstetric outcome. This is difficult to study because few data sets contain an adequate number of cases for meaningful analysis. This study used data from the 1980 National Natality Survey and National Fetal Mortality Survey, merged with an American Hospital Association annual survey for the same year, to determine whether the frequency of intrapartum fetal death in low-risk women varied by the hospital setting for birth. Stratified analysis was used to assess the relation of level of hospital for delivery with intrapartum fetal death, with control for potential confounding factors. As the level of available perinatal technology decreased, the frequency of intrapartum fetal death increased (odds ratio, 2.0 for Level II and 3.3 for Level I, as compared with Level III hospitals). Even when early neonatal deaths were considered, perinatal mortality remained lowest at Level III facilities (odds ratio, 1.6 for Level II and 2.7 for Level I, as compared with Level III hospitals). The components of intrapartum surveillance that are most effective in the reduction of perinatal mortality have not been identified. 	general pathological conditions
Periapical lesions of mandibular bone: difficulties in early diagnostics. It is often difficult to establish a correct diagnosis on the basis of initial clinical and roentgenologic symptoms in mandibular bone disease. In this paper these problems are discussed, and some suggestions are made to overcome them. The discussion is based on cases of osteogenic sarcoma, histiocytic lymphoma, and chronic osteomyelitis. The patients were a boy and two middle-aged women, all of them with primary clinical symptoms of pain and swelling, diffuse roentgenologic changes in mandibular bone, uncertain response to treatment, and an unusual progress of the disease. 	general pathological conditions
Spinal narcotics for postoperative analgesia in total joint arthroplasty. A prospective study. Sixty patients who were scheduled to have an elective total hip or knee arthroplasty were randomly assigned to one of three groups of twenty patients each before operation with spinal anesthesia. A double-blind technique was used throughout the study. The patients in Group I (control group) received hyperbaric 1 per cent tetracaine with epinephrine as the subarachnoid spinal anesthetic; the patients in Group II (morphine group), hyperbaric 1 per cent tetracaine with epinephrine and a single subarachnoid dose of Duramorph (morphine sulphate), 0.5 milligram; and those in Group III (Dilaudid group), hyperbaric 1 per cent tetracaine with epinephrine and a single subarachnoid dose of Dilaudid (hydromorphone hydrochloride), 0.002 milligram per kilogram of body weight. During the first twenty-four hours after the operation, the patients in Group II and Group III had significantly less pain compared with those in Group I. This was shown by the use of a visual linear-analog pain scale (p less than 0.05), the patients' ratings of the quality of relief of pain (p less than 0.02), and comparative measurements of the pain-altering medications that were used (p less than 0.05). The patients in Group II and Group III did not have any more complications or side effects than those in Group I. There was no significant difference in the quality and duration of analgesia between Group II and Group III. 	general pathological conditions
Neutrophil influx into an inflammatory site inhibited by a soluble homing receptor-IgG chimaera. Neutrophil-mediated inflammation is involved in a number of human clinical manifestations, including the adult respiratory distress syndrome, multi-organ failure and reperfusion injury. One way of inhibiting this type of inflammatory response would be to block competitively the adhesive interactions between neutrophils and the endothelium adjacent to the inflamed region. The lectin-containing murine adhesion molecule gp90MEL, the homing receptor, is found on all leukocytic cells, including neutrophils. MEL 14, a monoclonal antibody directed against this adhesion molecule, blocks lymphocyte traffic to lymph nodes and extravasation of neutrophils from blood to inflammatory sites. Here we show that administration to mice of a soluble immunoglobulin chimaera containing the murine homing receptor extracellular domain significantly decreases the number of neutrophils that migrate to the peritoneum in response to the inflammatory irritant thioglycollate. These results indicate that soluble forms of a single type of adhesion molecule, the homing receptor, could be clinically effective compounds for the inhibition of neutrophil-mediated inflammation. 	general pathological conditions
Complete jejunoileal necrosis due to torsion of the superior mesenteric artery.

This case was unusual not only because of the extent of necrosis but also because primary small-bowel volvulus is rare in adults. Despite nearly total small-bowel resection, the patient continues to do well 6 months postoperatively. 	general pathological conditions
Fetal choroid plexus cysts: a prospective study and review of the literature. To determine the incidence and significance of fetal choroid plexus cysts, a prospective study was carried out at Queen's Medical Centre, Nottingham. The incidence of cysts was found to be 0.42% and the size of cysts varied from 3 to 13 mm with a mean diameter of 6.2 mm. Choroid plexus cysts were associated with other fetal abnormalities in three cases, two of which were subsequently found to have a chromosomal abnormality, one Trisomy 18 and one Trisomy 21. A review of the reported cases of choroid plexus cysts reveals an overall incidence of 5.8% for Trisomy 18. We therefore recommend that in patients with choroid plexus cysts a detailed scan should be carried out to look for the ultrasound markers of Trisomy 18. If there is an associated abnormality or cysts are large (13 mm or greater in diameter) and bilateral then a karyotyping should be carried out. 	general pathological conditions
"The perception of life events and daily stress in nonulcer dyspepsia. Previous studies on the association of nonulcer dyspepsia with major life events were performed without emphasis on the perception of these events, and have yielded conflicting results. The present study examined the perception of life events and, in addition, the role of daily ""hassles"" (stressful events) in patients with nonulcer dyspepsia. Thirty-three dyspeptic patients as defined by normal endoscopy and ultrasonogram and 33 controls of comparable sex, age, and social class were recruited for study. Both groups were asked to select from 56 major life events those they had experienced and to give a rating on how they perceived them. They were further asked to select similarly from 117 items of daily stress and to rate the severity of each item. The results demonstrated that the number of positive and negative events and the positive score were similar in both dyspeptic patients and controls, but dyspeptic patients had a higher perceived magnitude of negative events and a higher score of total life change as given by the summation of magnitude of positive and negative events (both p less than 0.05). The ""hassles"" scores were not significantly different between dyspeptic patients and controls. Analysis of individual life events revealed that dyspeptic patients had significantly (p less than 0.05) higher scores than controls in items of minor law violations, major change in closeness of family members, and major personal illness or injury. We conclude that patients with nonulcer dyspepsia have higher negative perception of major life events, which indicates that psychological factors may play a role in the pathogenesis of nonulcer dyspepsia.

Acute experimental allergic encephalomyelitis in SJL/J mice induced by a synthetic peptide of myelin proteolipid protein. Clinical, histologic, and ultrastructural characteristics of acute experimental allergic encephalomyelitis (EAE) induced by sensitization with a synthetic peptide corresponding to mouse myelin proteolipid protein (PLP) residues 139-151 HCLGKWLGHPDKF were studied in SJL/J mice. Groups of mice were immunized with 20, 50, or 100 nmol of the peptide and were killed from seven to 28 days after sensitization or when they were moribund. Beginning on Day 9, the mice showed signs of EAE and the disease progressed rapidly to paralysis. Central nervous system (CNS) inflammation, edema, gliosis, and demyelination were found in all mice killed between Days 10 and 28 and white matter lesion areas correlated with clinical score at the time the mice were killed. Peripheral nerve roots and the cauda equina did not have lesions. Within the range studied, the severity of clinical or histologic disease was the same regardless of the PLP peptide dose. Two of ten mice immunized with 100 nmol and none of 14 mice given smaller doses of a synthetic peptide of mouse myelin basic protein (MBP) showed clinical EAE. These mice had small numbers of CNS lesions that were indistinguishable from those in PLP peptide-sensitized mice. These findings demonstrate that immunization of SJL/J mice with PLP peptide 139-151 produces a disease with the clinical and morphologic features of CNS tissue-, whole PLP-, whole MBP-, and MBP peptide-induced acute EAE. Thus, PLP is a major encephalitogen and immune reactions to epitopes of different myelin proteins may induce identical patterns of injury in the CNS. 	general pathological conditions
Awareness during caesarean section. Between 1982 and 1989 over 3000 patients were questioned about recall and dreaming after general anaesthesia for Caesarean section. Some 28 (0.9%) patients were able to recall something of their operation and 189 (6.1%) reported dreams. There was uniform adherence to a rigid anaesthetic protocol up to and including 1985, but a much publicized incident reported from the courtroom stimulated a relaxation of this regimen. Consequently the incidence of awareness decreased from 1.3% to 0.4%, and the incidence of dreaming was also reduced. Recollections of surgery were confined to manipulations, noises and voices. None of our patients complained of pain at the time of interview, although one since has. The inadequacies of the initial protocol and an approach to informed consent are discussed. 	general pathological conditions
Complications of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation in neonates. In cases of severe respiratory failure, cardiopulmonary bypass has been used as support until cardiac and pulmonary recovery occurs. We report the Wilford Hall USAF Medical Center experience with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) and its associated complications. From July 1985 to March 1989, 57 neonates were placed on membrane oxygenators. The overall survival was 79%. Technical complications encountered included catheter-related problems, mechanical complications of the pump apparatus, and hemorrhage. Hemorrhagic complications were the most frequent and devastating complications encountered. Intracranial hemorrhage accounted for six deaths associated with bypass. Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation is successful in significantly improving survival of neonates whose predicted mortality approaches 100% with conventional treatment. The rate of infant mortality using the membrane oxygenator is not affected by technical complications related to catheter position, mechanical problems with the circuit, or hemorrhage, excluding intracranial hemorrhage. The major cause of death of infants receiving extracorporeal membrane oxygenation is the underlying disease process leading to cardiopulmonary failure. 	general pathological conditions
Nasal augmentation with split calvarial grafts in Orientals. This study reports on my experience with autogenous split calvarial grafts in nasal augmentation in 62 Orientals. In 78 percent of patients, the procedure was performed under local anesthesia in an outpatient setting. Total operating time for harvesting of split calvarial grafts ranged from 20 to 55 minutes, with a mean of 32 minutes. Patients ranged in age from 16 to 48 years, with a mean of 27 years. Follow-up was from 6 months to 8 years, with an average of 3.1 years. Intraoperative discomfort was uniformly low and well tolerated when local anesthesia was used. The complication rate was 8.0 percent, with three cases of minor seroma-hematoma formation at the bone-graft donor site. These were treated with aspiration. There were two recipient-site complications, with one case of complete bone resorption that occurred in a densely fibrotic nose with preexisting septal perforation and a case of overcorrection that was successfully rasped 1 year later. Because of their easy accessibility beneath the scalp, split calvarial grafts to the nose are useful in various types of nasal augmentation, and the technique is offered as a practical alternative to the use of alloplastic materials. 	general pathological conditions
Racial differences in cerebrovascular disease hospitalizations. We studied the relationship of race to incidence of hospitalization for cerebrovascular disease among 74,096 white and 33,041 black persons who took health examinations in a prepaid health care program. Analyses were controlled for age, sex, body mass index, coffee use, smoking, alcohol use, systolic blood pressure, and baseline disease. Blacks were at higher hospitalization risk than whites for hemorrhagic cerebrovascular disease (relative risk = 2.4, 95% confidence interval = 1.3-5.8), cerebral thrombosis (relative risk = 1.9, 95% confidence interval = 1.2-2.9), and nonspecific cerebrovascular disease (relative risk = 1.6, 95% confidence interval = 1.2-2.2) but at lower hospitalization risk for extracranial occlusive disease (relative risk = 0.4, 95% confidence interval = 0.2-0.7). Blood pressure had a similar relation to all types of cerebrovascular disease in both races, but there were disparities in the relations of other atherosclerosis risk factors to different types of cerebrovascular disease. Educational attainment had little relation to hospitalization for extracranial occlusive disease, a finding that reduces the likelihood that selection bias explains the racial disparity. These data show unexplained racial differences in the type and location of cerebrovascular disease. The differences are important in understanding the pathogenesis of cerebrovascular disease and have practical clinical implications. 	nervous system diseases
Attitudes of major employers toward the employment of people with epilepsy: a 30-year study. Beginning in 1956, major San Francisco Bay area employers were sampled at 10-year intervals for a 30-year period to assess attitudes toward the employment of epileptic workers. In this time, we documented a trend of sustained positive change that appears to validate the efforts of organizations that have focused on raising public awareness of this disorder. 	nervous system diseases
Analgesic use: a study of treatments used by patients for migraine prior to attending the City of London Migraine Clinic. Eighty-three unselected patients attending the City of London Migraine Clinic for the first time were asked about their drug intake and use of alternative treatment. Thirty-one of those questioned took regular daily doses of medication. Fifteen were taking a combination of drugs bought 'over the counter' (OTC) and drugs prescribed by their GP; eleven took OTC drugs only; and 5 took prescription drugs only. It was noticeable that those taking drugs prescribed both by the GP and obtainable over the counter were more likely than the other groups to be taking several drugs rather than a single type. Thirty five of the 83 (42.2%) had tried alternative treatments for their attacks. 	nervous system diseases
"Postischemic (S)-emopamil therapy ameliorates focal ischemic brain injury in rats. (S)-Emopamil is a calcium channel blocker of the phenylalkylamine class, having potent serotonin S2 antagonistic properties and high blood-brain barrier penetrability. Previous studies have documented cerebroprotective effect in animal models of both focal and global ischemia. The present study was undertaken to define the postischemic ""window"" of therapeutic efficacy for this agent. Sprague-Dawley rats were subjected to permanent proximal middle cerebral artery occlusion, combined with an initial 30-minute period of halothane-induced hypotension (50 mm Hg). (S)-Emopamil (20 mg/kg) was administered intraperitoneally either 20-30 minutes prior to middle cerebral artery occlusion or 1 hour, 2 hours, or 3 hours following occlusion. Treated groups received a second similar dose 2.5 hours later and twice daily for 2 days thereafter. Brains were perfusion-fixed on the third day. Planimetric analysis of hemotoxylin and eosin-stained coronal brain sections documented a cortical infarct averaging 72.9 +/- 33.3 mm3 (mean +/- SD) in untreated rats. Cortical infarct volume was reduced by 48% (to 37.6 +/- 27.6 mm3) when therapy was initiated 1 hour postischemia (p less than 0.05). When treatment was deferred to 2 hours postichemia, mean cortical infarct volume was reduced by 34%, but this difference did not attain statistical significance. Infarct volume in rats with treatment initiated at 3 hours postischemia was indistinguishable from that in controls. Striatal infarct volume was similar in all groups. These results document a postischemic therapeutic window of cerebroprotection for (S)-emopamil lying between 1 and 2 hours after middle cerebral artery occlusion. "	nervous system diseases
The epilepsies: clinical implications of the international classification. From the earliest days of neurology, the classification of epileptic seizures into those generalized from the beginning and those with a definable localization in the cortex from the onset has added to knowledge about the function of the nervous system. Further elaboration of the classification of seizures into those localized to the six-layered isocortex and those whose elaboration involves regions of the brain involved with consciousness and memory has provided the basic focus for the burgeoning subspecialty of epilepsy surgery. It is increasingly apparent that the etiology of a seizure disorder is of at least equal or of greater significance than the nature of the seizures it spawns and is the product not only of localization in the nervous system but also of causative factors with implications reaching into areas of genetics, higher cortical function, and intelligence. The prognosis concerning the outcome of the epilepsy under consideration is based on all of these facets. This pathophysiological substratum, of which the seizure is only the presenting symptom, constitutes the epilepsy or epileptic syndrome on which the formulation of a rational treatment plan is based. 	nervous system diseases
HLA class II antigens and DNA restriction fragment length polymorphism in myasthenia gravis in Japan. Human leukocyte phenotypes and genes in the HLA class II regions were studied in 46 Japanese patients with myasthenia gravis. When the HLA phenotypes of the patients with myasthenia gravis were compared with the controls, an increased frequency of HLA-DRw53 was observed in females less than 30 years of age. The genomic DNAs of the HLA-DRw53-positive patients and DRw53-positive controls were analyzed by using four complementary DNA probes for HLA class II genes. With DQB complementary DNA as the probe, a higher incidence of the 6.5-kb or 8.2-kb BamHI fragment was observed in the patients (76.0%) compared with the controls (19.0%). In contrast, no significant difference was observed between patients and controls when complementary DNAs for DRB, DQA, and DPB were used as probes. These results indicate that the genetic background of Japanese females with early-onset myasthenia gravis is different from other patients with myasthenia gravis, and that DQB genes can greatly influence the onset of myasthenia gravis. 	nervous system diseases
Actigraphic home-monitoring sleep-disturbed and control infants and young children: a new method for pediatric assessment of sleep-wake patterns. Two studies were conducted to evaluate actigraphic home-monitoring for the assessment of infants' and children's sleep patterns. In the first study, 11 children (aged 12 to 48 months) were monitored in the laboratory by traditional polysomnography and by actigraphy for one night. Actigraphic automatic sleep-wake scorings were compared with those of the polysomnograph; total agreement rate was 85.3%. In the second study, sleep patterns of 63 sleep-disturbed and 34 control healthy children (aged 9 to 27 months) were compared. These children were home-monitored by actigraph for a mean of 4.45 nights (total 482 nights). Actigraphic data were analyzed by an automated scoring procedure. Sleep quality of the sleep-disturbed children, measured by actigraphically derived sleep percent and number of longer-than-5-minute wakings, was significantly lower than that of the control subjects (P less than .0001). Sleep measures showed significant night-to-night stability in both groups. The stability of specific measures and their age trends were different between the groups. Actigraphic sleep measures alone could discriminate between sleep-disturbed and control children with a highly correct assignment rate of 79.4% and 91.2%, respectively. 	nervous system diseases
Histochemical demonstration of 5'-nucleotidase activity in inflammatory muscle disease. Using a histochemical method, 5'-nucleotidase activity was investigated in 80 muscle biopsy specimens, including specimens from eight patients with muscular dystrophy, 18 with nonspecific type II fiber atrophy, 15 with polymyositis, and 29 histologically normal controls. An interstitial reaction for 5'-nucleotidase was associated with an inflammatory infiltrate in 19 of 21 positive cases. Of the 15 cases of polymyositis, 14 showed an extensive interstitial reaction surrounding most of the myofibers and extending well away from the areas infiltrated by inflammatory cells. The extensive nature of this reaction makes 5'-nucleotidase activity a useful adjuvant in the diagnosis of inflammatory muscle disease. 	nervous system diseases
Trends in systolic blood pressure, 24-hour sodium excretion, and stroke mortality in the elderly in Belgium. Data from six surveys of systolic blood pressure conducted in Belgium between 1967 and 1986 were analyzed. The mean ages of the six groups of 3,328 subjects ranged from 70 to 81 years. The prevalence of systolic blood pressure levels above 159 mm Hg decreased between 1967 and 1986 from 51% to 21% in men and 66% to 22% in women; severe hypertension (systolic blood pressure greater than 220 mm Hg) nearly disappeared. During the same period, body mass index increased 1.1 kg/m2 in men and was unchanged in women; mean systolic blood pressure decreased from 159 to 142 mm Hg in men and from 171 to 147 mm Hg in women; the proportion of subjects receiving treatment for hypertension increased from 10% to 36% in men and from 18% to 41% in women; and the mean standardized 24-hour sodium excretion decreased from 265 to 188 mmol in men and from 208 to 160 mmol in women. Systolic blood pressure levels were significantly and independently related to sodium excretion in the 1967 and 1972 studies. The decrease in systolic blood pressure in Belgium was influenced by the combined effects of more and better treatment for hypertension and a decrease in sodium intake. 	nervous system diseases
Progression of diabetic autonomic neuropathy over a decade in insulin-dependent diabetics. The prognosis for diabetics with autonomic neuropathy is little known. We therefore studied the progress of young insulin-dependent diabetics, first identified as having abnormal autonomic function 10-15 years ago. We have shown that the mortality of diabetics with symptomatic autonomic neuropathy is increased, but is less than previously reported. Mortality in asymptomatic diabetics with an isolated abnormality in autonomic function tests is not increased. The heart rate variability declines at 1.02 +/- 0.47 (SD) per annum in diabetics with an initially normal heart rate variability. While symptoms of autonomic neuropathy do not usually remit even over a decade, they do not commonly progress. Three groups of young insulin-dependent diabetics had heart rate variability tested between 1972 and 1977 and have been reviewed 10-15 years later. Group A (n = 49) had symptomatic autonomic neuropathy and an abnormal heart rate variability (less than 12), Group B (n = 24) were asymptomatic yet had an abnormal heart rate variability and Group C (n = 38) were asymptomatic and had a normal heart rate variability (16-26). The 10-year survival in Group A (73.4 per cent) was less (P less than 0.05) than in Groups B (91.7 per cent) or C (89.5 per cent) which did not differ from each other. The 18 Group A deaths were due predominantly to renal failure (n = 4), myocardial infarction in patients with nephropathy (n = 3) and sudden unexpected death (n = 3). The chief symptoms of autonomic neuropathy--diarrhoea, postural hypotension and gustatory sweating, were very persistent but did not necessarily deteriorate or become disabling in the majority of patients. The development of autonomic symptoms in asymptomatic patients with abnormal heart rate variability was uncommon over a decade. 	nervous system diseases
Effect of cardiac output reduction on rate of desaturation in obstructive apnea. The nadir of SaO2 during an obstructive apnea is dependent upon the apnea's duration and the rate of fall of saturation (dSaO2/dt). We postulated that a low Q, such as in patients with congestive heart failure with sleep apnea, or a reduction in Q, as seen in some humans during obstructive sleep apnea, might steepen dSaO2/dt. The mechanism postulated was lowering of SvO2 with increased pulmonary capillary blood oxygen uptake and faster depletion of alveolar oxygen. This study examines dSaO2/dt following the onset of apnea in eight spontaneously breathing adult baboons. Nonrepetitive obstructive apneas (30, 45, and 60 seconds) were created by clamping an indwelling cuffed endotracheal tube at the end of expiration. Following baseline measurements, the animals were given a bolus of a rapid-acting beta-adrenergic blocker followed by continuous infusion to reduce cardiac output and to limit the cardiovascular response to obstructive asphyxia. Fiberoptic catheters were used for continuous monitoring of SaO2, SvO2, and cardiac output. Esophageal pressure and relative thoracic gas volume (Respitrace) were monitored to insure equivalence of lung volume at the onset of apnea. Beta-adrenergic blockade reduced resting Q by a mean of 25 percent. The blocked vs unblocked dSaO2/dt was 0.73 vs 0.72 percent/s, 0.76 vs 0.73 percent/s, and 0.70 vs 0.71 percent/s for 30-second, 45-second, and 60-second apneas, respectively. Thus, mean dSaO2/dt for all durations of apneas was unaffected by beta-adrenergic blockade. We concluded that dSaO2/dt is not influenced by limited Q preceding or induced by obstructive asphyxia. 	nervous system diseases
An open trial of high-dosage antioxidants in early Parkinson's disease. High dosages of tocopherol and ascorbate were administered to patients with early Parkinson's disease as a preliminary open-labeled trial for the eventual controlled double-blind study evaluating antioxidants as a test of the endogenous toxin hypothesis of the etiology of Parkinson's disease. The primary endpoint of the trial was the need to treat patients with levodopa. The time when levodopa became necessary in the treated patients was compared with another group of patients followed elsewhere and not taking antioxidants. The time when levodopa became necessary was extended by 2.5 y in the group taking antioxidants. The results of this pilot study suggest that the progression of Parkinson's disease may be slowed by the administration of these antioxidants. A large multicenter, controlled clinical trial currently underway in North America evaluating tocopherol and deprenyl has the potential to confirm these results. 	nervous system diseases
