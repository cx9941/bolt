"Have you taken the road less traveled, and has it made all the difference? . Robert Frost (1874–1963).  Mountain Interval.  1920.\n \n1. The Road Not Taken\n \n \nTWO roads diverged in a yellow wood,\nAnd sorry I could not travel both\nAnd be one traveler, long I stood\nAnd looked down one as far as I could\nTo where it bent in the undergrowth;        5\n \nThen took the other, as just as fair,\nAnd having perhaps the better claim,\nBecause it was grassy and wanted wear;\nThough as for that the passing there\nHad worn them really about the same,        10\n \nAnd both that morning equally lay\nIn leaves no step had trodden black.\nOh, I kept the first for another day!\nYet knowing how way leads on to way,\nI doubted if I should ever come back.        15\n \nI shall be telling this with a sigh\nSomewhere ages and ages hence:\nTwo roads diverged in a wood, and I—\nI took the one less traveled by,\nAnd that has made all the difference.        20 . I guess I don't buy Frosts idea of a neatly forked road.  I think life is a lot more like a series of squiggly lines then two neat paths.  Sometimes I've traveled the path less choosen, sometimes I've choosen the more common path.  Sometimes I've just said ""screw this"", grabbed a machette and cut my own way through the woods.\n\nWhat matters to me is not that I have traveled the ""popular"" or ""unpopular"" path, but that I have traveled my path.  It has had pitfalls and moments of perfection, but more then that, it is MINE and no one can ever take it from me."	Society & Culture

i want to reduce my thight size and increase my height...what should i do? . which diet should i choose?...is it hi-fibre . Increasing your height is impossible unless you are still a growing child/ young adult. Generally, we stop growing around the age of 21, though occasional growth spurts have been reported in older people. But they can't be controled I'm afraid! \n\nHow about high heels? They lengthen the legs and make your legs look slimmer! \n\nWith regards to thigh size, just eat in moderation, and do leg exercises. A great one is to lie on your back, hold your legs in the air above you (straight, at about 45 degrees from the ground) and open and close them.	Health

"general mechanism of action and routes of adminestration of Local Anaestheasia? .  . There are several theories put forward by which a local anesthetic  agent works. The commonly accepted theory is the ""Specific Receptor Theory"".. The local anesthetic agent binds to certain receptors on the cell membrane and exert their action.The sequence of action are as follows:\n * Displacement of calcium ions from nerve receptor site..\n * Binding of local anesthetic molecule to this receptor site..\n * Blockade of sodium channel.\n * Decrease in sodium conduction.\n * Depression of rate of electrical depolarization.\n * Failure to achieve threshold potential level.\n * Lack of development of propagated action potential.\n * Conduction blockade.\n  \n   As for as the routes are concerned, LA can be given as:\n * topical application.\n * infiltration under the skin or mucous membrane to block peripheral nerves.\n * intramuscular to block a nerve, e.g. mandibular nerve   block for extraction of lower molars.\n * intrathecal ( into the spinal cavity), e.g.as in cesarean section."

"Is it wrong to teach creationism in schools? . Some scientists are beginning to believe in creationism because all the facts of the 'big bang' theory and others, do not add up (my mom is a science teacher, please don't base your argument on saying all scientists believe this.)  If no human who is on earth today was around to witness the beginning of life, then why do we not teach all theories involving it?  Because, that is what most of science is, theories, which are not provable, and laws, which are 'concrete', but still sometimes change as we discover new things.  Is not teaching our children all the possibilities insulting their intelligence and not allowing them to make an informed decision about what they want to believe? . The more important question is ""isn't it wrong to teach evolution in school.""  \n\nSince scientific evidence overwhelmingly supports the theory of creation, it should at least be mentioned.  But science in public schools should focus on the facts.  Verifiable facts, that is.  Today it blurs the line and causes debates just like this one."	Society & Culture

William Regal? Oluciano, Goldberg man handled the biggest wrestlers the WCW and WWE had to offer ok? .  . I'll give him his due. To hold a guy that size up in the jackhammer is damn impressive. But as the most dominant I personally have ever seen? I don't think he really was as impressive as a lot of other guys when they were in their prime. Everyone knows about Andre's feats of strength (the guy used to pick up his friend's cars and turn them around the other way while they were in bars), and what's even scarier is he never showed people his full strength in the ring because he was afraid he'd hurt someone. Bruiser Brody's a guy who did whatever he wanted to whomever he wanted all across the world and is arguably the greatest brawler of all-time. He influenced the modern hardcore style, changed the finishes of matches in the ring and despite his opponents best efforts, they couldn't do a damn thing about it in the ring. Brody's partner in Japan, Stan Hansen, was another guy who some say was even meaner than Brody and was even more sucessful, holding the AWA world championship and the All-Japan Triple Crown 4 times; no other Westerner has held it more than 2 times. And when you're talking about dominance and intensity, you simply can't forget the Road Warriors, the single greatest tag team of all-time and the only duo to hold the AWA, NWA and WWF tag team titles in their career.\n\nAnd by the way, it was the February 9, 1998 episode of Monday Nitro where Goldberg got manhandled by William Regal.

In your first example, you could write:\n\n0 = x^2 + 4x + 3\n\nwhich is equivalent to:\n\n0 = (x+1)(x+3)  <----  This is factoring the quadratic\n\nOnce you have it factored, you can solve the problem by setting either factor equal to 0, such as:\n\n0 = (x+1) which solves as x=(-1)\n0 = (x+3) which solves as x=(-3)\n\nIf you plus -1 or -3 back into the original equation for X you'll see that they are indeed correct solutions.

"How can you contribute to the economic recovery and stability of your country? . There is a global poverty which causes so many problems and it is due the declining economic stability so strategies or suggestions that will lead to economic recovery is the answers that I am looking through this question.  Sharing experience and expertise leading to economic stability is highly appreciated. . You have to start at the very beginning: Private Property.\n\nThe more property in private hands, the more stability. People take their property and exchange with one another; forming a marketplace. \n\nThis exchange creates Prices.\n\nPrices give us the VERY valuable indicators of Profits & Losses.\n\nProfits and Losses tell us WHERE our Earth's scarce resources should be applied.\n\nFor example, high profits tell property owners ""Invest your resources here...this is where the demand is.""\n\nAt the same time, losses tell property owners ""Remove your scarce resources from this area and apply them where they are in higher demand.""\n\nA smooth, efficient marketplace, creates stability. There is no reason to fight or go to war...instead we trade. \n\nIt all begins with private property.\n\nOn the other side of the coin, you have Socialism, where the government owns all of the property. In other words, there is only one property owner.\n\nUnder such a system, you do not have trade (since one property owner cannot trade with itself).\n\nWithout trade, you do not have prices.\n\nWithout prices, you do not have profits or losses.\n\nUnder such circumstances, there is no rational way to know where our Earth's scarce resources should be applied. It's all done by political whim.\n\nThus, you have corruption, instability, and a huge tendency to go to war.\n\nIt all starts with Private Property."	Business & Finance

Why does Superman wear his underwear on top of his clothes? . Most Imaginary Answer wins. No sexual contents please.. . They are actually Jor-El's underwear, which Superman wears to honor his late father & the entire Kryptonian race.  However, since no one wants to wear the same underwear that covered the junk that helped to conceive him, & have it pressed against his own junk, especially since his father's junk also touched his mother's junk, Superman decided to wear these outside his tights.  That way, he could honor his father, but not feel all dirty about it.\nIn an ironic twist of fate, Superman saved a young girl during the 70s.  She, too, wondered about the underwear outside the clothes.  She also thought that was a very bold & inspiring fashion statement.  Therefore, she also decided when she got older, she would occasionally wear her underwear on the outside of her clothes to honor the Man of Steel who saved her life, on those rare occasions when she would wear any underwear.  Today, we know this woman as Madonna.	Entertainment & Music

Ive watched this area 51 ordeal since I was fresh out of high school and have had my doubts but I DO know that the government originally denied Lazar ever worked at area 51 only to find out later when the ""Right to Know"" act was passed that documents proving Lazar worked at area 51 did come up. Simply put the government was lying. I also know that ununpentium or element 115 has been created but its shelf life is too short to make it practical. Scientists are still working on finding the plateau where it becomes stable. Why is 115 even shown in the periodic table as a possible element in the first place if there isnt some truth here? More documents have recently been released proving that a military general was involved in creating the reverse engineering of the so called flying saucer at area 51. The general is now retired and has since written a book on the subject and clearly states that the area 51 flying saucer was real. He also states that the aliens arent really aliens but humans from the future! Plot thickens! I would also like to ad from my own observations, why did our military all of a sudden release the stealth aircraft to the public and have sold some of the planes to other countries? We learned once not to let our pants down and have since become one of the sneakiest and ruthless countries in the world when it comes to warfare.

"where can i find free contracts/agreements? . i'm talking about business/loan contracts where if someone borrows (i loan them) money, they agree that they have to pay me back by a certain time period, and also pay me a certain amount of interest?\n\nthe interest thing isn't very important. i'm just looking to guarantee that (at least) 100% of the money i loaned to them is returned to me, and in a fairly timely manner.\n\nit is critically important that these contracts are legally-binding, since i would like to have the option of taking legal action in the unlikely even that the person does not pay me back. \n\nthey don't have to necessarily be free, but at least extremely low cost. . Pre-made contracts/agreements are very complicated documents. If you don't know EXACTLY what that document says, you can still get shafted like you didn't have a contract in the first place. \n\nYou should do two things: 1) type a common sense letter that details how much was borrowed, the date the loan must be repaid, etc. and have the borrower sign and date it.  You keep the original. A copy can be given to the other guy.\n\nThen 2) DO NOT make the loan in cash. It should be a check. You should indicate that it's a loan on the memo line (something like ""Loan to Jack to be pd 8/1/06""), and you need to keep the cancelled check in a safe place.\n\nSince it sounds like you want the option of taking legal action, find out what the maximum amount is for small-claims court in the city/county where you live and where the other guy lives.  If small-claims court will only accept cases for $5,000 and under -- don't lend more than that.\n\nThat way if you have to go to court, you can do it on your own in small claims court instead of hiring a lawyer.\n\nAnd I think it goes without saying... but don't accept cash or personal checks as payment.

"Creationists:  What mechanism limits evolution? . We all agree that the following three statements are true:\n\n1:  Mutations occur in living organisms;\n2:  Of these, some are inherited;\n3:  Of these, some affect reproductive success.\n\nIf there is no limit to this process, then there is no limit to the change that evolution can achieve - By the incremental accumulation of millions of completely random insertions, alterations and deletions in the genetic code, each one tested against its environment by natural selection, a single-celled organism can evolve into a blue whale.  All that is required is resources - i.e. 4.5 billion years or so, and an entire planet to work with.\n\nIf creationists wish to dispute that evolution can do this, then they need to identify a mechanism which can limit evolution - Something which allows a certain number or type of genetic mutations, but no more.  It needs to be a mechanism which allows the sort of evolution which even creationists do not deny, such as the evolution of new strains of influenza virus, but which stops the accumulation of changes beyond a certain point (and each creationist has their own idea of where that point is, e.g. at the species level, or genus, or whatever).\n\nSo, this is the challenge to the evolution deniers:  Identify and describe the mechanism which limits evolution, showing how it controls mutations in the genetic code to prevent indefinite change.\n\nIf you can't do that then you have no business denying the evolutionary origins of living organisms. . Transmutation is a little used English word and biological term.  In plain English, it means to change the nature of something.  In biology, it means to change one species into another species; ""speciation"" is more commonly used.  Transmutation is commonly used in nuclear physics where it refers to changing one element into another by changing the element's nucleus.\n\nIn the book, ""Macroevolution"" Steven Stanley lists a half dozen confirmed speciation events which occurred in modern times.\n\nOne classic example of beneficial mutations is the peppered moth.  In its original form, about half of individuals were light and half dark.  When pollution darkened tree trunks, the light peppered moths stood out and were preferentially eaten.  The composition of the population shifted to mostly dark colored moths with only a few percent light colored ones.\n\nAdditions to the genetic code of a species occur when an error during reproduction results in (1) part of the species' DNA is copied twice and (2) DNA from another species is incorporated.\n\nIcarus62's three statements do deal with mIcroevolution.  What you don't understand, is that mIcroevolution is simply mAcroevolution observed over a short time.  Read his question!!  Basically, he was saying, ""We all agree that mIcroevolution occurs.  Given this, what is to stop mAcroevolution from occuring?""  \n\nTo be taken seriously, creationists will have to do something other than nitpick at evolutionary theory.  They must develop theories of their own.  Creationists are a laughingstock because they make no attempt at generating testable scientific theories, and then testing them.\n\nIcarus62, good job!"

It is more advanced than AC-2 and provides six channels of audio in less space than two-channel stereo CD. AC-3 and ""Dolby Digital"" are synonymous.

"what is a virgin? .  . In its most general sense, virginity is characterized by a state of unimpacted purity, usually stemming from a lack of experience (for example, newcomers to game Bingo could be referred to as virgins). Traditionally, virgin is used to describe a person who has not engaged in sexual intercourse. This use is traditionally restricted to a person who has not yet engaged in vaginal intercourse, but it is sometimes used to describe someone who has not engaged in sexual activities in general. Also, someone can be referred to as an ""anal virgin,"" being a virgin to anal sex (specifically receiving anal sex). The status of ""virginity"" is sometimes respected and valued in certain societies, especially in relation to views of many religions on sexual conduct before marriage. The term maiden is also sometimes used to mean a virgin, although that can also refer to an unmarried or merely young woman.\n\nBtw, some cultures and religions have slightly different meaning."

"why beverage such as coke make a fiz when you open the container? .  . Sodas are carbonated, meaning that they have Carbon Dioxide gas dissolved in the liquid.  When a soda goes ""flat"", almost all the Carbon Dioxide has escaped.\n\nCarbon Dioxide is a gass at any normal pressure/temperature we would deal with soda at (refrigerator, store shelf, ...), and being a gas, its solubility in water depends greatly on two things, the temperature of the solution and the pressure above the solution.\nA lower temperature or higher pressure makes CO2 gas more soluble in water, thus it is always best to keep your botttles closes and in the refrigerator in order to keep the soda from going flat.\n\nThe carbon Dioxide gass dissolved in the water reaches an equilibrium with CO2 that has gotten out of solution and has become trapped inside the bottle above the liquid, when this happens, the amount of CO2 in solution is constant.  When you open the bottle and relieve the pressure above the liquid, the equilibrium is disturned and the gas dissolved in the liquid comes out of solution to try to re-establish the equilibrium.  That is why you see a bunch of bubbles when you open a soda bottle/can, it is the CO2 gas coming out of solution due to the decrease in pressure."	Science & Mathematics

I am having some problems with computer configuration after installing a wireless mouse and keyboard set!? . It works fine after i install it but when i have to re-start the computer for any reason i am taken to a prompt screen telling me that my computer configuration has been changed and it gives me several options. one is to go into Windows in safe mode but lose my previous configuration, or it tells me to try to resart Windows normally or to try to go to the last correct configuration If i go to safe mode i lose my configuration and if i try to restart Windows or find the last correct configuration i am taken back to the prompt window that i started off with.\nI followed the instructions on the book and on the driver correctly and it keeps doing this. At every re-start i have to put the original keyboard and mouse back on and re-install the driver and the wireless units and then remove the old units and then wireless works fine until the next start-up. Can anyone help me? . G'day,\n\nA few things come in minds.\n1. Try to download the latest driver/software for your wireless set from the manufacturer's website.  Make sure you uninstall the old driver/software before installing the new one.\nIf the previous suggestion does not work there are 2 possibilities as follows:\n2a. You may have a corrupted Operating System (I assume you are using Windows XP).  You may need to reformat your HDD and reinstall your operating system from scratch.  Please refer to some answers in Yahoo Answers about reformatting HDD and make sure you back up your data files before doing so.  This is gonna be a major work if you want to take this way\n2b. Pls dun get offended, but you might buy a cheap brand wireless set. I helped a few of my clients installing cheap/unknown wireless set that they bought themselves and it gives me alot of problems.  Once I suggest them to exchange with well-known brands wireless set (eg. Microsoft or Logitech), the hardware works perfectly without any problems.  So you may want to try this option first before reformatting HDD.\n\nHope this helps.  Good Luck :)	Computers & Internet

What prevents thermal cameras from detecting temperatures under -10C? . Is it related to the band-gap of the photo-detectors? . Thermal cameras work in the infrared not in UV.  There are cameras that can sense temperatures below -10 C.  \n\nHowever, these are expensive and require special lens material.  At such long wavelengths glass is no longer transparent.  Materials like germanium (an opaque metal in visible light but transparent in far infrared) are used to make lenses.  \n\nThe cameras also require cooling.  You can imagine that a warm camera trying to see -10C would just see itself.  The lens and the CCD array will glow and wipe out the image unless they are cooled to well below -10C.\n\nThe signal from the cold object is also very weak so the cameras electrical noise becomes a big issue requiring more sophisticated electronics.\n\nThese concerns make such cameras very expensive.

"a question about islam, What is the different btwen sunny nd shiya? .  . Sunni Muslims are the largest denomination of Islam. They are referred to as Ahl ul-Sunna (Arabic: أهل السنة), the folks of the tradition. The word Sunni comes from the word sunna (Arabic : سنة ) which means the tradition of the prophet of Islam Muhammad.\n\nShi'a Islam or Shi`ism (from the Arabic word شيعة, Persian: شیعه) is the second largest denomination of the religion of Islam. Shi'a Muslims adhere to the teachings of the Islamic prophet Muhammad and his Ahlul Bayt (family). Thus, Shi'as reject the rule of the initial three Sunni Caliphs as Sunnis reject the Imamate of the Shi'a Imams. The singular/adjective form is shi`i (Arabic: شيعي.) and refers to a supporter of the Ahlul Bayt and of Ali ibn Abi Talib (Imam Ali) in particular.\n\nSome thirty years after Muhammad's death, the Islamic community plunged into the First Islamic civil war. This civil war led to the emergence of three distinct Islamic groups:\n\nSunnis - Sunnis regard the first four caliphs (Abu Bakr, Umar ibn al-Khattab, Uthman, and Ali) as Rightly Guided Caliphs, that is, caliphs who ruled in accordance with the Qur'an and the sunnah, or way of Muhammad and Sunni reject the Shia Imams. Sunnis believe that most of the succeeding caliphs failed to live up to these standards. In spite of these failures on the part of the secular leadership, the Sunni clergy (the ulema) counseled believers to submit to the authorities; this was better than constant community strife. The full name of the Sunni branch is Ahl al-Sunna wa al-Jama'ah. \nShi'a - Shi'a regard Imam Ali as the first Imam and generally reject the first three sunni's caliphates, believing that his was the only ""Rightly Guided"" caliphate, and that only the Imams of the household and descendants of Muhammad have the right to rule. Shi'as and a handful of Sunni scholars accepted Hasan ibn Ali's claim as caliph, though historical consensus states that Hasan Have ruled for six months.The Salafis (or the Early Muslims), do not accept the Shi'a as Muslims. \n\nThis was the third group:\n\nKhwarij, or Kharijites - The Khwarij were initially loyal to Ali ibn Abi Talib, the fourth caliph, but turned against him after he accepted arbitration during the First Islamic civil war. Because the Khwarij had a very narrow view of what constitutes kufr (acts that invalidate one's Islam), they quickly split up into sects within themselves, each accusing one another of having fallen into disbelief. Though one branch of the Khwarij survives in Yemen and Oman as the Ibadi denomination of Islam, Khwarij doctrine has been largely rejected and relegated to the history books. \nOther divisions have arisen since the civil war of the 7th century CE. Some groups are now extinct. Of the existing groups, Sunni Muslims do not accept members of the Nation of Islam, Ahmadiyya, and Zikri as fellow Muslims."	Business & Finance

"Is it common for  an individual to buy your mortgage, and is it strange that the same person buys your 2nd? . These loans were meant to be short-term, high interest only payments, hardmoney, with a balloon payment at 5 years with ridged terms secured  by our attorney to ""get us through the selling of our property"", but actually and exclusively controlled by him to pay himself his exhorbanent leagal fee's without our understanding while appointing himself sucsessor trustee in the living trust and will without prior discussion. . You're running into a ton of issues here...\n\nFirst of all, the attorney is going to have to be able to docuement ALL of the fees incured for providing you services. He is in no way obliged to any fees for providing the ""loan"" for you unless he is also a licensed loan broker. The fees for securing the loan are not to exceed 5.99% of the total loan amount. These fees are stated as Non-recurring closing costs and are all the fees listed on the HUD-1 closing statement minus the title insurance fee and any state incurred fees. Basically the top 8 lines on the HUD-1 plus the escrow fee.\n\nIt is VERY common for loans to be sold. In this case the attorney realizes he is not a lending institution and with good intelligence has reverted the loan (Probobly sold it at a premium, illegally since he's probobly not a licensed mortgage broker) and made yet another profit.\n\nThere is also an issue in him appointing himself as the trustee to the note. As stated in RESPA a trustee to a secured note is to be a ""Mutual third party with no interest in the loan transaction"". \n\nI imagine the entity that bought the loans is a ""loan to own"" type entity and hoping that you will defualt on your mortgage. So, if I was you I would be very wary of missing any payements whatsoever to your mortgage. If you have to make a choice between paying your mortgage or car notes, pay the mortgage.\n\nA real-estate attorney will gladly look over the transaction and ensure that everything was done not only legally but ethically as well without charging you an upfront fee. If he finds there is misconduct, he will take on the case without any upfront fees if he is worth his weight.\n\nGood luck, and next time you need some cash shoot me an Email.

Why do you have to pay for unemployment on your taxes? . people tend to think its your tax dollars that pays for unemployment. Its not. Businesses pay for insurance that covers unemployment and causes their premiums to raise if claims are filed for them. So why does uncle sam get to charge u out the \na$ $ on taxes for something they never paid for? . Employers cover only a portion of unemployment.  The remainder is covered by the Federal government and the state.  This safety net helps hundreds of thousands of workers each year who are laid off with no prospect of a new job.  One of them was my father in the year 1972.  Another was me in the 80's.  Another was my sister's husband in the 90's.\n\nSometimes, we pay for things that we never personally use.  That doesn't mean that the thing isn't useful or wise to have paid.  I am happy to pay for house insurance; although I hope and pray that I may never need to cash in on the policy.  Likewise, I'm happy to pay the unemployment tax, though I hope and pray I never again need to make a claim.	Business & Finance

They are concerned about the little things that contribute to the poluting of the environment, but are not really looking at what needs to be done to the major companies that add dangerous and toxic gas emmissions to the environment every day. Why are they always targeting the little people and over looking the big people, they already take enough money from us in other ways; this is simply another way to make revenue and at the same time make the hole they have already put in our pockets bigger. If they are gonna target us, then be fair howard and carpenter start with the bigger issues; or are you afraid the big companies have too much money and will win in court, or is it that you are just simply not interested in them or the environment .

i am not a girl but had sex with a 16 year old,i am 16,its not wrong is it? .  . You didn't give enough information.\n\nDid you have sex with a 16 year old boy? Girl? what country? what state?  Different states have different laws on age of consent. In some places, it's as young as 14.  In some, it's as high as 18.  Here in Texas, it's 17, but two people within three years apart can have sex (meaning 16 and 16 is ok legally).\n\nYou didn't say if your question was a legal one or a moral one.  I'm inclined to believe it's OK morally,and likely to be OK legally, but again, depends on where you live.	Family & Relationships
"is it a sin that Yahoo!Answers suspended ""krajlicatabiaa"" from this site? . krajlicatabiaa is/was one of my favorite regular anwerers on here. she always showed respect for everybody and showed a bright, funny and smart personality.\n\nshe got suspended from this site for asking a question in a foreign language.\n\n66% of her answers were chosen as best answers! I think she's a loss to the Yahoo!Answer community.\ni don't know her, but i always enjoyed her questions.\n\none of her questions, just as an example:\n\nhttp://uk.answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AslQDp1fy3jDur4Jto2U2PcgBgx.?qid=20060620211327AAzkzK9\n\ncould we all pray (or whatever) that God (or whoever) will make Yahoo! correct this obvious error?? . The Yahoo! Gods have answered our prayers and seen fit to restore her...\n\nPractically speaking, I've often suspected that a lot of Yahoo!'s suspensions are automated. Probably whenever somebody reports abuse, it's added to a database, and after someone gets a certain number of reports, the computer automatically shuts down the account. This, of course, tilts the scales against long-term and well-known users, because sooner or later someone will report you. I think the system really prefers semi-anonymous figures who ask fact-based questions that don't require thought and give fact-based answers that don't show thought. Mediocrity wins out in the end.\n\nTwo suggestions I could make to Yahoo! would be to counterweigh abuse reports with the time someone's been on the site - someone who's amassed 20 abuse reports in 12 hours is clearly more of a threat than someone who's amassed 20 abuse reports over several months - and to offer some kind of counterbalance to abuse reports - something to accentuate the positive and not just the negative, like on eBay where feedback on a user can be positive or negative.\n\nBut Yahoo! is a private company and has the right to behave however they want... Our two choices are to accept it or walk away...\n\n----------\n\n(edit: A better question is why they haven't suspended someone like Sara F, who gives answers as ignorant as the one above...)"

"Would you have been offended? . Would you have been offended?\nWhen my partner (my girlfriend) and I started dating I weighed 134lbs. and was going to the gym regularly. During the first part of our relationship I lost ten more lbs. but she complained I looked too thin. I had minor surgery this summer and she has moved in therefore my gym time and my eating habits have sliped and I've put weight back on. I got up to 137 but now fluctunat between 134 and 136. I know even though I'm about the same weight when we met I don't look as good because I'm not as toned. Anyway I bought a sexy outfit last year for chirstmas and she has been asking me to try it on for her agian this year. I told her I was afraid it wouldn't fit but after lots of her asking i tried it on and it still fits. She is constantly telling me that I'm not fat but has agreed that I've slacked a bit and my stomach isn't as nice (which is fine it's honest and it helps encourgae me to get back in shape).Here's my complaint; when I put on the outfit and I was putting on the music she said \n\nAdditional Details\n\n7 hours ago\n""why is it when people get into realtionships they get comfortable and put on weight?"".

how to calculate all specifications for new hydraulic power pack.? . i am working has fresh engineer i want to purchase new hydraulic power pack how  i can select it . Your basic selection criteria start with flow rate @ pressure. This is going to depend on what you are trying to do, but you will find a direct correlation between the horsepower input of the pump motor and the combination of flow at pressure. Note that it is possible to make low flow at high pressure, or low pressure at high flow, but it takes a lot of power to both.\n\nA suggestion is to calculate the amount of power your require (force X distance / unit of time) and convert that to horsepower, then look for an HPU at www.Grainger.com that is about 2X that horsepower.

"Show me the economic history of Nicaragua? .  . Economic history of Nicaragua \n\nPre-Columbian and Colonial Era\nThe first Spanish explorers of Nicaragua found a welldeveloped agrarian society in the central highlands and Pacific lowlands. The rich volcanic soils produced a wide array of products, including beans, peppers, corn, cocoa, and cassava (manioc). Agricultural land was held communally, and each community had a central marketplace for trading and distributing food.\n\nThe arrival of the Spanish in the early 1500s destroyed, for all intents and purposes, the indigenous agricultural system. The early conquistadors were interested primarily in gold; European diseases and forced work in the gold mines decimated the native population. Some small areas continued to be cultivated at the end of the 1500s, but most previously tilled land reverted to jungle. By the early 1600s, cattle raising, along with small areas of corn and cocoa cultivation and forestry, had become the primary function of Nicaragua's land. Beef, hides, and tallow were the colony's principal exports for the next two and a half centuries.\n\n\nThe Coffee Boom, 1840s-1940s\nCoffee was the product that would change Nicaragua's economy. Coffee was first grown domestically as a curiosity in the early 1800s. In the late 1840s, however, as coffee's popularity grew in North America and Europe, commercial coffee growing began in the area around Managua. By the early 1850s, passengers crossing Nicaragua en route to California were served large quantities of Nicaraguan coffee. The Central American coffee boom was in full swing in Nicaragua by the 1870s, and large areas in western Nicaragua were cleared and planted with coffee trees.\n\nUnlike traditional cattle raising or subsistence farming, coffee production required significant capital and large pools of labor. Laws were therefore passed to encourage foreign investment and allow easy acquisition of land. The Subsidy Laws of 1879 and 1889 gave planters with large holdings a subsidy of US$0.05 per tree.\n\nBy the end of the nineteenth century, the entire economy came to resemble what is often referred to as a ""banana republic"" economy--one controlled by foreign interests and a small domestic elite oriented toward the production of a single agriculture export. Profits from coffee production flowed abroad or to the small number of landowners. Taxes on coffee were virtually nonexistent. The economy was also hostage to fluctuations in the price of coffee on the world markets--wide swings in coffee prices meant boom or bust years in Nicaragua.\n\n\nDiversification and Growth, 1945-77\nThe period after World War II was a time of economic diversification. The government brought in foreign technocrats to give advice on increasing production of new crops; hectarage in bananas and sugarcane increased, livestock herds grew, and cotton became a new export crop. The demand for cotton during the Korean War (1950-53) caused a rapid increase in cotton production, and by the mid-1950s, cotton was the nation's second largest export earner, after coffee.\n\nEconomic growth continued in the 1960s, largely as a result of industrialization. Under the stimulus of the newly formed Central American Common Market, Nicaragua achieved a certain degree of specialization in processed foods, chemicals, and metal manufacturing. By the end of the 1960s, however, import-substitution industrialization as a stimulus for economic growth had been exhausted. The 1969 Soccer War between Honduras and El Salvador, two members of the CACM, effectively suspended attempts at regional integration until 1987, when the Esquipulas II agreement was signed. By 1970 the industrial sector was undergoing little additional import substitution, and the collapse of the CACM meant that Nicaragua's economic growth, which had come from the expanding manufacturing sector, halted. Furthermore, the manufacturing firms that had developed under the tariff protection of the CACM were generally "	Politics & Government

If that is amounting to 10000 a time, then yes - you have to pay capital gains on that.  \n\nhow do you reduce?  well, if you have other investments that are not doing so well, and you think they wont ever do well, sell them at a loss.  this will reduce your capital gains.  this includes any capital assets you have - real estate, investments, etc, etc.  other than that, there really is no way you can avoid taxes because you already sold them for a gain.  in the future, what i would recommend is at least holding the investments for over a year to ensure long term capital gains rates.

YES.\n\nThough it depends on what you mean by ""moving""\n\nIf you mean getting from one place to another as fast or faster than light, it is possible though not currently provable.\n\nThere are a few ""workarounds"" for the light speed barrier.  My personal favorite was cooked up by Miguel Alcubierre in 1994.  It is called the Alcubierre Metric, or sometimes the Alcubierre Drive.\n\nIt relies on stretching space time in a wave that would carry a potential vessel faster than light, relative to an outside observer.  It works because relative to the space within the wave, the vessel isn't moving at all.  It also avoids the other problems with light speed travel, time dilation and such.\n\nThe problem is no one knows how to build one, but mankind has overcome every obstacle in its way thus far, I think the light speed barrier will be the same.\n\nThose saying something is impossible are usually interrupted by other people doing it.\n\nMore on the Alcubierre Metric here:\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcubierre_drive\n\n- Cai"	Science & Mathematics
Who REALLY has the stronger sex drive?  Men, or women? . It seems to me that women go out of their way to flaunt their sexuality and then claim that it is men who are the instigators.  \n\nIsn't it true that women have created a false sense of scarcity in order to use their vagina as a tool to get what they want?

It is one of our most primordial instincts.  Women have many more negative consequences to their sexuality than men do, and they react to this by limiting their sexual contacts more than men.  \n\nYou are not entitled to have sex with any woman you desire.  It's not artificial scarcity... it's that you personally are unappealing.  Sorry:(	Health

why did the us go to war during world war one..? .  . Entry of the United States\n \nPresident Wilson before Congress, announcing the break in official relations with Germany on February 3, 1917.America's policy of insisting on neutral rights while also trying to broker a peace resulted in tensions with both Berlin and London. U.S. President Woodrow Wilson repeatedly warned that he would not tolerate unrestricted submarine warfare, and the Germans repeatedly promised to stop. A proposal to Mexico to join the war against the Allies was exposed in February, bringing war closer. (See Zimmermann telegram). After further U-boat (German submarines) attacks on American merchant ships, Wilson requested that Congress declare war on Germany, which it did on April 6, 1917 (see: Woodrow Wilson declares war on Germany on Wikisource). The U.S. House of Representatives approved the war resolution 373-50, the U.S. Senate 82-6, with opposition coming mostly from German American districts.

C'est un jeune joueur qui a beaucoup de qualités, mais qui a aussi encore beaucoup de progrès à faire tant dans sa gestion de son effort que dans sa gestion du jeu. Ce que l'on dit de lui est un peu surfait. Il a fait le jeu à Marseille est on en fait le futur Zidane. En remettant les choses dans leurs contexte, on remarque que Marseille n'avait pas grand choses à proposer et donc il était plus facile pour lui de se mettre en valeur. Ensuite, il ne sera jamais je pense le leader de l'équipe de France qu'on attends simplement parce qu'il n'en a ni les épaules ni la mentalité. Il reste malgré tout un joueur de talent qui si il continue à progresser deviendra un des meilleurs joueur français de sa génération.	Sports

"can someone please tell me were i can read fruits basket online? .  . I'll help point you in the right direction, so let's hope I do my best!\n\nFirst off, if you have a livejournal account, join the livejournal community 'Free_Manga' ( The link should be down in the sources. ).  Once that's finished, head to their profile and check out their tags page.  Let me make it clear that you will not be able to check out their tags page, where they house all their anime links and such, without being a member of the community.\n\nIf you don't like, I'd go to gotlurk.net.  I'm serious, people think IRC is so hard to understand, and I myself was IRC stupid until I found this site.  Their site has recent manga, and it's not hard to learn how to use IRC if you go to their forums.  Once in their forums, head to their support page, and it'll teach you all you have to do.  After you get yourself prepared, you'll easily be able to copy and paste the code for the manga into the IRC chat, and you'll be able to download it to your own computer.  I'm POSITIVE that Gotlurk.net/#lurk has Fruits Basket.  If you wish to choose this direction, you'll need the IRC client, MIRC.  You can find it at MIRC.com.  Believe me, it may sound complicated, but I now have all 42 volumes of DBZ, and it took me an hour to download 'em.\n\nI know it used to be available on directmanga.net, but I'm not sure if it even exists anymore.  If you don't like any of the ideas I've given you, you should try to search for, ""Fruits Basket Manga Scanlations"" on yahoo or google.\n\nI'm sorry if this is too confusing.  I'm gonna go searching for some Fruits Basket manga for you, too.  Good luck!"	Entertainment & Music

"how do i finish my bmx? . ive built a bmx and finished it all, but then my chain kept falling off ,so a freind told me i need to replace the axle because the rear wheel wobled,  so i took the axle out.\nwould a mountain bike axle fit on to my bmx its a 20"" frame?\nand what would you sudgest i do? cheers pete . Pete,\n\nFirst, you need to make sure the chain tension is appropriate. you should be able to move the chain a half an inch up or down. \nIf there's too much slack, the chain will of course fall off if you hit any bumps. Try loosening up your rear wheel axle nuts and pulling back on the wheel. Don't forget to make sure the wheel is straight in the dropouts before you tighten the nuts again. Also, check to make sure the wheel has equal spacing up at the joints of the chain and seat stays. \n\nThis is the other issue. If your wheel is crooked, that means your cassette is crooked too, which would create sort of a twisting effect, causing the chain to pop off. Just make sure your wheel is as straight has possible, and the chain is relatively tight (half an inch of slack maximum), and you should be good. \n\nI wouldn't suggest putting a mountain bike axle in your hub. It's not going to be very cost-effective, and if your BMX bike is high-quality brand (not Next, Huffy, Magna, Vertical, etc...), chances are it has a 14 mm axle. The mountain bike axle won't fit in your dropouts correctly, which is a safety hazard, plus you could potentially damage your bike.\n\nIf none of this works, take a look at the teeth on both your rear cassette and your front chainring; if even one tooth is bent, that could cause your chain to fall off. Sometimes you can get lucky and bend the teeth back with a small pipe wrench, but in many cases the parts will need to be replaced.\n\nHope that helps some, Pete!"	Sports

"I am confused and drunk right now. Should I retire? . I am a liberal Democrat from the great state of Massachusetts. I have a small drinking problem and my hobbies do include drinking and walking around my backyard in my underwear watching my nephews bring over girls to rape. My brothers killed Marilyn Monroe and the whole family has BIG issues with our teeth, flying in airplanes and guns. I enjoy midnight rides after drinking a fifth of bourbon with a beautiful lady at my side as I drive over rivers using bridges. I am so drunk right now and confused. Do you think I should retire from public office? Help me please. And I do think Hillary is HOT. . Hell, that's nothing! I'm a conservative Repubican from the great state of Texas. I used to get really drunk while I was in college, but my Dad always managed to ""take care of it"". Even when I was into drugs, he kept it all covered up so that I could continue my path toward public service. Then I joined the Reserves, but only because I thought it would be cool to fly a jet plane. So my Dad arranged that, and then saw to it that I could get out of any real 'military service' since I was too busy bilking investors out of millions of dollars. My brothers might not have killed a movie star, but one of them caused the infamous Silverado Savings & Loan scandal; my other brother helped me steal an election (or two) with fraudulent voting 'chads' and irregularities in how those votes were tabulated. Then my Dad's influence with Supreme Court justices helped me go on to become the best damn president this country ever's seen! I enjoy hanging out with my capitalist buddies and planning how to illegally invade sovereign nations just so we can grab all the oil underneath their sands and make me, my buddy Big Dick, and all our cowboy friends richer and richer and richer.\nWhat the heck, we've killed tens of thousands of Iraqi women and children, and more than 2,500 American soldiers, but like my buddy Donnie Rumsfeld once said at a news conference, ""Stuff Happens."" \nI've single-handedly put this country trillions of dollars in debt, while playing ""Robin Hood in Reverse"" (that's where we take from the poor and give it all to the rich). \nWith the help of a pliable, cowardly, corrupt U.S. Congress, I've dismantled the U.S. Constitution, destroyed all environmental-impact laws and regulations that were designed to keep our fragile ecology in place, and turned this country into a police state where citizens are considered guilty until proven innocent in a rigged court of law.\nSmall countries all over the Earth are now terrified of the U.S., and are considering their own nuclear weapons programs just to defend themselves against the globe's newest ""evil empire' - the United States of America!\nI condonded all of my friend Donnie Rumsfeld's unspeakable terror, torture tactics, abuse and murder until the damn press got wind of it all. Then I put on my best actors' face and told gullible Americans that I think it was unconscionable. Ya' gotta love Ronald Reagan for writin' the Republican manual on great acting!\nI watch out for my wealthy elitist friends, lobbyists, special interest groups and huge corporations that can all make generous (if not illegal) contributions to help keep the GOP in power. Meanwhile, we like to neglect the needs of the poor, the aged, the homeless, the disabled, the underprivileged, and the unemmployed. Why should those scumbags think they have a right to live in America anyway?\nI've pretty much accomplished everything my Dad and Big Dick told me to do, all without much accountability or remorse. But, then I've lived the life of a spoiled rich kid who never had to take any responsibility for his actions. I just wish I could find an intern in the White House with whom I could have oral sex (of course, she'd have to proclaim to be a born-again Christian).\nI'm not sure whether I should retire from public office of wait until I'm impeached or tried for high treason and crimes against humanity. \nBig Dick and Donnie say there's a special oil-soaked corner of Hell that Satan's reserved just for us where we can spend our eternal damnation blaming each other for what a mess we made of the world. \nAnd, maybe, if you're as confused and drunk as you are right now, we can have a drink and talk about our differences. Just make sure I'm within earshot of Big Dick so he can tell me exactly what to say. Ain't politics great? It don't matter whether you're a Republican or a Democra"	Politics & Government

"Why are people so upset about the government being able to tap phone lines and access phone records? . If you've got nothing to hide you shouldn't care, right? . It is very commendable that you have nothing to hide. But that is not even close to being the point.\n\nFor centuries we have been protected by the Constitution against ""illegal search and seizure"". It is one of the most sacred rights that Americans have been able to enjoy since our Independence. Law enforcement or Government agencies are only allowed such measures if probable cause can be shown and a judge allows them.\n\nBut now the Government has began collecting information, tapping phone lines and using other investigative methods WITHOUT a court order. This is the worst kind of invasion of privacy and a 100% violation of our constitutional rights. \n\nWhat I also find nearly as disturbing is the fact they the terrorists are getting EXACTLY want they wanted. Whether it be illegal detention and torture of SUSPECTED terrorists or tapping and spying on US citizens without due cause, the US Government is becoming just like the regimes it is trying to change. \n\nHow are we to convince foreign governments to adopt our system of government when our own officials disregard our Constitution?"

I need to retrieve the files from my old computer, but the computer will not even turn on? . It just beeps at me and some of the indicator lights flash. Any idea on how to override this so I can turn it on and get my files off of it? I've tried turning it on without the battery in, and just running it on the AC power. I've tried with just the battery and with both the AC and battery. The computer is an IMB ThinkPad T22 and is running with Windows 2000 (I think) . If you have another working computer, you could take the hard drive out of that machine and put it in your other computer as a slave drive.  That way you can boot the working computer, and the transplanted hard drive will show up as the E:/ drive (or other letter, depending on what all is in your system) and you can copy all the files over.\n\nYou may need a special adapter to plug a notebook hard drive into a desktop computer, but you should be able to pick one up at radio shack for pretty cheap.

Sadly, especially in my family, I find that my older Filipino family members are prejudiced against black people or other non-white or Filipino people.  I don't know the logic behind it.

"If you don't belive in god, do you go to hell? . Consider this, a man born in a village in South America is isolated from modern society for his entire life. He lives a good life and does a lot of good for the people around him, he has a family and loves them very much but his life has no religion. When he dies does god send him to hell for not believing in him? \n\nIf so how can god be considered infinitely good if he sends this man, and billions of others like him to burn in the depths of hell even when they have lived good lives. . God says that he is a merciful God. To answer your question I would say ""NO"". God knows there are people out there who haven't heard of him. God sees every human's heart and mind and knows what kind of person they are. God reserves judgment unto himself. But another question is--what is hell? The Greek word Hades referrs to a hole in the ground where all man goes when he dies. The burning hell you are referring to is the Lake of Fire where those who have received God's judgment go. All mankind have to stand before God Almighty when it's their time. God opens the book of life and the rewards He has written in there are given to the people whose names are written in His book."

Mass percent using two algebraic equations? . A sample of a mixture containing only sodium chloride and potassium chloride has a mass of 6.4100g. When this sample is dissolved in water and excess silver nitrate is added, a white precipitate (silver chloride) forms. After filtration and drying, this precipitate has the mass 12.7559g.\nWhat is the mass percentage of sodium chloride in the mixture? . Your two basic algebraic equations are:\nmoles Na + moles K = moles Cl \n(g Na+) + (g K+) + (g Cl-) = 6.4100 g\n\nThe mass of the final precipitate means that there are 7.50921 x 10-2 mol of chloride ions present in the initial mixture.\nSee:\nmol Cl = mol AgCl = g AgCl/MW AgCl = 12.7559/169.87 = 7.50921 x 10 -2 mol\n\nThe mass of the chloride component of the starting materials is then determined by:\n\ng Cl = MW Cl x mol Cl = (7.50921 x 10-2 mol) x (35.45 g/mol) = 2.662 g\n\nPlug that back into the second eqn and you get:\n\n(g Na+) + (g K+) + (2.662 g) = 6.4100 g\nor\n(g Na+) + (g K+) = 3.748 g\n\nConvert back to moles and plug that into the first equation and you get:\n\nmoles Na + moles K = 7.50921 x 10 -2 mol\nor\nmoles Na + ((g K+) / (39.1 g/mol)) = 7.50921 x 10 -2 mol\nor\n((g Na+) / (22.99 g/mol)) + ((3.748 - g Na+) / (39.1 g/mol)) = 7.50921 x 10 -2 mol\n\nAnd now solve for g Na + \n\nDivide that by 3.748 g and you're there!

Eye injury - damages from employer?? . My hubby nearly lost his eye in work due to a new piece of equipment not having any written instructions or warning on it,  the equipment did not break or malfunction, but there was nothing to indicate how to use it. When hubby asked boss what do do he was told to 'work it out for yourself - im busy'\n\nWe are making a claim for damages, as his eyesight has been permanently damaged, just wondered if there are any solicitors online who could give me an idea of what kind of damages we might get?  \n\nJust to say we arent money-grabbers, but the amount could make a difference as to wether or not we can afford to have another baby!\n\nThanks. . To succeed in a case such as this three things must be shown: There was a duty of care owed, this duty of care was breached and the damage resulted from that breach. All employers owe a duty of care to their employees, in the U.K this includes adequate training, supervision and competent colleagues. Provided he was actually an employee and not a contractor or self employed then a duty of care can be presumed and in this case the remaining two conditions will be fulfilled. \n\nI am presuming that your solicitor will be suing in Tort (negligence). I remember a few years ago, there was a book which detailed what one would receive for a certain injury, I'll see if I can dig it out to give you an idea so check back in a few days. The amount you will receive in damages depends on a number of different factors though and is subject to enhancement or reduction for several reasons, i.e the severity of the damage and the impact this will have on his daily life etc and also whether the employer manages to atribute any contributory negligence to your husband. Your husband should also receive any back pay which he may be owed as a result of missing work and any other out of pocket expenses (i.e. travel costs for hospital appointments).

I know that my credit history will not be passed from England but it I'm wondering how hard it will be for me to apply for bank accounts, credit cards etc etc. Thanks . My cousins are coming from overseas and imigrating to the U.S. So I have a general idea. It's very difficult for them right now to get credit cards due to their lack of any credit history. The only ones available are either bank cards that they open an account with, or other credit card companies that will give them a small credit line and require annual fees.\n\nTo quickly build credit, I would recommend opening a bank account of course, start paying some sort of bills (utlities) quickly to get a record of on-time payments. You will quickly establish a history and your credit situation will improve. I hope that helps!\n\nGood luck!\n\n**EDIT:\n\nI just noticed you said you were moving to the U.S. to join your husband.

The best way to set your target score (or to see how ""bad"" your scores are) is to pick a few target schools, call the admissions office, and ask what the median SAT score was. \nGenerally, 1290 is pretty low and you need to retake the test. Contrary to the first answer, there are no ""evil tricks"" on the SAT; there are, however, problems designed to differentiate between people who can make quick decisions,  pay attention to details, and stay calm under pressure, and people who cannot do those things. These are all skills you can learn, and if you do need higher scores, you need to invest some time into studying. \nWhichever book/company you chose to study with, start by taking a free practice SAT at your local Kaplan center. The test results will spell out where your weaknesses are so you can study smarter and get more points. \n\nWhile you're at it, don't forget to check out the ACT. Your schools will accept either test, and you may find the ACT a lot easier. You can take that free practice test at Kaplan, too.\n\ngood luck!"	Education & Reference

If the police arrest a mime, do they tell him he has the right to remain silent? .  . Yes, according to the Constitution of the United States of America, a suspect must be told his rights. They have the right to remain silent and they have the right to a lawyer. If they cant afford a lawyer, the state will provide them one. The mime would stay silent anyway.

"if you will sanction my loan,i will start the construction.Is this sentence grammatically correct??please help . Please some one help me out with answer to this question......... . Most often it would say something to the effect of ""If you approve my loan, I will start construction.""\n\nSo using your words, ""If you sanction my loan, I will start construction.""  'Will' is not needed in the first half and 'the' is not needed, in fact should not be there.  ""the construction"" would be the noun version, where you are more than likely saying construction as a verb...If you act, I will act.  However, if it's a cause and effect sentence, you want it like this...\n\nAfter(or When) you sanction my loan, then I will start construction."	Education & Reference

"what causes a cold sore? .  . Typically, cold sores are caused by contact with an infected source. Most commonly, cold sores near and around the mouth are caused by oral sex or oral contact with another person infected with cold sores.

how many Senators,Governors , Congressmen have children doing active duty in Iraq? . Just curious how many of these leaders who support the war effort are willing to sacrifice their children in the fight against terrorism.Has President Bush asked his daughters to support his war on terrorism in Iraq? . In the movie Fahrenheit 9/11 Michael More closed it with thie question.  He attempted to get members of Congress to send their children to serve in Iraq as a way of pointing out the class divide between the United States' leaders and the people who serve in the military. Moore did acknowledge that at the start of the war in Iraq, there appears to have been only one member of Congress with a child serving in Iraq: Sen. Tim Johnson (D-South Dakota), whose son Brooks serves in the Army.\n\nTwo more Congressmen had sons who reportedly were being sent to Iraq in late 2003 or early 2004: Representatives Joe Wilson (R-South Carolina) and Duncan Hunter (R-California).\n\nIn addition, there are some other members of Congress and the Bush administration with children or relatives serving in the military if not necessarily in Iraq. For example, Representative Mark Kennedy (R-Minnesota), who was seen in Fahrenheit 9/11, reportedly has a nephew serving in Afghanistan, and one of his four children reportedly was thinking of joining the navy. Attorney General John Ashcroft's son Andrew also reportedly has served in the Navy in the Persian Gulf.	Politics & Government

i need help w/ a physics problem.  it has to do w/ acceleration and velocity. i have the answer from the book. . Speedy Sue, driving at 30.0 m/s, enters a one-lane tunnel. She then observes a slow moving van 155m ahead traveling at 5.00 m/s. sue applies her brakes but can accelerate only at -2.00 m/s2 because the road is wet. Will there be a collision? if yes, determine how far into the tunnel and at what time the collision occurs. \nThe answer says that there will be a collision 212 m into the tunnel at 11.4 sec. . Use the formula: \n\ndistance = vt + 0.5 * at^2\n\nThe distance of the van from the entrance of the tunnel is Dv = 5t + 155.\n\nThe distance of the car from the entrance of the tunnel is Dc = 30t + 0.5 * 2(t^2).\n\nThe two collide when Dv = Dc\n\n5t + 155 = 30t - t^2\nt^2 - 25t + 155 = 0\n\nUse quadratic formula and you get \n\nt = 11.4 and 13.6\n\nThere would be therefore be a collision at 11.4 seconds.\n\nThen use same formula to work out distance\n\nDc = 30 * 11.4 - 1 * 11.4 * 11.4\nDc = 212m\n\n**Phew..

A Question for Christians....I saw an article about the actress portraying Mary in the Nativity movie..? . The article was comparing the actress to Mary. The 16-year old actress, according to the article, is expecting a baby w/ her boyfriend. The article was talking about how the actress' life is similar to Mary's- they were both pregnant out of wedlock at a young age, Joseph was a carpenter, the actress' boyfriend is a carpenter. Now, before anyone accuses me of judging, that's not what I'm doing. But, it kind of bugged me that they were doing that. It seemed to me like it was lessening the importance of Jesus' birth. You can't compare a teenager getting pregnant to the divine conception of Jesus Christ. Maybe it's just me.... I'd like other Christian's viewpoints on this. Thanks!! . i read that article only a few minutes ago and thought the exact same thing. They are comparing the two and they have nothing to do with eachother. Unlike the actress, Mary did not get pregnant because she slept with her boyfriend. I think that article will lead people astray and lead them away from the real gospel. That is what Satan wants...distortion of the truth. The movie, however, looks like a pretty good movie. When I see it though, I may be bugged the whole time thinking about that article. God bless you!\n\nP.S. I am in no way judging the actress here. I'm proud of her for choosing life for her child. I'm only commenting between the comparison between herself and mary that the media has made.	Society & Culture

"Outlook ""/c ipm.task ""? . Is there any way I can create a task with a specific name with this command ? This one only opens the outlook, but I have to manually put the title and date. \n\nMaybe there is a macro that can do it ? \n\nHere is the scenerio:\n1) An e-mail message is coming to my mailbox in Eudora\n2) The messages' title triggers the filter and the filter notifies outlook about that.\n3) Outlook creates a new task.\n\nI can have the Eudora open Outlook and open task window ( with the /c imp.task command ) but this is as far as I can go.\n\nAny ideas ? . I really can't visualize what you are trying to accomplish. Could you please give me an example or more details, and also confirm that BOTH Outlook and Entourage are in the mix here? If so, do they both have unique mailboxes or is it the same mail account, and what kind of mail server?  I'm wondering if there is not a less convoluted way to get what you want accomplished.\n--------------------\nAdding this after you added more :)\nWhat kind of mail server are you connected to? And is the mail stored in the mailbox or on a .pst file on your computer? If you have Exchange and store the mail in the mailbox, you can script it but you don't have to have your script open Outlook. I'm a little rusty on this but if it describes your setup, let me know and I'll pull the cobwebs out of my head.  You bascially want the script to initiate the MAPI call, load the ipm.note forms on the server or prepare to put data in ipm.note format, input the data and commit it to the store. The Outlook client expects certain input for ipm.note and it does not expect to find it outside of the active window.\n-------------\nAnd wherever I say ipm.note I mean ipm.task--- it'll work the same for both."

"Should a snowboard be completely flat against the ground when laid down? . I'm still a beginner and I bought my first board.  When I lay the board on flat ground it kind of bows in the middle (the toe and heel touch the ground but not the middle).  Is this okay and how will this affect my riding?

I need help with my daughters feelings.? . My daughter is 9 years old and 5 years ago she lost her grandma. Her grandma and pappy used to take her everyday and all weekend long a lot of times. When she died a part of my daughters spirit died as well. I have talked to her, I have her talking to therapist, but nothing seems to help. every other night and, her grandfather has put her through a lot since the death. Not long (meaning within a month or 2) after her grandma died, he tried on more than one occassion to commit suicide. Very tramatic for her to go through that, then he started dating a crazy woman only 2 months after she died, then that didn't work. Then he dated another woman a month after the 1st and then announced on her birthday only 9 months after her grandma died that he was going to marry this woman. This woman hates our kids, has tried to stab her grandfather, has watched her slap me, and won't allow him the time to visit. We did move away for awhile, but I think she needs him, as much as he needs her. HELP!!! . I truly believe that you must sit down with your father one-on-one and have a heart-to-heart conversation with him. To do this without making him feel defensive, I would suggest that you ask your dad to try to understand that what you need to discuss with him isn't easy for you and hope that he keeps in mind that you only want what is best for your daughter and for him as well.\n\nIf he has the love for his granddaughter that most grandparents do for their grandchildren, then you might want to focus the conversation on her and her emotional well-being. Express to him the negative and life-long challenges that result from the decisions he has made and continues to make. Perhaps it is best to address the fact that he has put aside any self respect and self worth by deciding to marry a woman that obviously has deep emotional issues that aren't healthy for him, his granddaughter, or anyone else in the family for that matter. Ask him to give these points some serious thought.\n\nThere are several books that can help your dad sort through his emotions, while also helping him to recognize the destructive path he is heading toward if he doesn't do something to take responsibility for his life and his pain.\n\nI hope this was helpful, I pray that all works out for you and your family. If things do not change or get worse... I also believe that it is crucial that you establish a very open and honest relationship with you daughter and that you use the situations that come about to help your daughter feel secure within herself and to help her understand that life isn't always easy and sometimes our lives are turned upside down for many reasons. Unconditional love from mom and dad, while guiding her through life's lessons to always take life's challenges and chose to learn from them and to help others do the same along the way would be my message to my kids.\n\nThe Four Agreements is an excellent book to help with an overall personal fulfillment/development guide. It sometimes can be repetitive and might seem strange in the beginning but it you ask that your dad and your daughter (even yourself) to make a commitment to read the entire book, I think you will all come away with a much more positive outlook on life and love.\n\nMy son would also like to suggest that you remind your daughter that her grandma is always looking down on her from heaven and will always be with her. I think that this was such a great suggestion as I remember when I lost my grandma when I was 6 years old... knowing that she was always there made me feel as though I could get through anything and I never felt alone.

teeth whitening after getting braces off.....? . I just got my braces off a couple of weeks ago, and i want to get my teeth whitened. \n1) do i need to wait a certain number of weeks before i whiten them?\n2)What is the best, cheap, but effective teeth whitening system? Crest? . I am familiar with these questions as I too have had the same 'dilemma'.  Here is what I was told by my dentist and representatives from several (I shopped around) tooth whitening companies:\n\n1) A residual glue that you cannot see nor can dentists/orthodontists remove by simple polishing of the teeth after the braces are removed can remain on the surface of the teeth for up to four weeks after the braces are removed.  If whitening is attempted before all of the glue comes off naturally, the potential for 'spots' or streaking on the teeth from uneven whitening increases.  Therefore, I would suggest a minimum of three to four weeks before I would use any type of strong whitening outside of toothpaste.\n\n2) Despite all of the RELATIVELY expensive tooth whitening toothpastes on the market, you can use a simple home remedy of baking soda on your toothbrush after regular brushing.  This works as good, if not better than a toothpaste, and is cheaper.  It does not taste great though.  The problem with the 'painted on' whiteners is that they do not last very long, and over the long haul, they will cost A LOT to maintain.  The alternatives to bright white from Target or Wal-mart are effective, but do not last nearly as long as those that you can buy from your dentist (Brite White and Zoom).  While these are significantly more expensive than store brands, they will last one to two years without outside maintenance, and they are more effective.  You could also do an in-office whitening which speeds up the whitening process (1 afternoon vs. 2 to 3 weeks with Bright White), and costs roughly the same.\n\nToothpastes merely remove surface stains like coffee/smoke/food from chronic build-up over the years, and only work to 'whiten' them close to back to where they were before, but Zoom or BriteWhite will whiten them well beyond what you can get from a toothpaste or naturally.

What do you think about legal immigration? . Yesterday someone posted a question in which she described how legal immigration affected the United States. Her argument was that if immigration kept its current increase numbers, then by year 2030 the population would triple and that this would cause America to be a third world country. I have a problem with this, since I am a legal immigrant myself. What is your opinion? . I don't know who posted that question, but the premise is silly.  From an economic standpoint, America gains from immigration (legal and illegal).  \n\nThose that legally enter America do so because we are a land of opportunity.  They are able to apply their skills and talents to better themselves.  In the meantime, they are part of the population that find better ways of doing things (technological advances).  Technological advances increase everyones standard of living.  \n\nThose that come here illegally are hired by firms because of the cheapness of their labor.  This lowers the costs of products that all Americans buy.  If this wasn't true, then there wouldn't be an illegal immigration problem.  The government would have taken care of it long ago.  But, in the end, money talks so the political question on illegal immigration will not be decided in the near future.  There is a lot of disagreement over this.  Many people contend that illegal immigration overwhelms government programs costing the country more in services than their labor provides.  For myself, I wonder how much the American consumer has saved through lower prices compared to what they pay in taxes so the  government can pay for those services.  Granted individual states may experience problems, but my bet is that for the nation as a whole, the American consumer is the beneficiary.\n\nAs an example, our population recently went over 300 million people; a 20 million increase from 5 years ago.  This was attributed to immigration.  Has our standard of living gone down?  No, it has gone up.  That's because these people are working.  They increase our GDP.  Even if they do not provide for increases in knowledge and technological breakthroughs (which everyone does through specialization), the proportional split on GDP is the same as if they did not immigrate.   \n\nMy thoughts on illegal immigration are solely from an economic viewpoint.  From a societal, security, etc. viewpoint, I think we must stop illegal immigration.  I fully support legal immigration and believe it is a strength in America.\n\nSorry so long, but I can be a chatty bugger.	Politics & Government

"what makes someone wheeze when they are laying down making them wake up coughing? .  . Are you sure it's ""wheezing""?  Some people have orthopnea.  That is a condition in which it is difficult to breathe when lying down.  Some people have excess fluid in their body, and when they lay down, the fluid accumulates around the lung area and central abdominal area... which makes it harder to breathe. This would explain why the person would cough when they sit up.. the fluid is in the lungs.. and that is an autonomic response-- to cough the secretions out.  It may sound like wheezing.. but it may be ""crackles"" or ""rhonchi"" fluid rattling in the lungs.   Sometimes, weight plays an issue.  It can depend how much weight is pressing on the chest.. it compresses the lungs making it harder to breathe.  I suggest sleeping on several pillows to decrease the fluid in the lungs.. and/or the weight on the chest. I hope this helps!  :-)"	Health

how can i become a trangender and not be gay? .  . I think the difficulty in answering your question is that the term 'gay' is more a form of personal identification than it is of social identification.  If you are physically a man who considers himself a woman, but is attracted to men, he may not consider him/herself gay, because on the inside, he is a female.  Whether or not you're gay or male or female is defined by you and not by society.  Anthropologically speaking, male and female is purely speculative.  If you are unsure who you are or how you view yourself, I would definitely put any sort of surgery on the backburner.  That's one of those mistakes that is not easily remedied.  Just determine what 'gay' means to you, what gender you are and then you'll have your answer.  Furthermore... Remember that if you do determine that you are gay, there is absolutely nothing wrong with that.	Society & Culture

Then continue as if answering them.\n\nI have recently completed a course on mental heath and I learned that even for something as simple as spotted flecks in a carpet can look competly different to someone suffering from mental health issues.  A few of our service users would bend over and reach for the floor trying to pick things up that werent there.  Even talking to the floor as if a small animal was there.  This I learned was because the flecks in the carpet didnt appear as flecks to them.  They saw it as something else and this all depended on the indiviual.  Weve recently had a new carpet laid now.\n\nIf your in thissort of work and not had previous experience your company should really be sending you on courses to help give you this knowledge.  People with mental health issues may see and there things but they are still very bright.  They will see themselves as being normal, and its YOU with the problem.\n\nSpeak to your emplyer about courses hun.  It must be very scarey for you at times.  Ive worked with mental health now for 4 years and im still learning new things everyday.\n\nAs abit of advice......dont turn it into a joke with someone if they start talking funny or telling you someones there its not likly to turn out very well.  You can try ASKING them who they see or hear.  You can sometimes understand them more if they feel you want to understand and can be trusted.  If you feel a moment is getting abit heated try and dirvert there attention somewhere else.  If your in their home on your own ALWAYS make sure you keep the exit door behind you.  NEVER let the client be between you and the door.  If a moment becomes above what you can handle or you feel you need some air then you can exit quietly and easily.\n\nAnything your worried about email me arabsaigold@hotmail.com.

"WWJD? If Jesus did not have any children, then why do church attending people have more children? . The graph in the link shows a correlation between church attendance and family size in European and North American nations.\n\nhttp://www.nationmaster.com/plot/rel_chu_att/peo_hou_wit_mor_tha_5_peo/flag . Well, for basics, WWJD is more a ""marketing tool"" or buzzphrase than something to be applied in this context. \n\nThe goal was to have people examine how they treat others or how devoted they are to God, by comparing it to how Jesus treated others or how he related to God.\n\nObviously one can ""emulate"" Jesus in terms of the sort of moral behavior they exhibit, without having to be a Jewish man (kinda hard for the women), or being single, or being a wandering prophet, or having to be crucified by Romans -- just as you might personally have a role model for yourself, yet you only emulate his ATTITUDE and ways of relating to others and outlook on life, not necessarily all the details of that mentor's circumstances in life.\n\nAs far as having kids, secular thought (generally) is that you have to be careful with your resources, you have to remain in control of your life, you don't want to take on more responsibility than you can handle, and so forth. Kids are often ""fit into one's life"" rather than allowed to intrude randomly.\n\nThe conventional wisdom of general Christianity is that kids are a blessing and a gift from God (often quoted is the verse that ""Children are like arrows; blessed is the man whose quiver is full of them), and that one is denying the providence of God by removing any possibility of ever having kids. This is the reason that the Catholic church has that policy about ""no birth control,"" although it's often not followed by the US church. In any case, kids are considered gifts rather than inconveniences to one's career or happiness, more of the time. \n\n(Personally, I think there's a line to walk between giving God room to work and being reproductively responsible with one's given resources.)"

Why is yawning addictive? . If your in a group and one person starts yawning, why do others also start to yawn? . Yawning \n\n\nEveryone knows that we yawn more and for longer when we’re bored. That’s one of the reasons it’s so embarrassing. Males who are bored tend to have longer yawns than bored females. And most people assume that we do it because our bodies need more oxygen. That sounds sensible, doesn’t it? After all, when we’re bored or tired, we breathe more slowly, so less air goes through the lungs, so the brain signals the lungs to take a deep breath and so we yawn. The trouble is, even breathing enriched air, or exercising so that we breathe faster, makes no difference to how often we yawn. We don’t yawn because we need more air.\n\nWe can all agree on what a yawn is like though. It’s a very deep breath, taken with the mouth round and wide open. It ventilates all parts of the lungs, something which doesn’t happen with normal quiet breathing. The mouth opens fairly slowly, closing more swiftly. There’s usually a visible swelling of the throat, our eyes close and we lower our brows. Lots of animals appear to yawn, but many of the simpler creatures merely gape – opening the mouth wide and not taking a deep breath. Most mammals yawn just like us though. Scientists have tried hard to classify human yawns, but actually they all look the same. The only thing that changes is when we do it! There seems to be only two basic types; the ‘social yawn’, and the ‘wake-up’ yawn, which just seems part of our general stretching routine. \n\nAnd just like stretching, yawning is a reflex. It even occurs in animals that have been born without a correctly formed brain. But normally it’s triggered by stimuli like tiredness, the sight of others yawning or social stress. Yawning increases blood pressure and heart rate and also flexes muscles and joints. If you try to stifle or prevent it by clenching your jaws shut, a yawn is somehow less ‘satisfying’. For some reason, the stretching of jaw and face muscles is necessary. Yawning seems to keep the brain aroused in situations where sleep is unwanted, like in the early morning and when struggling to stay awake at night. It’s associated with high states of alertness – and stress or fear. At athletics events, you sometimes find participants in the race of their lives standing in the starting block and yawning. Or musicians as they psych themselves up before a concert.\n\nAll yawns seem to last about six seconds and are very difficult to stop once they get going. They really are infectious – it’s not just a coincidence. Studies have shown that forty to sixty percent of people who see a yawn end up by joining in. Yawning can be extraordinarily catching. Hearing one can trigger a yawn. Even sitting alone in a room thinking or reading about one can cause a yawn.\n\nWe have a brain mechanism that detects a yawning face – even in our imagination – and which then triggers the same behaviour. Once the neurological machinery in our head gets underway it’s hard to stop. But why? It seems that contagious yawning is caused by something very important to humans: empathy, the ability to identify with other people’s feelings. \n\nPeople who are particularly prone to contagious yawning also tend to score highly on tests that measure levels of empathy. They are people who are in-tune with what others may be feeling and contagious yawning suggests that they’re inclined, in certain situations, to unconsciously mimic their behaviour. They tend to be the same people who say ‘ouch’ when someone else stubs a toe or steps on a sharp object.\n\nThis ability to feel empathy for others is an important part of being human. It only develops when we are a year or so old – just like contagious yawning – and no animals show any signs of empathy whatsoever, except chimpanzees and orang-utans. It is a definite advantage to us as a species: binding social groups together through their feelings for one another and bringing individuals closer together.\n\nSome schizophrenics are unabl	Health

can anybody will explain what is john-teller effect in general? . i want to know abt. john teller effect. . It's Jahn-Teller effect, not John Teller.\n\nJahn-Teller distortions occur for transition metal complexes where by distortion of the molecule can result in a lower energy state for the molecule.\n\nIn transition metal chemistry, bonds from ligands to the central metal atom are coordinate covalent, i.e. both electrons come from one atom.  The orbitals which contain those electrons bond with usually the dz2 and dx2-y2 orbitals from the metal, but are lower in energy, so the orbitals based on the metal are essentially anti-bonding orbitals.  The dxz, dyz, and dxy orbitals are mostly non-bonding orbitals, but their energies do go up somewhat upon bonding interaction.  In a typical octahedral bonding arrangement, the dz2 and dx2-y2 are degenate, as are the dxz, dyz, and dxy orbitals (they have the same energy).  In certain electron configurations (the classic example is d9), if the system can make those orbitals non-degenerate by lengthening or shortening bonding interactions along a certain axis, it can lower the overall energy by putting electrons in lower energy orbitals, which is why you will often see Cu2+ complexes where some bond distances are longer than others.

What does it mean when something is prorated? . Dictionary.com doesn't give a good enough definition for me.  It doesn't have an example. . A good example is when you buy a new car battery.  Maybe for one whole year if that battery goes bad, they will replace it free. After the year, if the battery goes bad you will not get a free replacement but will get maybe 75% of the price of your battery. The longer you have the battery the less the replacement sum will be. It is prorated according to how long you have had the use of the battery versus how much more use you are guaranteed. A five year battery that goes bad in the first year will be prorated to give you a free battery or a pretty big portion of the cost of that battery. A five year battery that fails in the fourth year will be prorated according to the fact that this is a four year old battery with one more year of warranty. You might just get 25% of the value of a new battery.	Business & Finance

"who is the worlds best golf player is it tiger woods ? .  . No,the best golf player is none other then the great Arnold Palmer.I got this from http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arnold_Palmer,\nbut I just had to put it on here for you,because he is the greatest golfer of all time.\n\nArnold Daniel Palmer (born September 10, 1929) is an American golfer who has won numerous events on both the PGA TOUR and Champions Tour, dating back to 1955. He was born in the Pittsburgh suburb of Latrobe, Pennsylvania. Palmer is not generally regarded as the greatest player in history (most would give that accolade to Jack Nicklaus, some to Bobby Jones or Ben Hogan), but he is arguably golf's most popular star and its most important trailblazer because he was the first star of the sport's television age, which began in the 1950s.Palmer learned golf from his father, who was a golf professional at Latrobe Country Club. at age seven, Palmer broke 100. As a youngster, Palmer was only allowed on the Latrobe course (it was just nine holes then) in early morning or late afternoon, when the members weren't playing. He attended Wake Forest University from 1947 until 1954, taking time out for service in the United States Coast Guard. He left Wake Forest without earning a degree and briefly worked as a paint salesman but after winning the 1954 U.S. Amateur he turned professional and he won the Canadian Open the following year.\n\nPalmer's charisma was a major factor in establishing golf as a compelling television event in the 1950s and 1960s, setting the stage for the popularity it enjoys today. His first major championship win at the 1958 Masters cemented his position as one of the leading stars in golf and by 1960 he had signed up as pioneering sports agent Mark McCormack's first client. In later interviews McCormack listed five attributes that made Palmer especially marketable: his good looks; his relatively modest background (his father was a caddie and greenkeeper before rising to be club professional and Latrobe was a humble club); the way he played golf, taking risks and wearing his emotions on his sleeve; his involvement in a string of exciting finishes in early televised tournaments; and his affability. [1]\n\nPalmer is also credited by many for securing the status of The Open Championship (British Open) among US players. Before Palmer, relatively few American professionals attempted to play The Open due to its travel requirements, foreign environment, and the style of its links courses (radically different from most American courses). Palmer's successive Open wins in the early 1960s convinced many American pros that a trip to Britain would be worth the effort. Of course, the advent of transatlantic air travel by jet at about that time also contributed greatly to making The Open a more attractive tournament for American pros.\n\nHe has won seven major championships:\n\nThe Masters: 1958, 1960, 1962, 1964 \nUS Open: 1960 \nThe Open Championship: 1961, 1962 \nPalmer's most prolific years were 1960-1963, when he won 29 PGA Tour events in four seasons. In 1960, he won the Hickok Belt as the top professional athlete of the year and Sports Illustrated magazine's ""Sportsman of the Year"" award. He built up a wide fan base, often referred to as ""Arnie's Army"", and in 1967 he became the first man to reach one million dollars in career earnings on the PGA Tour. By the late 1960s Jack Nicklaus had acquired clear ascendancy in their rivalry, but Palmer won a PGA Tour event every year up to 1970, and in 1971 he enjoyed a revival, winning four events.\n\nPalmer was eligible for the PGA Senior Tour (now the Champions Tour) from its first season in 1980, and he was one of the marquee names who helped it to become successful. He won ten events on the tour, including five senior majors.\n\nPalmer won the first World Match Play Championship in England, an event which was originally organised by McCormack to showcase his stable of players. Their partnership was one of the most"	Sports
Why is the sweet flavor so good? . Why do humans (and other animals) perceive the sweet flavor as pleasant? . Sweet tastes good because sweetness in fruit is an indicator of ripeness, and ripe fruit is the most nutritious.  So, once upon a time, a sweet tooth was an evolutionary advantage -- those who enjoyed sweetness sought out the most ripe fruit and had the healthiest diets.  With healthier diets, they survived the longest and passed their genes on to the most offspring. \n\nIronic.  Our appreciation for sugar is actually rooted in good nutrition.\n\nToday, we have extracted sugar from fruit, and for a human being it is no longer conducive to a healthy diet.  In fact, our craving for sugar now has the opposite effect.	Science & Mathematics

"why the moon show the same face? .  . The answer is that the Moon's period of revolution (one orbit around the Earth) is the same as the Moon's period or rotation (one spin around it's axis). The result is that the Moon always keeps on side facing the Earth.\n\nThis phenomena is called ""tidal locking"" and occurs because, while the Moon generates tides in the Earth, the Earth also generates a tide in the Moon (in the solid rock). The Moon's tidal budge moves as the Moon rotates. The energy for this, and the gravitational effects from the distortion, lead to a braking effect. The Moon slows down its rotation until it is such that the buldge is on one side always faces the Earth.  Now the tidal bulge is stationary (facing the Earth) and no more braking occurs. \n\nThis is also related to why there are lot more Lunar Mare on the near side than the far side. The Moon's core is shifted slightly towards the Earth, so it was easier for lava seas to form on the near side.\n\nMany other satellites are tidally locked to their planet. Mercury is almost tidally locked to the Sun."	Science & Mathematics

My daughter wants to become a dentist. I didnt go to college, how does she start this process? . we live in GA, no one in our family has been to college. She is 17 and taking college prep classes at her high school. The counselors there are not very helpful. What can we do to find out what direction to go? . Good for you, for wanting to help her with this process!  Too many parents would just stand back and hope she could find a way to do this.  There are several ways you can approach this.  If you have a family dentist with whom she has a good relationship, she (or you) could ask her/him for help with the process.  There are many websites, like www.collegeboard.com, which give information - she needs to prepare for the SAT, if she hasn't already taken that exam, and she should get help with her essays and financial aid applications.  Be careful, by the way, about rip-off companies which take your money and promise financial aid; I've seen too many people taken in by these sleazy people.  Once she gets accepted at a college, they should be able to work with her to get financial aid that she (and you) doesn't have to pay for up front.  The suggestion about community college counselors was a good one, and if you have any money, there are professional independent college counselors you can get advice from.  I can tell you that I'm a college professor, and many of us love it when high school students who are interested in our fields come to us for advice.  I don't know enough about the sciences, or I'd volunteer to help her myself!	Education & Reference

"What is the most effective way to market an online business? . I am about to venture into starting an online business and feel overwhelmed with all the competition out there... Any tips on marketing schemes.... . The best way is to rank well in the search engines (organic search results, not the pay per click). SEs can be a big source of traffic. The key is to create the best content in your niche. If you have good content, other websites will gladly link to you and offer your site as a resource to their audience. Check the on-page factors and be sure to get linked from authority sites in your topic area.\n\nIf you're only going to read one how-to guide to get to the top of Google, the BEST and most comprehensive resource I found is WebmasterWorld.com's Brett Tabke's advice ""Successful Site in 12 Months with Google Alone"" http://www.webmasterworld.com/forum3/2010.htm\n\nOther ideas:\n\n1. Create the best content you can. Your content is your best advertisement - if visitors love your content, then they will go back and spread the word to others.\n\n2. Make it easy for users to recommend your site. Viral marketing is very important -- and easy to tap on the Web. But give your users the tools. Get a Recommend this Site script from websites such as cgiscripts.com and similar directories of scripts. Some even go as far as giving incentives to those who recommend the site to their friends. \n\n3. Send out press releases. While outfits charge as much as $650 per release, there are free press release submission places on the Web. Press releases allow you to (a) attract media attention; (b) get more back links to your website without sending each website an email request; and (c) get more visibility especially if your press release gets in Google News or Yahoo News. PRWeb and my website accepts free press release submissions, among others.\n\n4. Submit articles. Write articles and submit them to websites accepting author submissions. You get exposure for your business; establishes you as an authority in your field, and allows you to get backlinks for your website. Here is a VERY COMPREHENSIVE list of sites that accept article submissions  http://answers.yahoo.com/question/;_ylt=AqmzHU_wN2q8JvMJ6ttE0ewjzKIX?qid=1006022407481 \n\n5. Syndicate your content. Use blog or RSS feeds to distribute your content. Everytime you update your content, those who are receiving your RSS feeds will get the latest info from you as well.

what is cancer? .  . Cancer is a class of diseases characterized by uncontrolled division of cells and the ability of these cells to invade other tissues, either by direct growth into adjacent tissue (invasion) or by implantation into distant sites (metastasis). This unregulated growth is caused by damage to DNA, resulting in mutations to genes that control cell division. Several mutations may be required to transform a normal cell into a malignant cell. These mutations are often caused by chemicals or physical agents called carcinogens. Some mutations occur spontaneously, or they can be inherited (germ line mutations.)\n\nCancer can cause many different symptoms, depending on the site and character of the malignancy and whether there is metastasis. Cancer may be painless. A definitive diagnosis usually requires the histologic examination of tissue by a pathologist. This tissue is obtained by biopsy or surgery. Once diagnosed, cancer is usually treated with surgery, chemotherapy, or radiation.\n\nIf untreated, cancers may eventually cause death. Cancer is mainly a disease of later years, and is one of the leading causes of death in developed countries. Most cancers can be treated and many cured, especially if treatment begins early. Many forms of cancer are associated with exposure to environmental factors, such as tobacco smoking, alcohol, and certain viruses. Some of these can be avoidable, and public health and vaccination programmes are important on a global scale.	Health
"My mom was just diagnosed today with pancreatic cancer.  She is 82 years old.? . What do we expect?  My sister found her yellow skin, doubled over in pain and vomiting yesterday morning and they have been testing since.  they told us tonight the results.  they are doing another test now as I type to see how far she is.  She is not a complainer and does not like dr's so she has probaly been in pain for quite a while.  Any help with what to expect would be appreciated.  thanks . I'm very sorry to hear this, my sympathies go out to you and your family.\n\nMy father-in-law recently passed away from this type of cancer.  It runs in my husband's family as his father, grandfather and uncle were also diagnosed.\n\nMy husband's father was given 6 months to live by his doctors but he survived for 2 whole years.  He refused any radiation or chemotherapy, as he believed that it would have probably done more harm than good.  He did not want to go out that way, he wanted to be as strong as possible for as long as possible.\n\nHe was only 56 when he was diagnosed and 58 when he passed, so since your mother is older she may have different issues to deal with.  But my father-in-law was very active until only a few weeks before his passing.  The only hints that he was ill was the ever-increasing lump in his abdomen (his tumor), it's accompanying pain, and extreme weight-loss.  His pain got slowly worse as time progressed and at the very end he did take pain medications for it as it was quite bad.  The medications made him very confused and at the very end he didn't recognize anyone anymore and couldn't use the bathroom by himself.\n\nHe had a very interesting outlook on his sickness.  When he was diagnosed initially, he decided to spend his last days doing what he loved most - surfing.  He moved to Costa Rica for 8 months and when he didn't die, he decided to come home!  The only remedy he took the entire time - aside from the pain meds at the end - was his own urine!  Yes, it sounds crazy, but there is apparently some sort of urine-drinking therapy program he learned about and decided to try.  It sounded awful, but we couldn't argue with it, as it seemed to be doing something!  And he lived a year and a half longer than expected!\n\nMy husband's uncle who was also diagnosed 6 months after his father opted for chemo and radiation.  They think they caught his early because the tumor grew on a vital duct and gave him very bad jaundice very early on, so he noticed his symptoms right away.  He is recovering now and only experienced pain after his treatments started.  Most of his pain came from his surgeries and from his treatment making him so tired!  He is in his 40s.\n\nGrandfather was in his mid 80s and passed soon after being diagnosed.  Pancreatic cancer is very aggressive and took him quickly.  The only solace we took was in that he had lived a full, long, good life.  He wasn't in much pain because he was heavily medicated which also made him very confused.  He also lost a lot of weight.\n\nAs far as what you should expect ... it's different for everyone.  She is older which vastly decreases her chance of survival.  No matter what, it will cause her pain because of the tumor pressing on vital organs, and if she is on pain medication she will probably be very ""out of it"".\n\nThe one thing I want to say is that, if she is going to pass ... if you have anything you need to say to your mother, please tell her!  It's morbid but it's such a truth.  My husband couldn't find the words to express what he needed to say to his father, even after 2 years of preparation, and it hurt him so deeply.  Don't wait until it's too late.  Say anything you need to now while she is still aware and capable of communicating coherently.\n\nGod bless you and yours, I wish you the best."	Health

She's also extremely pale.\nDoes anyone know other sighs to watch for or have any other ideas of what this may be? Please pray for my baby girl.. . Symptoms\n\nSymptoms of leukemia depend on how much the cancer has grown and may include:\n\n    * Fevers and night sweats.\n    * Frequent or unusual infections.\n    * Weakness and fatigue.\n    * Headaches.\n    * Bruising of the skin and bleeding from the gums or rectum.\n    * Joint pain.\n    * Swelling in the belly or pain on the left side of the belly or in the left shoulder from a swollen spleen.\n    * Swollen lymph nodes in the armpit, neck, or groin.\n    * Decreased appetite and weight loss because you feel full and don't want to eat.\n\n\n\ni will pray for you. if the doctor you are seeing will not talk to you you should get second opinion. and if she does have leukemia (knock on wood) ya'll should come to st.jude childrens research hospital in memphis,tn. they provide housing and pay for everything(the medical bills, travel costs)\n\n\nThe chronic forms of leukemia often cause no symptoms until much later in the disease.

Giving up your parental rights? . I want the father of my unborn child to sign his parental rights over. I got him to sign on a contract we both wrote up one night, but later the next day, I was told it didn't mean anything unless it was notarized. After I explained that to him, he backed out. Is that true or can I still use that paper we both signed as legal? Can I do anything without him having to be present to get this done as soon as possible? Also...is there any other way that I can do this without having to go through court procedures? I know it's going to be hard to prove he's an unfit parent, but his morals and his life are screwed up badly and I don't want him in my child's life. The baby isn't born yet. I live in Illinois if anyone knows the law here. I've done some research and haven't really come up with too much. . My understanding is he can't legally give up his parental rights unless a Judge approves it in court.  This is because it's your baby's legal right to have access to both a father and a mother.  Even if the man doesn't want to be a father, your baby has legal rights.  For instance, child support.  Also, if something happened to the dad, and he died say in an accident that wasn't his fault, and his estate received a monetary settlement, your child would be legally entitled to share in that settlement   So, unless another man is willing to step in and adopt your baby and be your baby's legal father, a court will NOT take away the biological father's parental rights UNLESS he's determined by the court to legally be an unfit parent.  In other words, it's not your or his decision, but rather the court's decision, with the court's interest being what's in the best interest of the child.	Family & Relationships

Can job leaving notification period be more than 1 month? . I have a job offer that requires me to sign a contract in which one of the clause is to notify the employer 2-months in advance for terminating the job.\n\nMostly, what I have heard and seen in my 4 year career is that the notification period is of 1 month (4-weeks). . They can put anything they like but there is no law which says you have to go to work on any particuar days with or without a contract.  So they may be able to contract you to give 2 months notice and you can give them that but they can't make you work it.	Business & Finance
"What can we do to improve children's access to primary education, and improve the quality of education? . How can we affect change in school systems around the world so that our children are prepared to succeed in the 21st century? . The quality of education is hampered because teachers are now being asked to teach children the social skills that families used to promote.  Unfortunately, as a teacher, all too many times I have to deal with issues that have absolutely nothing to do with what I want to teach my kids.  Children's behavior stymies the amount and quality of teaching that goes on every day.  When reflecting upon what the major cause for this, I always go back to the lack of caring many parents have towards their child's education.  Our society has fallen into the ""it's all about me"" syndrome, and parents aren't doing their part.  Our government is now working at holding the schools accountable for what is taught and the academic success of the students attending, but until parents are held just as accountable, then our schools (especially those in the urban arenas) are going to continue to struggle.  Thanks for the question Joe."	Education & Reference
"wat r the unique survival tricks  developed by some insects.please explain by using examples.? . pleazzzzzzz answer the question in details and please give at least 6 examples or more than tht still its ok if u give 1 example and it shud be very detailed i need it urgently fr my hhw plss . Here's some starts at least.  You still have to fill in the details; that's what homework is for.  Sorry, kid.\n\nEight Ways to Survive:\n\n1.  Reproduction, or in this case fecundity.  Many insects will lay thousands or even millions of eggs, to help ensure that at least some of their offspring will survive.  Someone once figured out that if every egg laid by one housefly were to survive, and if they all grew up to lay their own eggs, and if all those eggs survived, and so on, within one year the entire earth would be covered 6 inches deep with houseflies.\n\n2.  Rapid adaptability to changing environments.  This is part of fecundity.  With all those offspring, the genetic changes (mutations) happen more frequently, and so if there are any changes in the environment they can adapt more quickly as a species.  An example is a kind of gray moth somewhere in England.  Their wing color was perfect for them to blend in with the gray barks of certain trees.  Then a coal factory was built nearby, and the soot began to darken the barks of the trees.  The gray-winged moths were easy marks for birds and other predators, but the offspring that happened to have darker wings had a better chance to escape.  Within just a few generations, all the gray moths had changed to dark moths.  When the factory eventually shut down, and the soot started to wash and wear off the barks of the trees, guess what happened?\n\n3.  Which brings us to camouflage (hiding).  There are some pretty amazing examples of insect camouflage.  Google ""katydid"" and ""stick insect"" for a start.\n\n4.  Speed.  There's a kind of spider that lives in the desert.  It goes up to the tops of sand dunes, trying to collect moisture from the morning air.  But if a predator comes along, it curls up its legs and rolls like a pinwheel down to the bottom.\n\n5.  Symbiosis -- that's where two different species help each other out.  Did you know that some kinds of ants are actually ranchers?  They take care of a smaller species of insect called aphids, protecting them and helping them find food.  In turn, the aphids secrete a liquid which the ants use as food for themselves.\n\n6.  Strength.  Most insects have exoskeletons -- instead of bones, they have a hard, armor-like exterior to protect themselves against attack.\n\n7.  Speed.  There's a good reason why flies, mosquitoes and other flying insects move so fast and erratically.  It makes it harder for birds to catch them.  And many insects that don't fly can hop through the grass pretty quick.\n\n8.  Nastiness.  Thee's also a good reason why so many insects look creepy and icky:  To scare off/gross out would-be predators.  If that doesn't work, many insects have weapons of their own, claws, fangs, even venom.\n\nThere, that should give you enough to start with, at least.  You're still going to have to do some research work on your own.  Otherwise it woldn't be ""homework,"" would it?  :o>"	Education & Reference

"Which nation is world best in culture? .  . That is a very difficult question.... Besides personal factors (""beauty in the eye of the beholder""), if one were to use some religious or spiritual criteria in this forum, there probably could be a basis for a consensus. History has shown that societies go through phases. Over-simplified: struggling, great, & past-their-prime. The Roman Empire is amazing history, Great Britain had a world empire, the USA has had a been a virtuous experiment... but it appears that the glory days, culturally, for USA is in the past. Whatever moral values one has (religious or secular), the direction of the government & entertainment (to name to major factors) has been going downhill since WWII. As have the developed countries, in general.\n\nI have wondered if I will want to stay in the US after I retire. It is becoming more & more difficult to maintain a Christian lifestyle - for even a nominal Christian - with all the worldly assaults & temptations, everywhere, all the time.\n\nSo the question becomes, for me, where do the people live in harmony with Christian values? (And, secondarily, have a healthy & pleasant environs.) I think I'll check Iceland... there is no heaven on earth - that's what I want."	Society & Culture

Do the easiest thing which is to let them sue in court for the amounts owed.\n   The creditors are filling in the cheques with larger amounts so that they can sue for larger amounts, hoping that the cheques will be proof that the amount is owed.\n    The burden of proof is on the creditors. If someone goes to court he must prove that your son actually owes the money that he's being sued for. While a cheque can be viewed as a form of proof, the fact is that the number amount filled in the cheque isn't in your son's handwriting and therefore the cheque loses it's value as proof.\n    The original loan agreement will have to be provided to the court, and that will have the correct amounts on it.

what is checkma8? .  . Checkmate (frequently shortened to mate) is a situation in chess (and in other boardgames of the chaturanga family) in which one player's king is under attack and there is no way to meet that threat; it is a check from which there is no escape. The king is never actually captured—the game ends as soon as the king is checkmated. A player who is checkmated loses the game. Delivering checkmate is the ultimate goal in chess (although not all games end in checkmate often a player resigns before checkmate is administered, or the game may end in a draw in several ways).

What is liquid pressure and Pascal's law of hydraulics? . Application of pascal's law . A liquid is said to be in equlibrium when no net external force acts on it.But in equlibrium condition its molecule as always are in random motion.These hav some maas and hence momentum(mxv).If now we assume an imaginary surface in liquid.These molecule collide with the surface an hece momentum change.Rate of change of momentum is force.And force on that particular area is Pressure(F/A).This pressure is manifested as liquid as liquid pressure\nPascal law states that if external pressure is exerted on any part of liquid then it is equally transmitted throughout the liquid.suppose we consider 2 points at same depth(at same depth pressure is equal).Point 1 has surface area A and 2 has surface area B,then if F force acts on A(i.e.Pressure=F/A) then this pressure will be transmitted to 2.since area of 2 is B so force experienced be F'(pressure=F'/B).Now mathamatically \n            F/A=F'/B	Science & Mathematics

Which country helped the USA to acheive independance from Britian? .  . France and Spain.\nSee the article below:\nAgents of the new nation (USA)—notably Benjamin Franklin, Arthur Lee, Silas Deane, and later John Adams—were striving to get help, and in 1777 Pierre de Beaumarchais had succeeded in getting arms and supplies sent to the colonials in time to help win the battle of Saratoga. That victory made it easier for France to enter upon an alliance with the United States, for which Franklin and the comte de Vergennes (the French foreign minister) signed (1778) a treaty. Spain entered the war against Great Britain in 1779, but Spanish help did little for the United States, while French soldiers and sailors and especially French supplies and money were of crucial importance.\n(Forign Aid)	Politics & Government

I was 17 and my mom hardly bought me clothes, make up or whatever.  me and my friend used to go to  target and ""take clothes"" and makeup until we got caught.  I was arrested and so was she- we got charged with burglary because the ammount of makeup  and clotheswe stole was over $300  (make us expensive).

All she needs is to get cuaght and that will teach her a lesson.  Hopefully she will learn it before she gets caught.

yeah i asked this but it was at night so i didn't get much anwers? . okay there is a girl i like but that ain't the problem, the problem is that i can't talk to her as much, okay it started out at the begining of the school year, we went to school with each other in elmentary so there wasn't as much people but now in middle school, there are more, much prettier people, and her friends are always near her so we can't talk, i only talk to her at least once a day( if my 6th period teacher lets me out on time) well now i can't use myspace, and i talk to her, alot on myspace but now i can't because my brother won't let me, i want to get her phone # but that is hard because she doesn't give it too anyone, only her friends that are girls. how do i talk to her more, plz if you know tell me, it is like i don't even know her anymore, our relationship is dieing, how could i get her phone #, do i give her my phone # or something, or do i give her a note, i'd do anything just to talk to her more . WOW! sloooow down there cowboy!.. \n- first off... treat your little lady with some respect.  she's young. if she doesnt want to give you her number it could be a number of things.. \n1. her parents keep track of who she talks to.. and she tries to hide that.. \n2.  she's not that interested.. \n3. Maybe she's just not sure about you. and how far she wants to let you go.\n\n- i mean.. you did say middle school, so its not like the world is over.\n\n\n- but... being one who went through this kind of thing, you have to learn to accept what comes at you.  you will find that it will be dissapointing. and one day.. she may jjust say, look pal- your cool and all but back off.  just accept that.\n\n= a good way to talk to her, is leave a little note with one of her friends.  dont let any juicy details out.. and say something like this.. \n\n - hey, i've really enjoyed talking to you... your a sweet girl.  id like to have your number so we could talk some more.

"If men are scared of marriage, why are most divorces filed by women? . Most stats I've seen indicate that 70-75% of divorces are filed by women.\n\nI've also seen stats that put infidelity by men at about 60% and infidelity by women at about 40%, with women catching up to the infidelity rate of men.\n\nSo why do you think women, who typically complain than men are afraid of comittment, seem to want divorce two to three times more than do men?\n\nIt seems to me that men are more comitted to marriage than women.  Comments? . Actually, you're right. Women ARE more likely to leave a marriage than a man. I read somewhere, long time ago (when my mom left my dad), something that said that women's needs change during the course of a relationship, while men's needs primarily stayed the same (and yes, this does include the phyiscal needs). \n\nFor example, a woman who falls in love and marries a man because he has an exotic job may decide five years later that the job ""isn't enough"" because she now needs someone who can be at home at 5:15 every single night to help take care of the kids. Her needs changed; his didn't. She married him because she ALSO loved the job - not just him - and now she doesn't love the job any more, and so, by consequence, she no longer loves him. Irreconcilable differences, you know.\n\nMen, on the other hand, will fall in love and marry a woman who happens to HAVE an exotic job. If she then decides to stay home and have kids, he will often stay dedicated to her because he ""made that commitment"" and will stay the course. If he does stray - as you admit some men do - it's often because the woman's needs have changed... and half the time, she's straying, too!\n\nMen also have been taught by their fathers, over the generations, that women are to be cared for (which I agree with) no matter what. Even though women were ""liberated"" 30 years ago, men are still being taught this value, and apparently they're listening! Women have taken this ""liberation"" and used it to their advantage as a gender, allowing themselves the freedom of escaping from home responsibilities that men have shouldered for centuries.\n\nNow... that's my opinion.... anyone else?"

And a convinient proof text for anti-gay marrage types. What do you think? . Who else was there to preform the ceremony if they were the first humans?  \nI guess someone will say ""god married them"" well then why do we need to get married in a religious ceremony or civil ceremony, why not just say ""god married us--prove us wrong.""\nI think gay people should be able to get married.

Maintenance therapy may be given to people at high risk of developing depression, since depression often recurs:\n\n    * Once a person experiences a single episode of depression, he or she has a 50% chance of having another.\n    * With two episodes, the chance of recurrence rises to 70%.\n    * With three episodes, the chance of developing depression again is 90%.\n\nMaintenance therapy is used based on the theory that continuing the medication after an initial episode of depression may prevent or lessen the intensity of a subsequent episode.

How to better develop my college studying skills? .  . This is what helped me through college:\n-sit in the front of the class (for less distractions)\n-take good notes\n-go over the notes at home, make sure you understand your notes, and attend office hours if you have questions. Sometimes I even recopied my notes\n-for math, I liked to work on the sample problems in the book before attempting the homework.\n-study groups help a lot. when you teach someone something you actually learn it better...and hopefully, someone else can help you out.\n-find time to relax and unwind. don't study 100% of the time.\n-avoid all nighters, plan ahead and manage your time wisely\n-just remember you are paying for college and it's not free. each class you miss is equivalent of several hundred dollars. Teachers don't care if you attend or not (this isn't highschool anymore)\n\nBottom line is, the 4-5 years you work hard in college will pay huge dividends when you are out in the work force. I have seen companies that only interview students with a 3.0 or greater GPA. I have also seen many people waste their lives away partying,smoking, etc...and getting kicked out. It's sad to see.\n\nBest of luck to you!	Education & Reference

Would a compass work in space? .  . Deep inside the earth, there is a spinning molten core of iron. This iron creates a huge magnetic field which surrounds the earth. The field protects us from deadly radiation waves from the sun. It also makes the Earth act like a giant magnet - so, the tiny free-spinning magnet aligns itself with the earth, pointing to the North and South Poles.\n\nNow if you went somewhere out in space, away from earth, the needle wouldn't feel the pull of the earth's magnetic field, and wouldn't point to north.\n\nThe answer is no.

a person with emphysema taking pure oxygen under respiratory distree can be fatal...why? . I am preparing an essay for an Anatomy course and need some direction on where to find info. . Okay...lets see if I can make this simple in explanation.  There is a chemo receptor in the medulla of the brain that regulates respiratory rate according to the amount of carbon dioxide in the blood.  A person with a more advanced emphysema has a difficult time breathing in enough oxygen and expelling enough co2 (carbon dioxide).  The problem that begins to happen is the retention of co2 and when the co2 gets high enough, the chemo receptor regulating respirations is knocked out of commission.  The only thing that keeps a person breathing is air/oxygen hunger.....keeping the oxygen in the body low enough that the oxygen hunger makes the person work to breath.  The challenge in oxygen therapy is to supply enough oxygen so a person can function, but not enough to supply the full oxygen needs of the body.  If the full needs of oxygen are supplied, the body will not work to breath and if the co2 is high enough to knock out the chemoreceptor....the person will no longer breath.  A loose way of calculating the percentage of oxygen with a person using a nasal cannula is this....and mind you, this is an aproximate.  Using a nasal cannula, figure 4% per liter...2 lpm=8%.  Add the percent of o2 therapy to 21% room air.  So, if a person is using o2 at 2 lpm=8%, added to 21% room air o2, you get aproximately 29% oxygen being used.	Health

Help! Does fruits make one fat? . I am watching y weight and one of the advice that I got is 2 eat 5-6 times a day which consists mainly of fruits and vegetables. But I discovered that I am adding weight instead of loosing it and my boyfriend said its because of the fruits (i.e. the fruits are making me fat), but I only take 2 oranges and 1 apple a day. Are they (oranges and apple) responsible for my weight gain? Help! . Hi Cleopatra!\n\nFruit and veggies don't cause weight gain, eating more calories then  you burn does.  Thus, I suggest you keep to the 5 meals per day, but keep your total calorie intake to 1500.  Then stay active: dance, shop, walk, play, etc.  Simple rule, fruit has more calories than veggies, so error on that side.\n\nThe should get you started where you could start to see progress within the week if you stick to it.\n\nI believe this answers your question, but if not, you can shoot me an email at: gregg@leandownsite.com\n\nGood luck on your diet and fitness goals!\n\nTrainer Gregg\nYou can achieve anything you set your mind on	Health

It affects the Central Nervous System and cause euphoria, dizziness, confusion,depression, headache, vertigo, hallucinations, seizures, vision problems ,stupor, and coma. It may have direct on the Cardiac System. It can cause bronchial spasms and suffocation. Long-term exposure can damage the liver, kidneys, and skin. Inhaling this solvent can even cause abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting. \nI have personally known people who had used it as a 'high' (sniffing correction fluid). They were in a mental hospital facility and had permanent brain damage. They had difficulty speaking. Their symptoms were like those of alcoholics with 'wet brain'.

"Why would someone incorporate in Delaware, but their business is based in another state? .  . Because they are foolish.  An out of state (DE) corporation will have to qualify to do business in the state where it maintains its business office.  Typically that costs as much as incorporating in the home state in the first place.  So you end up paying double to start & again year after year & maybe paying for a registered agent in DE when you can be your own for free.  Most businesses should incorporate in the state where they intend to do business & where they have their employees. \n\nThe only real ""advantages"" of a DE incorporation are for public companies doing business in multiple jurisdictions."

estimate the temerature at altitudes of 10,000, 15,000, 24,000 and 30,000 feet? .  . This is not a mathematics question .. as there is no condition given .. however, I estimate it based on the following assumptions:\n\n1. More you go up, temp will fall.\n2. While travelling by air, (at 35,000 feet) outside temperature is around - 15 degree celcious. (this might vary from place to place and season to season though)\n3. Assume the temperature at ground level (altitude = 0) 30 degree celcious (this will vary from place to place though)\n\nnow we have two points\n\naltitude = 0, temp = 30 degree celcious\naltitude = 35,000 feet, temp = - 15 degree celcious\n\nso for an altitude difference of 35,000 feet temp drops by 45 degree celcious\n\nThe rough estimate could be done like this:\n\nfor 10,000 feet altitude difference, temp will fall by (45/35000)*10000 or 12.85 degree. So temp at 10,000 feet altitude will be 17.15 degree celcious\n\nfor 15,000 feet altitude difference, temp will fall by (45/35000)*15000 or 19.28 degree. So temp at 15,000 feet altitude will be 10.72 degree celcious\n\nfor 24,000 feet altitude difference, temp will fall by (45/35000)*24000 or 30.86 degree. So temp at 24,000 feet altitude will be -0.86 degree celcious\n\nfor 30,000 feet altitude difference, temp will fall by (45/35000)*30000 or 38.57 degree. So temp at 30,000 feet altitude will be -8.57 degree.	Science & Mathematics

It's considered acceptable to round off a decimal in this fashion.\n\nWhen to Round Up\nRounding up means that we increase the terminating digit by a value of 1 and drop off the digits to the right. If the next place beyond where we are terminating the decimal is greater than or equal to five, we round up. For example, if we round 5.47 to the tenths place, it can be can be rounded up to 5.5.\n\nWhen to Round Down\nIf the number to the right of our terminating decimal place is four or less (4, 3, 2, 1, 0), we round down. This is done by leaving our last decimal place as it is given and discarding all digits to its right. For example, if we round 6.734 to the hundredths place, it can be rounded down to 6.73.

Thanks for your help. . Depending on where in Canada you would like to get a job as a nurse because each province has a College of Nurses. You would have to contact them and find out all the requirements to become licensed in that province. In Ontario you can contact the College of Nurses on their web site as follows- www.cno.org. I know this because I am a nurse in Ontario. I noticed at the end of your question you stated ""job in USA"". I know each that they have a similar system to ours in regards to licensing. You'd have to contact that states specific ""college"" as well. I hope this can help you somewhat to get you started towards your goal. Good luck!!!"	Health
"K-12 Teacher to Corporate/Technical Trainer? . Hello,\n\nI am curious if any former K-12 Teachers have switched careers from public teaching to corporate training/technical training.  I am currently a high school computer/business education instructor with a plethora of technical expertise.  Sadly, my school finds it of no use and only wants to target ""No Child Left Behind"" standards.  What are some similarities and differences between the positions?  Working conditions?  Expectations?   Are you earning more in your salary?  Opportunites for growth?  Any help on this would be appreciated.  \n\nThanks,\nKevin . One of the biggest hurdles you face is having been a teacher, oddly enough.  The corporate world in general doesn't see teaching as a happy match of personalities.  Rightly or wrongly, the corporate world sees a teacher as someone who made the decisions, as opposed to following others' decisions and, to a degree, an isolationist. It is a hard transition to make, not because of your actual talents, but in the way they preconceive you.\nCorporations like to see evidence of being a team player, following orders and working well in a hierarchy.  Fortunately, depending on the number of years you have been in school, it is not something you cannot overcome.  \nI taught for three years during the time I got a masters degree and when I moved into the corporate world, people were really afraid I was going to start telling them how to do everything. Maybe to some degree they were right.  Worse, it took me a long time to discover their preconception!!  I pass it to you in the hope that you might profit by it.\nMy advice to you is to find work in a small business in your spare time just for the experience, even if the job is somewhat beneath your skill level.  You want to have experience in being a ""team player.""  That way you can tell them you were trying it out to make sure that's what you wanted to do.\nKeep in mind that when you are making any obvious transition, people are afraid you will chuck it all and return to it.    The key question on the interview will be, ""Why do you want to change professions?""  If you say you are tired of teaching and all the hassles, they will nail you to the wall.  Tell them something about how much you enjoyed teaching in schools, but that you are ready for greater challenges that only come in climbing the corporate ladder.\nSometimes, if you manage to get one of those corporate jobs,  you have to take extra crap just to alleviate their fears.  Whatever you do, never give anyone, even in confidence, any reason to think that you ever think about going back."	Education & Reference

How do you if you should get a junior racket or full size racket?? .  . Most racquet manufacturers that make junior models match racquet length to age. The attached link recommends a full-size between age 10-12 or when the junior player reaches a weight of 85 pounds. I played competitive junior tennis and switched to a full-length racquet when I was 11, but that was when juniors still played with low-tech racquets. \n\nIn general, you can go with a full-size racquet as long as the length doesn't interfere with stroke mechanics and the player can handle the weight. Sticking with a junior racquet for too long could encourage the player to hit with too much arm and wrist, and not enough hip and shoulder. \n\nBest recommendation is to go to a local pro-shop, get some current tips, and demo a bunch of racquets with varying lengths. Pick the one closest to the full-size that still feels comfortable.	Sports

"What is the best way to get the people in the west to understand Islam better and be fair with it? .  . The very first thing to do would be to controll the people that claim to represent Islam. As long as any group is perceived to be violent, racist, and criminal because of the people that represent it, other people will continue to see it that way. You can't burn down a man's house, and rape his daughter, kidnap his wife and torture his son on T.V. and expect people to understand your ""good side"" Your religion as a whole needs to excomunicate the criminal faction, and refuse to allow them to call themselves followers of the true islam.

What is your favorite romantic film and why? . Please list title of film, some details if you like, and why this is your all-time favorite! . Phantom of the opera. It's about a man who was born with a deformity and lives under an opera house. He teaches a girl, Christine, to sing beautifully, and falls in love with her. Then Christine kind of falls in love with a childhood sweetheart, but the phantom (that's the man under ground) keeps trying to get Christine to himself. In the end, he lets Christine go with Raoul (the childhood sweetheart) out of love. Christine should definitiley ave gone with the phantom. He was so passionate, and he was never loved by anybody. It's my all time favorite because it's so sad, and because it's such a fantastic story, and the music is great. Good enough? Hope it wasn't too long for you!	Entertainment & Music

I'm not familiar with that specific game, but most games have minimum requirements for the PC they are to be played on. You can usually get away with being close to those specs if you don't meet them outright, by lowering the levels of eye candy (resolution, anti-aliasing, available features and detail levels, etc.) but the game may simply require more than your video card can provide. In unusual cases a really fast computer can provide some of the capabilities of the graphics card in the CPU, but you'd probably have a fast graphics card to match a fast CPU anyway.\n\nThe 16MB of the video card speaks to how large a texture map it can hold -- the texture map is an image that gets draped over a surface in the game by the video card to make it appear more detailed and complex then it really is. Since your error message says ""MISSING TEXTURE"" I'd have to believe it didn't have enough room in the available RAM on the video card to hold the surfaces it needed to apply in the game.

I think that if your in a relationship and your serious that eventually you'll feel alright to do those things. I dont think that any girl is nasty for doing this.

Teacher abuse...? . My bad for the last question. I guess it didn't go through. anyways. A friend of mine's son was hit (backhanded) by a teacher last week. What can be done about that and whats the max that can happen to a teacher who does that? . This is what normally happens.  First, the principal must be notified.  The principal is required to notify the district office and the department of education.  The principal will take statements from the student, the teacher and any witnesses.  Those findings are reported back to the district office and the department of ed.  Depending on those findings, the teacher can be placed on adminstrative leave while the department of ed investigates.  The deaprtment of ed can either let the teacher keep their job or can revoke the teacher's certificate.  Criminal charges may also be filed, but that's a whole different deal.  Once the department of ed makes a decision, that's the end.	Politics & Government

What is a sea wave and how is it made? .  . Ocean surface waves are surface waves which occur at the surface of an ocean. They are mechanical waves that propagate along the interface between water and air; the restoring force is provided by gravity, and so they are often referred to as surface gravity waves. As the wind blows, pressure and friction forces perturb the equilibrium of the ocean surface. These forces transfer energy from the air to the water, forming waves. In the case of monochromatic linear plane waves in deep water, particles near the surface move in circular paths, making ocean surface waves a combination of longitudinal (back and forth) and transverse (up and down) wave motions. When waves propagate in shallow water, (where the depth is less than half the wavelength) the particle trajectories are compressed into ellipses. As the wave amplitude (height) increases, the particle paths no longer form closed orbits; rather, after the passage of each crest, particles are displaced a little forward from their previous positions, a phenomenon known as Stokes drift. A good illustration of the wave motion is given by *Prof. Robert Dalrymple Java applet.	Education & Reference

is it possible to develop an allergic reaction to gold, when you have never had a problem before? . i have been wearing my wedding band for 2 years now, and never had a problem, now i get these itchy bumps around my finger and it swells up. could i possibly be developing an allergic reaction now? also, i wear my engagement ring on my other hand and that finger is just fine, the engagement band and the wedding band are both 14 karat white gold. why would that band be ok and not the other? . What is White gold?\n\nWhite gold is an alloy of gold and some white metals such as silver and palladium. White gold can be 18ct, 14ct, 10ct or any karat. For example, 18ct yellow gold is made by mixing 75% gold (750 parts per thousand) with 25% (250 parts per thousand) other metals such as copper and zinc. 18ct white gold is made by mixing 75% gold with 25% other metals such as silver and palladium. So the amount of gold is the same but the alloy is different.\n\nTraditionally nickel was used in white gold, however, nickel is no longer used in most white gold made today as nickel can cause reactions with some people. We generally do not use or sell nickel in our white gold.\n\nWhen white gold rings are new they are coated with another white metal called Rhodium. Rhodium is a metal very similar to platinum and Rhodium shares many of the properties of platinum including its white color.\n\nThe rhodium plating is used to make the white gold look more white. The natural color of white gold is actually a light grey color. The Rhodium is very white and very hard, but it does wear away eventually. To keep a white gold ring looking its best it should be re-rhodium plated approximately each 12 to 18 months. \n\n \n\nWhy am I allergic to some gold jewelry? \n\nEvery year we get a few customers who believe that they cannot wear gold jewelry because they get an allergic reaction to it. Some believe that they are allergic to gold. We have never yet known anybody who was allergic to pure gold, and seems very unlikely as gold is inert and not active in the sense of corrosion or decomposition over time, nor is it acidic.\nThe most common cause of allergic reactions to jewelry is nickel contained in the alloy. Nickel is, or was, frequently used in white gold alloys because it is inexpensive, hard, and has a strong whitening effect. Better quality white gold alloys use palladium, which has excellent properties but is more expensive. \n\nCommonest Causes\nThe next commonest cause of allergies for jewelry wearers appears to be detergent or other chemicals which lodge between the jewelry, usually rings, and the skin. Hairdressers are often affected. Rinsing well can help, but it is probably best to remove rings before using any troublesome chemicals, and use a barrier cream. \n\nOther Causes\nA few jewelry wearers still seem to be slightly allergic to yellow gold's, nickel cannot be the cause because it is not used in yellow gold alloys. In most cases sufferers only experience problems with low gold content alloys such as ten carat, so upgrading to a better alloy such as eighteen carat usually solves all problems. \n\nHigher Carat Gold\nThe other common components of ten carat gold alloys are copper, silver and zinc. Zinc is usually very well tolerated, it is used in many medical preparations. Silver and copper do not usually cause allergic reactions, but both will form compounds with atmospheric pollutants which may be the cause of some reported problems. When copper and silver are present in high carat alloy such as eighteen or twenty two carat, they are more resistant to attack by chemicals, because they are bound more closely with the gold content, and this will explain why high carat alloys cause fewer problems. \n\nAnti-Perspirants\nStrange as it may seem, but using anti-Perspirants can exacerbate metal allergy problems. It has been found that the sweat of a healthy person in a sauna can contain 20 times the nickel content of blood plasma, this may help to explain why exercise can improve health. Anti-Perspirants can reduce the bodies natural way of eliminating heavy metals. Healthy natural lifestyles tend to improve health, whereas unnatural practices can cause problems.	Health

This is a bully tactic and would land her in mediation. That's what they did in my school when they were cracking down on school violence.  Mediation is a session where you, a counselor and the bully engage in 'peace talks' to get to the root of the problem. Most people who went to mediation came out best of friends. If your school doesn't do this, maybe you can emplore your school's dean for such a program because this is really distracting you from your education.	Family & Relationships

"can any one tell me the story of the hatred between austin and mcman family? . i want to know the reason of it\nis there a site has photos of that . It all started when Owen Hart pile-drived Austin in an Intercontinental bout. After this, Austin was seriously hurt and did not had medical clearance to wrestle. Austin wanted to get back at Owen so bad that in order to get another match with him he offered to kiss his ass if he didn't beat him. \nOwen accepted but before the match took place, first Sgt Slaughter who was the commissioner at the time tried to talk Austin out of it getting a Stunner for his trouble, then Long time pal Jim Ross tried to persuad Austin not to wrestle, Austin notched his head as if he had understood but instead gave Old JR a taste of the Stunner too. Finally it was Mr. McMahon's turn to talk to the ratllesnake telling Austin ""Please, these fans and all of us care about you and we don't want to see you get hurt"". 'm sure you know where this ended. Stunner again and this is the actual incident that began the feud between these two. Actually, this is the reason why Vincent K. started to get in the ring anyway. Up 'till then we only saw his face doing announcing and stuff.\n\nAnyway, then Stone Cold won teh Rumble and went on to Wrestlemania to defeat HBK for the title, with Iron Myke Tyson as a guest referee. He even had an altercate with Iron Mike just before Wrestlemania but it was all BS since Tayson knocked out HBK and ended up costing him the belt.\n\nWe'll there's the short story...Now I think I need to go do something else besides wrestling.\n\nOn second thought...I don't care what people thinks.

"I have a phobia of being tickled. Am I alone here? . I am extremely ticklish everywhere with emphasis on the bottoms of my feet. All someone has to do is touch me or even look at me with intent and I get all jumpy and nervous. I really hate it sometimes. My feet are so ticklish that I can't even walk on grass unless I have shoes on. It's horrible. . I don't think that you are alone but I also know that there are many people who claim to be insanely ticklish and LOVE to be tickled to their limits and beyond.\n\nI picked up an a key phrase, ""I really hate it sometimes.""  If I am reading it correctly, you want to be able to enjoy it more but you are so ticklish that it sometimes scares you and sometimes people just take advantage of you and you hate that.\n\nIf there is a person in your life that wants to tickle you and you want to accommodate - you can build up to it and learn to not only take it but also enjoy it quite a bit.\n\nHave him/her massage your feet firm enough were it does not hurt and not soft enough to tickle.  Then let him/her GENTLY drag their fingers across your feet.  Fight the urge to say ""NO"" or ""STOP"".  Instead, while you are laughing, say ""IT TICKLES!!! IT TICKLES!!!"" or ""I'M TICKLISH!!! I'm TICKLISH!!!""  Soon, you will find yourself enjoying the tickling and taking it longer and longer.  If you need an air break, let them know.  If they respect you they will give the the air breaks you need.\n\nIf somebody tickles you and you do NOT want them to tickle you, let them know that you find their tickling to be very disrespectful of you and your feelings.  If they have a conscience, they will not tickle you again.\n\nI hope that this helped."	Family & Relationships

why are limits to infinity considerably important? .  . Limits to infinity can give you the upper or lower bound of a function.  In other words they can give you a horizontal asymptote for the graph of a function.  It will tell you that a quantity will get no higher (or lower) than this value.\n\nAlso, limits to infinity are used to compute infinite integrals.  An amazing example is the area between the graph of y = e^(-x) from x=0 to infinity and the x-axis.  You might think that the area is infinite since the x values go from 0 to infinity, but actually the answer is 1 sq. unit.	Science & Mathematics

find lose title to manufactured housing? . sell house i have know title .it a manufactured house.help . Title does not automatically qualify it as a motor vehicle.  Houses have title as well.  The title is tied to the property and the deed is the proof of ownership.  You can contact your local city/state agency or call a title company and they will be able to help you find what you need (for a fee of course!)  I don't think auntiegray really understands the question.  Do not go to Motor Vehicles if you do not have a motor home.  Manufactured housing does not necessarily mean motor home.  You do not have the DEED for your property.  You physically transfer the deed whan selling a home, the title stays with the house.  If you are going thru professional channels to sell this house i.e. a realtor, broker, or lender, they can refer you to a title company/attorney who will do that for you and you do not have to waste a lot of time trying to track the deed down.\n\nGOOD LUCK!

How do you get rid of nervousness? . What ever the reason, is there anything you can do to get rid of that rock-in-the-gut feeling of being nervous? . Don't look for a quick solution like medications (unless if you consider your nervousness bad enough to need medications as a side treatment). The answer for the relief of nervousness, same as any other psychological problem, is to find out what is causing it. What goes through your mind when this is happening? Monitor your thought patterns. Don't try to change anything or think or feel differently, that only makes things worse. Your only job is to realise what is happening, what goes through your mind exactly. At times this will give you an instant relief. At other times the problem is much deeper and more chronic, and realising what you are thinking does not make the problem go away straight away. But even though you may not realise it, doing this will gradually make those forces inside you weaker and weaker everytime you monitor those thoughts. After a while you will realise that the nervousness is not that intense anymore and if you keep going it will be completely resolved. \n\nUsually monitoring your thoughts will give you MUCH MUCH more than you bargained for. Realising one little thing could lead to realising other things and before you know it you can have much more overall life satisfaction...	Health

How do I stop being so paranoid about stuff and get some sleep? . My wife has a male friend that she talks to all the time and I did believe at one time that she might be fooling around with him, but I don't think that's true.  Anyway, she is gone away for a week and all I can think about is if she is with him doing stuff.  I think I know in my heart that she isn't, but my gut says she might be.  I am working shift work right now and when I get home I am exhausted but I can't seem to sleep because I worry about that.  I am really paranoid.  Is there anything I can do to stop my constant worrying and get some sleep that I desperately need. . Get a new outlook on things, I use to worry like that for 15 years..........Man life is to short. OK just say she is, what would you do???????? You would go on, cry for while, be miserable for a while, feel like you were gonna die for a while, but eventually you would go on. Maybe it would be even better next time. Surely you wouldn't consider suicide. Nothing is that bad!!!!!!! Now, say she is not or never did it was just your insecurities playing tricks on you.. I have those tricky monsters too. And every time I've listened to them I have been wrong, and ended up feeling really stupid it ruined my first marriage. I just started imagining stuff and it was a miserable life, after years I had messed it all  up and it was unrepairable we ended up divorced. I remarried and my new life is so much lighter and real. So that's probably the case now you are being paranoid. Go to sleep!!!!!!!! Just find out the facts tomorrow and stop jumping to conclusions it can ruin a good marriage!!!!!!!!!!!!	Health

What if Maldives had gone down into depth of ocean? . 1,620 cubic meters? \n\nIn a second ...\nglacier in Greenland is melting in the volume of 1,620 cubic meters.\nHaving gone the snow of Kilimanjaro disappear, Maldives could sunk in the blue ocean.\nIf gone, then still beautiful Maldives was, that you think? . Maldives\nI  INTRODUCTION \n\nMaldives (Diveti Rajje ge Jumhuriyya), island republic in southern Asia, located in the northern Indian Ocean, south-west of the southern tip of India. The Maldives is made up of a chain of nearly 2,000 small coral islands that are grouped into clusters of atolls. It has a total land area of 298 sq km (115 sq mi). The capital and largest city of the Maldives is Malé.\n\nII  LAND AND RESOURCES \n\nThe islands are low-lying and have only small tracts of arable land. Vegetation is dominated by coconut palms and breadfruit trees. The principal natural resource is the marine life of the surrounding seas. \n\nA  Climate \n\nThe climate is tropical and humid. The average annual temperature is 26.7° C (80° F), with little seasonal variation. The average annual precipitation is 1,524 mm (60 in), most of which falls between May and November.\n\nB  Environmental Concerns \n\nWith 80 per cent of the nation less than 1 metre (40 in) above sea level, the problem of global warming and resultant rising sea levels is a growing concern in the Maldives. The devastating Indian Ocean tsunami that hit the islands on December 26, 2004, flooded large areas of the islands. Significant population growth has led to overfishing around the islands, and the natural supply of fresh water is nearly exhausted.\n\nIII  POPULATION \n\nThe Maldives has a population of 339,330 (2004 estimate), yielding an average population density of 1,131 people per sq km (2,930 per sq mi). The most populous atolls are Malé, the capital and principal commercial centre, with a population of 84,000 (2001 estimate); Suvadiva; and Tiladummati. There are 20 political divisions based on the atolls: Alifu, Baa, Dhaalu, Faafu, Gaafu Alifu, Gaafu Dhaalu, Gnaviyani, Haa Alifu, Haa Dhaalu, Kaafu, Laamu, Lhaviyani, Malé, Meemu, Noonu, Raa, Seenu, Shaviyani, Thaa, and Vaavu. The people are ethnically heterogeneous, incorporating Indian, Sinhalese, Arabian, and African elements. Life expectancy in 2004 was 62 years for men and 65 years for women.\n\nA  Religion \n\nIslam is the state religion; nearly all the people are Sunni Muslims.\n\nB  Language \n\nThe language is Divehi (Maldivian), an Indo-European tongue related to Sinhalese.\n\nC  Culture \n\nDivehi culture predominates and the best-known music-and-dance form is the bodu beru (Divehi; “big drum”). Participants include a lead singer and drummers as well as other percussionists and the tempo of the music and dance rise to a frenzied crescendo. Another form of dance, performed by women, is the bandiyaa jehun. The rhythm is tapped out on water pots. There is a National Museum of local exhibits at Malé.\n\nIV  ECONOMY \n\nThe Maldivian economy is dominated by fishing and fish products, which accounted for almost 85 per cent of all export trade in 1993, and tourism. The fish catch is primarily tuna; corals and shells are also harvested. Coconuts are the principal agricultural product; most food must be imported. Industrial activity is largely limited to fish-processing and garment-manufacturing.\n\nA  Tourism \n\nThe rapid growth of the tourist industry has necessitated improvements in the infrastructure of the country, such as the installation of telephones and other forms of communication. Tourism is the principal foreign currency earner for the Maldives, with approximately 485,000 tourist arrivals recorded in 2002. Earnings from tourism totalled US$38 million in 1997. Malé International Airport is the major point of arrival for tourists.\n\nB  Currency and Banking \n\nThe monetary unit of the Maldives is the rufiyaa, made up of 100 laari (12.69 rufiyaa equalled US$1; early 2004). Currency is issued by the Maldives Monetary Authority.\n\nV  GOVERNMENT \n\nThe Maldives is a republic governed under a constitution promulgated in 1968 and revised in 1997, with effect from 1998. The president is both chief of state and head of government and is elected every five years by the parliamentary assembly and	Education & Reference

Unless your BMI is greater than 33, you should strive for no more than 2 pounds per week for permanent weight loss.  If your BMI is greater than 33, you may be able to lose more but should seek the guidance of a certified personal trainer or exercise specialist.  \n\nBest thing to do is just calculate your BMR (Basal Metabolic Rate) & AMR (Active Metabolic Rate) to give you a rough idea of your daily calorie expediture.

"How did they built the Eiffel Tower? .  . The structure was built between 1887 and 1889 as the entrance arch for the Exposition Universelle, a World's Fair marking the centennial celebration of the French Revolution. It is located at geographic coordinates 48°51′29″N, 2°17′40″E. The tower was inaugurated on 31 March 1889, and opened on 6 May. Three hundred workers joined together 18,038 pieces of puddled iron (a very pure form of structural iron), using two and a half million rivets, in a structural design by Maurice Koechlin. The risk of accident was great, for unlike modern skyscrapers the tower is an open frame without any intermediate floors except the two platforms. Yet because Eiffel took good care of his workers with movable stagings, guard-rails and screens, only one man died, during the installation of Otis Elevator's lifts.\n\nThe tower was met with resistance from the public when it was built, with many calling it an eyesore (Novelist Guy de Maupassant ate at a restaurant at the tower regularly, because it was the one place in Paris he was sure he wouldn't see it). Today, it is widely considered to be one of the most striking pieces of structural art in the world.\n\nOne of the great Hollywood movie clichés is that the view from a Parisian window always includes the tower. In reality, since zoning restrictions limit the height of most buildings in Paris to a few stories, only the very few taller buildings have a clear view of the tower.\n\nOriginally, Eiffel had a permit for the tower to stand for 20 years(when ownership of it would revert to the City of Paris, who had originally planned to tear it down; part of the original contest rules for designing a tower was that it could be easily torn down), more than recouping his expenses, but as it later proved valuable for communication purposes, it was allowed to remain after the expiry of the permit. The military used it to dispatch Parisian taxis to the front line of the Marne, and it therefore became a victory statue of that battle. It was also used to catch the infamous ""Mata Hari,"" and after this, its demolition became unthinkable to the French population."	Science & Mathematics

workmans comp settlements from a torn bi-cept? .  . It's not clear what you're asking, but you can have a workers compensation claim recognized for torn bicep if you establish the condition exists and it is related to your work activity.  Whether you settle your claim, and for what amount, depends on what benefits you may be entitled to receive in the state where you live.  In general, you should consider the cost of past and future medical care, lost wages, and any permanent partial impairment awards available.  You may also be entitled to vocational rehabilitation if you are physically unable to return to the type of work you were doing at the time of your injury.

Am I too young to buy a house? . I am 18 years old. Me and Fiance have a 1 year daughter. I work full time and He works 2 jobs, full and part time. My fiance think we are ready to buy a house. They are pretty cheap houses and they re nice looking. But I am only 18. Should we even be thinking about a house? . Yes, if you have an income, the earlier you invest in a house the sooner you can get it payed off.  Look for something inexpensive as a starter home.  Or even a town house. Just don't get something that is out of a reasonable price range. If you are married and have a child, you are better off investing in something like a house then paying someone rent.\n\nIt really depends on where you live as to what kind of houses are out there and how much they sell for.  I live in Oklahoma and bought a nice sized house for only $29k, the same house in South Carolina would go for over $100k and the same house in California would go for about $300k.  \n\nSo do some homework and be patient.  There are some good deals in your area I'm sure.  Good luck!	Family & Relationships

Are you going to be Moody again Today???? .  . Ok, well yesterday I had a reason to be moody!! I went to the dealership that advertised selling vehicles for as little as $5.00~figured it would be a gimmick. When I got there, there was a select number of different vehicles (in really great condition) that had the green balloons floating from them. The deal was if you were sitting in one of these vehicles at 10:00, you get the deal. Well, I have 3 kids and one more on the way, and 2 step-kids. Ya, a lot, I know, and that's why I was looking at a '03 Ford Windstar (ya, a mini-van) with 94,000 miles. Well, of course I had to bring my kids, so I invited my friend to come with so she could help watch them while I got my deal. 10 minutes to 10 she takes the older ones to get movies about a half a block away, leaving me with a kicking and screaming 2 year old. Ya, I went to find her to ask what's up with that? By the time I got back, the dealer putting a new sticker on the windows of unoccupied vehicles, the van was now $1200. I was pissed, knowing that I was 30 seconds too late for a much cheaper price. Still at $1200, it was a steal. About 25 minutes later I come back with the money, only to see the price is now 12,411. Seems the second deal was only good for half hour. So ya, I was moody yesterday, but I am hoping that today goes much better!! \n\nI hope YOU have a great day too!!	Family & Relationships

"Why is the ""heart""  referenced  in...............? . poetry, songs, plays, movies, stories, greeting cards, religion, love, the Bible, romance, carved on trees with initials, drawn by children in pre-school, kindergarten through college, when it is an organ of the body that pumps blood? . A long time ago, before people knew what the heart was really used for, it came to be associated with strong emotion.  Whenever you feel strong emotion, there's a sensation on the left side of the chest.  We now know that sensation is actually caused by chemicals in the brain.  Back then, people didn't know that.  They just assumed that the heart controlled emotion.  Even know we know better now, the old associations still stick with us, as they have become so ingrained in our culture."	Society & Culture

what is the difference between chemistry and chemical engineering? .  . Chemical engineering is the application of science, in particular chemistry, physics and mathematics, to the process of converting raw materials or chemicals into more useful or valuable forms.\n\nChemistry (derived from alchemy) is the science of matter at or near the atomic scale. In this pursuit chemistry deals with the properties of such matter, the transformations of matter and the interactions of matter with other matter and with energy. \n\nEXAMPLE: \n\nThe difference between chemical engineering and chemistry can be illustrated by considering the example of producing orange juice. A chemist working in the laboratory investigates and discovers a multitude of pathways to extract the juice of an orange. The simplest mechanism found is to cut the orange in half and squeeze the orange using a manual juicer. A more complicated approach found is to peel and then crush the orange and collect the juice. A company then commissions a chemical engineer to design a plant to manufacture several thousand tons of orange juice per year. The chemical engineer investigates all the available methods for making orange juice and evaluates them according to their economical viability. Even though the manual juicing method is simple, it is not economical to employ thousands of people to manually juice oranges. Thus another, cheaper method is used (possibly the 'peel and crush' technique). The easiest method of manufacture on a laboratory bench will not necessarily be the most economical method for a manufacturing plant.	Science & Mathematics

Can anyone help with copying dvd's? . Im trying to copy a dvd and then burn a copy onto a blank dvdr. I have downloaded a dvd decrypter, nero and dvd shrink but i cant get it to copy. the dvd plays fine in my dvd player and on my pc but when i copy it gets stuck at a certain bit and gives read errors. The disk looks clean and i dont see any deep scratches on it. does anyone know what i can do to fix this as its driving me mental lol . First start with DVD Decrypter, because if the disc gives you read errors at this point, it's probably either too scratched/scuffed to copy or has a new copy protection scheme.\n\nUsually, if a DVD movie works with DVD decryper and gives no read errors, you should be able to burn the disc without a hitch.\n\nIf the disc completes in DVD Decrypter, then open the files in DVD shrink and it should work.

Are carbon dioxide (Co2) lasers safe? How can I build a mini-Co2 lasre myself? (show me a schema)? .  . How safe they are depends on how powerful they are. They radiate in the infrared so the light isn't visible. \n\nYou'll need a tube with electrodes spaced apart a few feet with wires coming in. You'll need a high voltage source, maybe a transformer from a neon light hooked to the wires. \n\nYou'll need a vacuum pump and you'll need to pump the tube down to about 5 mm of pressure while you feed in a mixture of helium, neon and carbon dioxide. You'll have to look up the mixing ratio.\n\nYou'll need something to seal the end of the tube with. Ideally you'll have mirrors but more than likely the mirrors will be external. One will have to be reflective the other should half silvered and of a type that won't absorb the infrared light. Most glass will absorb the light and you won't get any output. Some plastics work and you can always put the mirrors outside the tube  (one with a pin-hole in it) and use Brewster angles (look it up) to seal the end of the tube... No glass on the seals; special plastics or sodium chloride plates work. \n\nThen you'll need an infrared detector; the light is invisible and a lot of patience aligning the mirrors.

Why do I close my eyes when I sneeze? . Why is it that everytime I sneeze I'm not able to keep my eyes open, even if I try ? . Closing your eyes is a natural reaction for several reasons: strong wind blasts and, of course, sneezing. It's mainly to keep your eyes protected from the resulting dust and mist. Your eyes will not pop out of your head, your actual sockets would hold them in! This is a myth. I don't know how it got started, but it's not true.	Health

she is 148 and she is 13 and her height is 5'3? . my little cuzin weighs 148 and she is 13 and her height is 5'4 i dont know what to tell her is she overweight . i agree with most other comments, she still is young and her body may change a lot (and for the batter) as she grows, however, i think you shold try to get her a little more active, like taking a walk, swimming, bike riding, or getting her to tr out for a sport, that way she can get some more exercise, possibly lose some wight, but still not put her at riskfor still being young.  also, try checking her diet, a little junkfood averyday can go a long way, so maybe try taking her out to healthier places for lunch or dinner, and make it a treat for both of you so you can both, (her especially) enjoy a healtier lifestyle.\n\nhope that offers some help!!!

"Do you feel......? . Hi friends,\n\n       I have a strange...(mmm what to say..?)...ok. ...I have a strange characteristic.....I can sense what is gonna happen in the future beforehand......for eg.....If something bad is gonna happen I can feel it in my mind, it makes me cry suddenly without any reason and something bad happens the very day...n' if something good is gonna happen I feel that too and it happens,,,,is it strange..should I consult any psycologist? Do any one of you feel like me....help me. . Before I start, I want to give you the link for a support group so you have a solid place to hear others opinions and ask anything you want about the problem you have. Here is the link: http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/psychic-ability/\n\nThere are 2 more sites for you. I am not psychic nor would I ever claim to be. I am not some weirdo who is into whitchcraft either. I am a 37 year old wife and stay-at-home mother of 3. I am however, a strong believer in the fact that some people just have abilities that I do not. I have watched, read, looked into this psychic thing. I also believe that for the most part, the psychic abilities can be ""channeled"" in a positive way. I have often read of people who have abilities as you said you do, learn how to turn that entire situation into good. You can learn to expand on the bad feelings you get and possibly get to a point where it doesn't just make you cry, you are able to see exactly what bad thing is going to happen and possibly stop it from happening. I see the psychic's all the time where they are called in by the police department to try and find missing people, solve crimes, many times solve murders. The psychic has to experience the pain that the murder victim went through but I don't know about you but I would do it every day of the week if I could help a family find their loved one, help solve a murder, help put a murderer or rapest behind bars so they can't hurt anyone else. Don't look at this as an all bad thing. I wish I had the ability because my main goal would be to help law enforcement as much as I could no matter how muh it hurt to do it. Look what the rewards would be...you could help keep a community safe and end the hell that a family of a victim had been in. I do have to also say BE CAREFUL THOUGH.... You can develop this so it's a good thing. There are scams all over though. Psychic's and people and web sites that claim to be able to ""help"" you develop your abilities are one of the highest scams out there. Read..READ...READ...I can't tell you what to do, I can only tell you what I would do. I would get books on the subject from my local library 1st. I would do all sorts of reading online but DO NOT PLEASE give anyone even a red cent online. Even on the sites I am sending you below...the second someone asks for any type of money be it membership fees, buy my book, donations for others who are also trying to sharpen their skills, or fees for them to teach you. After I read non-stop on the internet and from my library, I personally would look for free introductory or free session of any type in my local area (internet is a good place to find out about them). Then I would be looking to my local community college and take classes, as many classes as I could on the subject. That way, you are getting the knowledge at the rate YOU are comfortable with, if anything makes you uncomfortable at any time, you can just stop right in your tracks. Lastly, NOBODY IS RIPPING YOU OFF. It sounds to me as if you possibly could have abilities, you can direct them to where you want them, and not have such a negative effect coming from this but watch your back. For someone people, money is all that matters. They will claim they are wanted to help and teach but in reality, they have their hand in your pocket. I wish you the world of luck. I can be contacted via email by, I think just clicking on my log in name on yahoo ask /answer if you would like to. This is a subject that I have studied/read about for a few years now. If you have any questions that I can answer, feel free."	Health

Has president Bush, or his cohorts, suspended the right of habeas corpus? . I heard this has already been done by the homeland security bills or otherwise. it is now possible in the USA to get taken into custody with no charges or any report to the public and held forver without a trial or attorney. is this true? . Actually, Hamdi wasn't released. He was forcibly deported.\n\nAnd the Bush administration ignored the Hamdi ruling in the matter of Jose Padilla, who was held without charges for years until being charged with unrelated crimes a few months ago.\n\nThe Real ID Act in July 2005 changed the Habeas procedure in certain cases, including most immigration deportation cases, to eliminate Habeas review at the Federal District Court level, though Circuit Court of Appeals review is still available.\n\nFinally in December 2005, the Senate passed a bill [S. 1042] removing the rights of 'enemy combatants' to challenge their status in any federal courts, thus eliminating Habeas review. This is the infamous Graham amendment, and was publicly supported by the White House. \n\nIt was later merged into the appropriations bill, along with  Senator McCain's Anti-Torture provisions, which this bill largely bypasses. Bush signed the bill into law, along with the infamous signing statement where he claims presidential authority to ignore the laws prohibiting torture and fair treatment or prisoners whenever he sees fit.

why does water and other liquids exert upward thrust (boyancy)?? . why is the direction of the boyant force upwards???..........can u plz explain the archimidies principle . Pressure in fluid increases with the depth. The strange thing with pressure is that it works in every direction. So the water above 5 meters is pressing downwards on the water beneath the 5 meters and the water beneath the 5 meters is pressing upwards on the water above. Because it is the same depth the upward and downward pressure is the same. If we put an object into a fluid the fluid above the object is pushing it down, but the fluid beneath the object is pushing it up. Because we are talking about an object now and not some imaginary plane, there is a height difference (depth difference) between the fluid pushing down and the fluid pushing up, so the pressure differs, thus the forces differ. The upward force will be larger then the downward force. It depends on the weight of the object in relation to this forcedifference however if it sinks or floats.	Science & Mathematics

"The color of stars? . Stars are differnt colors depending on thier heat, can what the sun is made of also change the color of it? . The stars are different colours not only due to there size and mass, but due to an effect called the Doppler shift. Also remember what Einstein said, ""It is all relative to the observer"". A Red giant to us, would be a blue giant if viewed from a different angle elsewhere in the Universe. Now my question to you is, Where in the Universe would you have to be to see this Blue Giant? As to the colour temperature of the sun, take a Bunsen burner or propane burner that you find in any school lab class and play with the air fuel ratio and watch the colour of the flame change. If the ratio of gases that cause our sun to burn changes, it will effect the colour temperature in which it burns. Remember there is more to the universe than what the eye thinks it sees. I hope this answers your question."	Science & Mathematics

simplest proof of sir fermats last theorem? . please refer to the url www.in.answers.yahoo.com/\nquestion/?qid=20060608054\n655AAW70ig . The question now is not if we understand your proof. The question is, do u understand what u r doing actually?\n\nI didn't see your proof of N=a^2-b^2 for any number, but I take it as u have done it correctly becos this is true and is, in fact, very obvious. N=a^2-b^2=(a+b)(a-b)=c.d Any number can be expressed as product of other numbers, this is trivial. Even the nondivisible prime number can be expressed in such way by choosing a and b such that either a+b or a-b is 1.\n\nAs for your proof..\n\na^n = b^n + c^n\n\nu r trying to show ALL numbers can ONLY be written in a^n - b^n when n=2, and not n>2. Since c^n is included in ALL number, hence, there is no a^n = b^n + c^n for n>2.\n\nU started out by stating n=2. a^2-b^2. You then factor this to become (a+b)(a-b), then u restate a and b in term of x, e and d.... a=x+e, b=x+d. you then substitute a and b with x+e and x+d. Then, u found for the product to be equal N, given one side is a+b, the other side must be a-b.... and hence u get back a^2-b^2. Then u conclude, n must be 2 and nothing else.\n\nThe problem is.... u r essentially doing nothing here except, stating a^2-b^2... write in in another form(factor form).... write a and b in another form(x,e,d).... then u do everything in reverse again by turning (x,e,d) back into a and b.... turn factor form into a^2-b^2 form again. see. u r not doing anything at all except taking a u-turn and come back again.\n\nwhen a-b=d, now matter how fancifully u express a and b, their difference is still d.\n\nSo, u dont have to repeat your proof here again and again.

"can anyone tell me a little bit about aquarius people. the truth? .  . well, im dont know wether ur a guy@gal..so,i just give u overall description bout both aquarius guy n gal!!\n\n\nAQUARIUS MAN \n\nHot-hearted man who likes to do thing  his way. He can suddenly decide to do something without thinking of it's  outcome. He is the type of guy with an inside energizer, so if you fall in  love with this type of guy be ""patient"", even if you have to follow him a  bit. His creative mind could create fantastic idea any time. If you do not  understand or can not follow him, you won't be with him for long. \n\nA  man in this Zodiac will less likely to have a pale skin, and if he has a scar, it would be on his face or on his head. He moves very fast and very energetic, and he has a very self confident in himself. He is not the type to sit down and feel sorry or regret anything for long, especially with ""Love"". He loves justice. He dares to show his opinion or even argue about certain subject even he knows it might bring him problems. A straight forward type of guy. He hardly lies except if he think it is  necessary and he is not a good liar anyway. He will not lie to you about  serious matter, but if he lie he will lie only a small little thing. He is  gifted with the ability to be a very social person. He could talk even about  subject that he has no knowledge of. He interests only at the present time  and look at the world positively. Many times he feels hurt because of  reality, but he will not run away and he will overcome that  difficulty. \n\nEven he is a high and self confident type and center his own   thought as a main focus, but at the same time he is a kind, cute and polite guy. He certainly is not a mean person. He likes to help people who are in troubles even he is not asked to. He is the type who feels sorry if you remember bad things he said to you that he had already forgotten,but you did not. Belief him that he is very sorry and give him another chance. Once he decides to do something, he will put all his mind and energy in it either in his ""Work"", or ""Love"". He is the type who gamble anything in the casino, so do not even take him there. He does not like pessimistic, low energy, and depress person, especially no brain. Strangely he like to overpowered this type of people to assure that he is more superior. \n\nHe like to be the first person to do something. You can see   sparkling in his eyes, once he meet a new target or new lover. Once he is in love, he will act as if he never has love like this before. This minute he could be real sugar sweet, and later he could also be an icy cold, but do not blame him for that will only chase him away. He could fall in love again with another girl and act again like he never has this kind of love before.He could really love someone, but not a heart broken type for he  thinks love is ""excitement"" and ""Love goes on"". If you date this kind of guy, do not or avoid showing your face to him with face pack, face mask, always be presentable, nice and cute. If he is quiet not because he is shy, but he is only quietly thinking. If you have a chance to ask his  X-girlfriend, she will tell you that he is not a shy or quiet type. If he is  really and truly in love with you, he will never lie to you at all. How do  you know if he loves you, bet on your faith! Love him and treat him steadily and do not try to find anything to argue with him, he will be with you for sure. \n\nIf you are his lover or girlfriend and need to tell him something,  go and say it out loud and straight forward because he hate long boring  story. He hate to play games, chasing for love or being chased, so let him  call you first. He likes a confident woman who also a good follower. If he gets mad at you, let him be for only a short time he will be normal again. You have to like and be able to get along with his friends, but he does not  have to do so with all your friends. \n\nDon't ever think you could make  him jealo"	Entertainment & Music

"Where did the phrase ""ok"" come from? .  . The history of the abbreviation OK is not what you'd expect. Some think that it comes from the Chocktaw affirmative okeh, or the Greek olla kalla, or others. The truth is that in the 1830's in New England, initialisms were the fad. Much like TGIF and FYI in modern times, in fact. The craze even went into generating letter combinations of intentional misspellings. Popular ones were ""K.G."" for ""know go"", ""K.Y."" for ""know use"", and ""O.W."" for ""oll write"". ""O.K."" naturally followed, standing for ""oll korrect"". O.K. is the only one that survived through the years. It's because of Martin Van Buren, elected our eighth president in 1836. He was born in Kinderhook, New York. Early in his political career, he was nicknamed ""Old Kinderhook"", which echoed the Oll Korrect initialism. OK became the rallying cry of the Old Kinderhook Club, a political organization supporting Van Buren during the 1840 campaign. The initials stuck as what H. L. Mencken described as ""the most shining and sucessful Americanism ever invented""."	Education & Reference

"What does ""AS IS"" mean in Real Estate? . Hello, I have recently started house hunting. I found a place online I would like to look at but I noticed it said this home is ""AS IS"" does that mean that there is a problem with the home that the seller is aware of but does not want to fix? Thanks! . ""As is"" means don't ask the seller to make improvements.  For example, a normal house for sale may have old worn carpet.  The buyer can negotiate the seller to replace the carpet OR give the buyer a credit for the price of replacing the carpet.  In normal house sales, negotiations like this take place all the time.\n\nWith an ""as is"" property, the seller is full aware of the things wrong with the house and they do not intend to fix them.  They can be minor things like worn carpet or old paint, but they can also be major things like an old roof or substandard plumbing.  They don't want you to go into the offer expecting to negotiate.  Does that make sense?"	Business & Finance

Should I ground my son for? . My son is 16 and very intelligent. He has scored in the top 5% of kids his age nationally on standardized testing. Yet he has a D for the fourth quarter in Geometry and holds a C for the year as of now. He also has A's in English, Chemistry, and a B in History. I have been telling him since half way through this marking period to pull up that grade and go for extra help. He doesn't always do his homework or study. He didn't go for any help even though the teacher offered. I told him at that time if he ended the quarter with a D he would be grounded for the first 3 weeks of summer.(working around the house, not going out) Even though he got good grades in his other classes and still will end the year with a C in geometry should he be grounded, if so for how long? . nah, don't ground him. i think it isn't even the case that he lacks doing his homework, or that he studies too less.\n\ni had the same problem in school, intelligent student, on every course i had high grades. only biology i could never get into my head. i doesn't interest me at all how flowers reproduce, my brain simply refused to keep that information.\n\nand i saw it a lot around me, intelligent people who are very good at a lot of things, always have a few things that they can't get their mind to do, no matter how much they even want to.\n\nin my country holland, we grade from 1 to 10, with 10 being the highest. on almost all my classes i scored 8 or 9 or 10. Biology was always a 3 or even lower. No matter how hard i tried. \n\nAt the age of 16, i actually think it's a very good thing that your son chooses the things that obviously interest him the most.

"Why is it I only get fake phone numbers from American women? . I lived in Europe for several years, Naples Italy. And I currently live in Thailand. I have never got a fake phone # outside of the States. Don't give me any crap about girls wanting to go to America, my Thai girlfriend makes more money than I do. Why do American women give fake #s? Are they too weak and fragile to simply say they are not interested? Do they do it just to be nasty? Do they think it's funny? . It probably has to do with your approach toward women.  American women are smart, and can tell when you are being insincere or if you are just ""wanting"" something from them.  Be too foreward, and you'll get a fake number every time."	Society & Culture

why is real maldrid not not top of it league even though they have all the world best player? . you can agree with me also that even thought most of the world best player are all in real maldrid are are not doing well as bacelona.is it too much good player or what. . Football is a team game. Its need 100% team-effort to win a vital match. It is true that the world best players are playing for Real Madrid, but maximum of them are aged. They are now not as good as they had before four years. So the efficency of team is quite low than other renowned team like Barcilona, Villareal, Real Jaragoja, AC & Inter Milan, Juventas, Chelsea, Arsenal, Liverpool, Man United, Benfica etc. Not only that, the ego problem is also ruin the team efforts of Real Madrid. The coach is unable to control those super stars. The Real Madrid Management have change their coach several times in recent past. I hope they will overcoma this problem and contract with some young star footballer like Henri, C. Ronaldo, Ronaldinho, Kaka, Mesi, Balack, etc. in future.	Sports
Can anybody recommend a good UK university for doing a degree in eng.lit, history or art? . Im looking at potential universities and colleges at the moment and i'm wondering if anyone can recommend a good one in the UK (preferably england) for studying english lit, history, history of art or fine art?? I'm looking for a good quality university with a good reputation but also a good cultural scene - galleries, exhibitions and live bands, also a good nightlife. Any suggestions? I'm particularly interested in going to somewhere around London or one of the other bigger cities. . I would recommend London. It is the capital city of England, and it is well known all over the world.\n\nI went to Goldsmiths College, University of London. It has a great atmosphere and whole range of arts subjects to choose from. The actual area of the uni is not the most salubrious - but has the advantage of cheaper accommodation. It is about 15 minutes or less by train to London Bridge and Charing Cross. Central London)\n\nThe are other universities which are in the city and might suit you better if money is not a problem and you like to be close to all the galleries and nightlife.\n\nManchester University also has a good name for English Lit. Oxford and Cambridge are the cream. All university cities are good for cultural and night life - but London gets my vote.\n\nGood luck!	Education & Reference

Is the financial investment worth the risk? . I have an idea for a product and have gone to Davidson Inc. with my idea and they have sent me a contract outlining what they will do with my idea.  They will research it, find companies who may license it, then put together a portifolio, and let me decide if I want them to create a prototype for actual presentation. The catch is, it's about $700 for the research and portfolio, then potentially up to 15K for creation of a prototype with which to take to companies for them to consider. I think my idea is a good one, I know of nothing like it on the market, and I believe in it's marketability. (esp. compared to some of the crap out there in stores) What I want to know is if any one has experience with this company, and feedback. Does anyone know of the cheapest way to promote an idea or product. I can't make one. I could draw a picture with a written description. I was advised to not get a patent right away, as the product itself may require revision. . Unless you have the knowledge or resources to make a prototype yourself, your going to need a company to help you. However like the previous poster said if they are the ones that advised you not to get a patent then i'd be very wary. There are reputable companies that do deal in this but I couldn't tell you who. You could go with the private investors but again unless you can make it, or know someone who can what good will that money do?	Business & Finance

"Catholic joke? . All that are religious, plz don't take this the wrong way:\n\nThere's these two kids that go to sunday school, one of which who keeps falling asleep in class is sitting next to a retard. The teacher asks, ""Who created heaven and earth?"" the retard stabs the girl with his pencil. ""God almighty!"" yells the girl. ""Very good!"" says the teacher. The girl starts to snooze off again, the teacher asks, ""Who died for our sins?"" the boy stabs her with his pencil again, ""Jesus Christ!"" yelled the girl. ""Very good."" The girl goes off to sleep again, and the teacher asks, ""What did Eve say to Adam after having their 26th kid?"" the boy jabs her with the pencil again, and the girl yells, ""If you jab that thing into me one more time, I swear I'll break it off!"" . Alright, let's revise this joke so we can relieve the good old laugh:\n\nLittle April was not the best student in Sunday school. \nUsually she slept through the class. \n\nOne day the teacher called on her while she was napping, ""Tell me, April, who created the universe?"" \n\nWhen April didn't stir, little Johnny, a boy seated in the chair behind her, took a pin and jabbed her in the rear. ""GOD ALMIGHTY!"" shouted April and the teacher said, ""Very good"" and April fell back asleep. \n\nA while later the teacher asked April, ""Who is our Lord and Saviour,"" But, April didn't even stir from her slumber. Once again, Johnny came to the rescue and stuck her again. 'JESUS CHRIST!"" shouted April and the teacher said, ""very good,"" and April fell back to sleep. \n\nThen the teacher asked April a third question. ""What did Eve say to Adam after she had her twenty-third child?"" And again, Johnny jabbed her with the pin. This time April jumped up and shouted, ""IF YOU STICK THAT F*****G THING IN ME ONE MORE TIME, I'LL BREAK IT IN HALF AND STICK IT UP YOUR A$$!"""	Entertainment & Music
Why do people tend to only give to the homeless around Thanksgiving or Christmas? . Not saying it's wrong, because giving is still giving. It just seems that no one is interested in giving during spring or summer...why do you think that is? . Because attention is not paid to during the year. Out of sight out of mind people tend to focus on less fortunate people when it is convenient for them but that does undermine the fact that they are homeless during the whole entire year not only during the holidays.

"How many deitied exist in the Hindu religion, and why do many Hindu's claim that they are in fact monotheist? .  . Just because the Hindu religion has many dieties does not mean that a Hindu worships all of them. Some of them just focus only on one.\n\nWhen one focuses on too many dieties in their worship to aide their spiritual growth, that is spreading energies too thin and not creating much of a progress.\n\nAmma told a story of this devotee that when he went to go see a guru. This guru worshiped so many different dieties. This devotee started digging a hole when the guru worshiped a diety. Then when the guru would go to the next diety and pray to that one, and the devotee would stop digging the hole and move to dig another new hole. The devotee kept digging so many small holes for all of the different dieties. I don't have the exact wording of this story but the concept is that this devotee wasn't able to successfuly dig one deep hole.\n\nBy focusing on one diety, one can really seriously feel their energies more. Also just because one focuses on one diety does not mean they wouldn't partake in many of the cultural festivals that celebrate other dieties. That would be more of a holiday, cultural aspect rather than actually worshiping it on a daily basis.\n\nWhat Hindu is in ""general"" as a religion does not always mean that it is the same for a specific person."

Why can't bi-polar patients get medication implants? . A friend of ours is bi-polar. He's a fantastic person, talented and creative and dedicated.

"Are ouija boards real? Do you have any stories about when you used one?? .  . It is not evil - it's merely a board with some black letters and a planchette\n\nIf you go looking for evil or demons you might possibly get something unwanted such as that - I've heard of stories of people trying to invoke demons and the like - they suddenly find members of their family having tragic accidents and suddenly developing terminal diseases with no ill effect to themselves - don't do it - it's not worth trying - otherwise be prepared to deal with what you bring on!\n\nSpirits that talk through the board are just like you and me - they deserve respect and should be treated well\n\nNothing will come from a board if you leave it lying around - you do not need to burn it or throw it away if you have a bad experience - it cannot work without people making it work\n\nALWAYS include prayers amongst the circle of people involved in the seance to both OPEN and close the circle. It is a good idea to make sure you protect yourself before the seance is begun with a few prayers..\n\nNever let anyone be involved in a seance who is under the influence of drugs or alcohol\n\nTiredness will stop the board from working properly - make sure all members of the seance are fully awake and not overly tired.\n\nNon believers and overly skeptical people will also ruin a seance, it's a good idea to approach a board with an open mind and a willingness to accept whatever comes forth.\n\nDon't all start arguing about who's moving the planchette - this is a common thing - it upsets the mood and some people get very angry and ruin the entire thing. If you feel that someone is pushing the planchette ask them to remove their hands for a short time.\n\nDON'T ASK THE SPIRITS TO PROVE THEY ARE THERE - Just think about it for a while - if you ask them to prove that they are there OF COURSE something is going to happen - whether it be rattling cupboards or windows - temperature dropping - things being thrown across the room - movement of other objects - you asked them to prove they are there and they are just showing you that they are.....they can't simply send you a letter in the mail saying ""hey - by the way - I was there the other night and this is just to prove it"".\nALSO it is strongly believed that if you do ask a spirit to prove that it is there that you are opening up a doorway to the other side, one that is very hard to close, you are inviting unwanted guests into this world that you may not be able to send home. Once they are here they are almost impossible to get rid of and you might find you have something attched to you and following you around causing trouble for life.\n\nYOU ARE NOT BRINING SPIRITS INTO THIS WORLD BY MERELY TALKING TO THEM THROUGH A BOARD - As stated above, you may bring them back into this world by inviting them in (this is not my personal belief) so be careful - don't invite anything in. But just by using a board and talking to spirits you aren't going to pull them into this world and trap them here or anything. The Ouija board is merely a tool to talk to spirits who are all ready here and this does not create some kind of votex to trap and pull spirits back into our own world.\n\n\nHow Does it Work?\nThere are many many theories as to why and how a board works. Psychologists explain it as a simple muscle reflex that makes your hand automatically move and your subconscious mind control the words that are spelled out. Who knows maybe this is so. I know that I've seen unexplainable things which cannot simply be muscles and subconscious minds controlling the planchette. On many occasions I have seen a planchette move around the board on it's own, with no fingers touching it. I have seen dead relatives that people didn't even know they had step forward time and time again, the relative operating the board would look into their family history to find that this person really did exist. So what is it that makes it go, the truth is nobody really knows the answer"	Society & Culture

can a dental infection cause vertigo , blurred vision and balance problems? .  . It certainly can, but there would normally be other problems as well.   Vertigo and ballance problems can be caused by infections near the vestibular section of the vestibulococlear nerve (cranial nerve 8), that passes through the internal acoustic meatus, which is connected to the teeth because the teeth get sensory innervation from branches of the facial nerve, which also passes through the internal acoustic meatus.  Blurred vision would be a little harder to explain, I'd bet the optic nerve is not being impinged upon, but perhaps the infection is causing pressure inside the orbit and blurring the vision.  I hope you are at the very least on an antibiotic.  This isn't really all that likely to have happened, and it would be a little easier to believe if you also had ringing ears and painful, puffy eyes.  Perhaps the dental infection and the other symptoms are unrelated, but either way they need to be treated.	Health

Are Pagans serious about their religion? . To Pagans, do you really, truly believe in your religion? What type of family did you come from? I thought Paganism was destroyed when Christianity came to Europe. Is this true? If it is, how did it make its comeback? . I am very serious about my religion. I actively participate in worship every day and I try to live my life according to Pagan family values and morality and I teach my children to do so as well. I am an active part of the Pagan community and I volunteer and donate as often as I am able. I make purchases and develop habits that allow me to walk softly on the Earth, minimizing pollution, etc. I only eat natural food and I stay away from all addictive substances, because my body is a sacred vessel. Every morning I get up and greet the Goddess of Dawn and thank Her for a new day. Every time I sit down to eat, I thank the Earth for providing for me, and I thank my ancestors for setting into motion the processes that brought my food to the grocery store so I don't have to bust my hump to get it lilke they did. Every night before I go to bed, I look up at the moon (assuming there is one) and tell Her all of the things that happened that day that I am grateful for. Every full moon, I gather with my friends to worship, and every new moon we gather to journey. Every solstice and equinox and on the cross-quarter days we gather for a BIG feast and bring offerings for our Gods and have special rituals. Very serious.\n\nPaganism can't be destroyed. Paganism is just a name for something that didn't have a name before Christianity came and became it's opposite, thus requiring us to name it. There are Pagans all over the world and have been since the dawn of humankind. Some of them, though unfortunately fewer all the time, have never heard of Christianity.\n\nPaganism is Natural, this is why it can't be destroyed. It's inherent. Left to our own devices, we'd all be Pagan. When you look around at Nature, really look at it, you are awed and know it is holy. You know that there can't be just what you see, because it's just so wonderful, and you know that there can't be just one type of deity, or spirit because there are so many different types of humans and living things. Paganism also doesn't require that you reject other Gods, either. That's why Christianity was easily accepted, but it didn't mean that Paganism disappeared. It just meant that Christianity was incorporated into it. All we're doing now is purifying our faith, as the Christians have done, purging the Pagan elements, we are purging the Christian elements. And we claimed for ourselves a name.	Society & Culture

"Reasons for going to war?????? . Please help me. My class is having a debate!!!!!. 10 points for the deepest and best answer!!!! . The reason stated by the President was to remove the threat of weapons of mass destruction from Iraq. The Administration publicly and repeal stated that there was proof of WMD, and that it was the duty of the United States to remove this threat before it was put to use. A statement was made at the U.N. by the Bush administration that ""we don't want the proof to be in the form of a mushroom cloud"". That was referring to the theory that Iraq not only had weapons of mass destruction, but was also pursuing a nuclear program.\n\nNo weapons of mass destruction were found by the UN weapons inspectors in the years between the Gulf War and this invasion. There were WMD that were destroyed immediately after the Gulf War in 1991, and verified by the UN weapons inspection teams.\n\nIn addition to this, there was a unified Republican attempt to try to link Saddam Hussein to Bin Laden, 9/11 and Al Queda. This all proved to be baseless.\n\nNo weapons of mass destruction have been found since the invasion. This means that the reason for going to war was based on faulty intelligence to put it in the best light."	Politics & Government

Do you think pool is a racist's game and who came up with what ball should be what color? . My friend and I were thinking today, (yes it hurt a little) Why is the white ball the dominate ball?  It is the one that hits all the other balls in to the pockets, and why is the black ball last?  We thought the man who made the game was racist.  Only for the simple reason that the white ball seems to dominate the black ball.  the white call hits the black ball in, the whit call hits the strip balls in, the white ball hits the solid color balls in the pockets.... why cant the 8 ball be blue or green?  When does it have to be the white ball hitting the other balls around?  Why cant this change?  I love pool.  However, it just came to me that this is a racist’s game. Do U think it is? . Yes of course it's a racists game, BUT NOT THE ACTUAL GAME OR BALL COLORS..Hell I abuse who ever I'm playing to the max, even if it entails being a lil racist ,,,,BUT Hell it's only in fun cos cop the same from opponent, That's life WHO ISN'T RACIST these days HUH?\nBut not game itself,that's being plain stupid to the max...Cheers Bro...

How am I suppose to.....? . M'kay I REALLY wanna know how to make my thighs smaller and my calves! I wear....a size 11 in teans jeans and I want my legs to be smaller! So PLEASE HELP! Should I...stretch and go for a run?\n\nAlso:\n\n           How many crunches should I do to make my stomach flat? Right now I'm able to do 30 crunches without stopping and then I switch to pushups which I can do 20. Then I repeat this 5 tmes. Should I contunue to do this also? . For your legs:  biking, jogging, elliptical trainer, squats, dancing, kicking, stair climbing though not TOO much as you don't want bulging muscles.  They should just become firmer with all that exercise.\n\nFor your stomach:  Continue with the crunches but when you come up, turn to one side then down, then come up and turn to the other side. That will help develop your 'oblique' muscles in your abdominal section.\n\n Also, while you're on the floor, lift your head, put your hands behind your neck and lift your legs with your knees bent.  Now move your legs like you're pedalling a bike and alternate pointing your right elbow to your left knee when it's up, then your left elbow to your right knee.  \n\nKeep up the good work with the pushups but remember that your arms have other muscles so lift heavy objects and pull too.

Pet Store design??? . If you could have the power to design your own pet store, how would you do it????  What would you name your pet store?? How would you advertise it???  What kinds of animals would you have in it?  What would it look like on the inside and the outside???  Colors?? What colors turn you on in a pet store???  Please tell me in detail!!! I want to close my eyes and see the store!!! Thanks!! . WOW I get to be creative WOO HOO! I would have all the toys closer to the front for both cats and dogs and of course have the toys clearly marked and divided. THEN I would have an aisle with nothing but fish aquariums and fishy stuff like the tunnels and the rocks and the food. Then on the other side of the fishy shelves I would have the stuff for the reptiles the aquariums the toys and food that you would have for the reptiles. The next aisle I would have birdy cages and birdy toys and on the other side of the shelf stock the birdy food and birdy treats. OF course have your departments clearly marked with a brightly colored sign with the name of the animal that the department is for and have a nice picture of that kind of animal on the sign all different breeds. Okay now next to the birdy stuff, you have stuff for the rodents, the bunnies and the mice and gerbils and one side you have the cages and accessories and the next side you have their food. \n\nNow for the kittycats.  One side you have their pillows and beds and their accessories such as collars and the next side, you will have the food and their litterboxes and the same with the doggies and on each endcap, you should have magazines and books about each animal. NOW if you want to have stuff for barnyard animals that should be a whole separate department. You should have that in the back of the store, it should be designed like the gardening dept at places like walmart target and so on. The reason I say that is I automatically associate that with outdoors and barnyard animals as a rule are outdoor pets. There you would have the feeding tubs and so on and so forth, their food their hay. \n\nOh Yes and the inside of the store. Divide your store in two by putting a kitty and doggy treat thing in the middle where you can sell kitty and doggy cookies bulk. It looks just like our bulk food. \n\nMost pet stores consist of happy colors. Red and blue are good colors. THe blue will mellow out the red and yellow adds a happy tone to it, but you don't want to use too much red or too much yellow. You want to even everything out. \n\nThe name of your store should be: Paws and Claws Pet Supply.  IT should be called Happy Tails Pet Supply\n\nYou can advertise with those lil mail flyers to start with and offer various promos such as buy any bag of cat/dog food and get any size free or something like that. \nOffer free pet toys on the first visit\nOf course if it is not too expensive, get your own little newspaper going and put it in the Sunday papers you know liek petsmart has their own. \n\nOh Yes and the thing that people eat up is when they are allowed to take their pets shopping with them and around Christmas time Santa gets to come into the store so the pets can visit him. \n\nGunther helped me out with this.

Was I wrong to divorce my husband for being addicted to porn? . I spent 11 years of my life with a man addicted to porn.

perfectionism or right-fully upset? . I got a B in Enhanced Differential Equations, an honors class at Uconn. I graduated a year early with a 4.0 and had always done everything perfectly and had never really been faced with anything that I just couldn't do. I invented integration techniques back in Calculus 1. So I got to college by the age of 17 and I took Enhanced Differential Equations. I put my sweat, blood, and tears into getting an A in that class, but I just couldn't do it. It left me with a gigantic B-shaped crater in my self esteem, a B, a mocking visualization of my complete and utter failure despite rediculus (not exagerated) effort. I haven't gotten a B since I was 13 and at a school I didn't think was good enough for me none the less (I can't afford much else, but I could have done better). It wouldn't have been so bad if I had slacked and gotten a B but I put my life into that class, going to often rediculus lengths of studying but my effort got me no where. Am I crazy, or do I have a right to be upset? . You are not crazy yet, but if you keep thinking that you have to be perfect one day you will be crazy. Perfection is for God and you are not. Just look at it like this. You did everything you could but it didn't happend the way you wanted, but at least you got the chance to try. Do you know how many doesn't even get the chance or have the intelligence to do or acheive what you have? Besides a grade is one moments classification. You have your whole life to prove that you are better than that B if that is your concern. It would feel better not to think that you are perfect but that you are human and that as one it is more probable that you will make a mistake at one point in life. Some will be worst than others but they are all mistakes. But if we put our trust in The One who is perfect we will be blessed with His perfection and kindness. So for the next time instead of putting your faith in yourself and your efforts just put it in God and you will see and experience His perfection in what you do. God Bless.	Education & Reference

"How to improve the digestive power, so we don't have flatulence? . Please don't say Beano!\nI am trying to control flatulence. There should be a way to control it instead of Beano or Gas-X some other similar items... . Excessive flatulence is a sign of a food allergy/intollerance. The most common food allergies are caused by Dairy, Wheat flour and most other refined flours. (corn flour is usually safe, so is potato) Excessive fiber can cause such disturbances, however most people don't eat ENOUGH fiber, so that's unlikely to be the issue unless you happen to eat A LOT of it all the time. Beans are famous for their gaseous effects..but to be honest, I don't think beans are a real ""gasser"" for most people unless you happen to have a food allergy with beans. Cut the wheat, flour, and dairy from your diet for 3 days- I can almost guarrantee your flatulence will be diminished. I fart only about once a day! LOL Seriously, my diet is extremlely healthy and happens to be high in fiber (but not TOO high) instead of bread I eat brown rice, sweet potatoes, ect. Tortilla chips & anything made out of corn flour doesn't seem to bother me one bit. I also noticed a reduction in acne when I started doing this. Try it and see!

is it cheaper to get a loan through a mortgage broker or directly through a bank? And what's the difference? .  . The more info you have the better.  If you use a mortgage broker they are going to search their base of investors, whether they are using big money like Washington mutual or some other lending sources or private money.  You don't want to have every mortgage broker run your credit because the more hits you get asking for your rating the more your rating can be affected. The best thing to do is check your rating yourself and then present your info to the broker and ask him to give you a good faith estimate.  There are many things to watch for when doing these transactions so do your homework and take no shortcuts.  The lender, whether it be the bank or investors, is going to look at 1.  Your income, through check stubs with year to date info\n2.  Your credit rating, 680 or higher is pretty good\n3.  Your current profession and how long you've been in it, or on the current job.\nAnd maybe some other things also.  I just got done with a loan package so somethings are still fresh in my memory.  Make sure you get the info from a broker or a banker and then study the papers ask questions and don't go to every mortgage broker in town having them run your credit.

Is there serious money to be made in penny stocks, and if so how? . Also, is there any scams to watch out for?   Thanks . There can be serious money to be made if you research everything carefully (remember, some of the biggest names on the stockmarket were penny stocks at one point).... however there can also be serious money LOST too.\n\nHere's a typical example of how it COULD work if your lucky, using my Halifax Sharedealer trading account + the shares in my ISP as an example:\nPipex Communications (PXC.L) - I stuck £5 on them in April 2005 when they were valued @ 7.75pence\nWith sharebuilder, that was £3.48 worth of shares, and £1.52 in commission & Stamp Duty. It bagged me 44.897433 shares in them.\n\nNow, imagine you hold onto them shares for bloody ages, so they rise in value to say 50pence a share.\n\n£0.50 x 44.897433 = £22.45 (or £22.4487165 if you don't round that figure up).\n\nThen of course with Penny stocks they don't usually pay out any dividend...... but imagine how much you can earn with that many shares picked up on the cheap once they've matured enough to pay a dividend to re-invest.\n\nLet's say 10pence a share (just to make it easy to work out)\n£0.10 x 44.897433 shares = £4.49 (practically a refund of your initial investment).\n\nBut you've also gotta remember that as there's so many of them for your money... and you've put a fair bit of money on them (and got bloody loads of shares in them as a result), if they go down in value on you, they can give your portfolio's value a right good kicking... so are as risky as trying to get a bj off an Alligator with toothache.

Marriage has always been defined as the union between one man and one woman.  Homosexuals who love each other want the same status and standing as heterosexuals.  One of the chief concerns is, if we change the definition of marriage to include same sex couples, then it will also be expanded to include other unions such as:  multiple partners, adults and children, adults and animals, and whatever can be imagined by human beings.  \n\nIt has been suggested that same sex couples be provided the same rights that marriage allows, but it is most often stated in the media that same sex couples not only want the same rights, they want the same standing or respect.  They too want to be called ""married"".  \n\nMany heterosexual couples are troubled by this demand because they believe marriage is a sacred trust and gift from God. They believe that marriage was instituted by God in Genesis and that God will return for his spiritual Bride in Revelation 21.  Those who are opposed to homosexual marriage would state that marriage was created by God to support the family; one man, one woman and children.  They would also state that the heterosexual family is and has been the foundation of society and culture for thousands of years.  \n\nThere are of couse exceptions in history and even presently.  There is also currently a high divorce rate but married heterosexuals would argue that failure in marriage does not justify changing the definition of what marriage is....one man and one woman.  Society often makes moral changes without considering the consequences or justifying the decision by stating what is wrong with the present model.  Abortion started this way, with the declaration that women's lives were in danger and women were killing themselves by attempting abortions at home or in back alleys under the care of unscrupulous doctors.  Abortion has now become a form of birth control with well over one million babies aborted yearly in the U.S. alone.  \n\nMany heterosexual couples see the changing of marriage to include same sex couples as fallling further and further away from what is healthy for society and farther down the road toward a loss of morality and moral standards.  They do not want marriage, which they consider sacred, changed to include other unions.  They would prefer,if same sex couples are permitted to be ""married""  that same sex couples be granted the same rights but not the same name.  A different name such as ""union"" or the invention of a completely new word."	Family & Relationships

"Why is the Montgomery G.I Bill misleading? . In my case the GI BILL promised me $20,000 for school. So how come they dont just pay up front the $14,000 that it will take me to go to school? Why do I have to pay out of my pocket? and then they repay me? Also I'm going to a trade school that the VA only considers 3/4 time. So they will only pay me $775 a month. That is not even half of the tuition cost in an 8 month period? Why did I serve my country being promised this money for college and I'm having to pull student loans to pay for my college?? . Those are the games the government plays when you're getting ""free"" money.  I know, I know.  You worked for it.  Well, this way you have to work to get what they promised and more than likely they won't have to pay out the full amount they promised.\n\nPlus there's no guarantee that the program will last the whole time it takes for you to get everything promised to you.  If congress decides they want to cut the benefits to save money, they can and will do that too.  So don't waste too much time getting what is owed to you.\n\nJust like everywhere else in life, you have to read the fine print.\n\nThe one time I got a nice chunk o' money from them was when they were short in my career field my first reinlistment and they offered me a nice bonus not to get out.

"Which member of the Ubuntu Linux family would be best for me? . I'm an average user who is interested in switching to a Linux distro from Windows XP at some point in the near future.  I've used Windows OS's pretty exclusively since about 1993, and I've heard that all of the Ubuntu distros are very good for Linux noobs. I am concerned about system resource usage, but I also want something that looks and feels similar to what I'm accustomed to.  Is there a significant difference between the look and feel of Xubuntu, Kubuntu, and Ubuntu?  I've already ruled out Edubuntu since I don't need a lot of those software packages. . I would personally recommend the basic (GNOME) Ubuntu. It is IMO, the simplest and easiest to use. Also, since more people use it, you get better community support. If this is your first Linux, then go for GNOME, since KDE is a little more advanced and complicated.\n\nXubuntu uses Xfce instead of GNOME or KDE. Xfce is made to be a sort of ""light GNOME"". I've never actually used it, but I really recommend it if your PC has less than 256 mb of RAM.\n\nAlso, be aware that each Desktop Environment and Ubuntu flavour comes with a different set of applications. For example, if I remember correctly, Ubuntu comes with OpenOffice.org, Kubuntu with Koffice, and Xubuntu with GNOME-office (Abiword and Gnumeric). Xubuntu and Ubuntu come with Firefox, Kubuntu comes with Konqueror. And so on."	Computers & Internet
How can I tell her that I don't want to be close friends anymore? . I admit, this sounds kind of mean, but I have to ask. It's driving me crazy. I've been friends with this girl since fifth grade, and we used to be such good friends. But she has become kind of demanding and sulky over the years, and it's kind of like she depends on me for her happiness. Her attitude been getting a liiiiittle bit better, but not as much as I would like, because I feel really annoyed whenever I'm around her, even if she doesn't do anything wrong at the moment. This is being super mean, I know, especially because I hardly look at her whenever I talk or listen to her. And when she calls me I always get super exasperated, even when it's about homework. How should I tell her (in a mature way) to stop hanging around with me so much? I've already tried once recently, but it doesn't seem like it worked. Or should I just suck it up and be her friend, even if it drives me crazy? Any other suggestions? Thanks! . 	Family & Relationships

"How did noah get all those animals on his ark? .  . The answer is found in Genesis as to how it was done:\n\nGenesis 6:19-22\n\nAnd of every living thing of all flesh,two of every sort shalt thou bring into the ark,to keep them alive with thee;\nthey shall be male and female.Of fowls after their kind,\nand of cattle after their kind, of every creeping thing of the earth after his kind,two of every sort shall come unto thee, to keep them alive.\nAnd take thou unto thee of all food that is eaten,     and thou shalt gather it to thee;and it shall be for food for thee, and for them. Thus did Noah; according to all that God commanded him,so did he.\n\nThe key phrase being: two of every sort shall come unto thee - meaning the animals where led to Noah by God. \n\nCome to consider it, the animals knew of the flood by their senses (even today animals know of impending danger even before it happens) and the animals moved to higher ground of which the ark was located.\n\nFurthermore:\n\nAlthough we do not know the exact length of a cubit at this time (verse 15), later, it was about 18 inches making the ark 450 feet long, 75 feet broad and 45 feet high, with a displacement of 14,000 tons its carrying capacity equalled that of 522 standard railroad stock cars (each of which can hold 240 sheep). Only 188 cars would be required to hold 45,000 sheep-sized animals, leaving three trains of 104 cars each for food, Noah's family, and 'range' for the animals. Today it is estimated that there are 17,600 species of animals, making 45,000 a likely approximation of the number Noah might have taken into the ark."""	Education & Reference
"Do the Blind dream? .  . Yes, blind people do dream. What they see in their dreams depends on how much they could ever see. If someone has been totally blind since birth, they only have auditory dreams. If someone  has had a measure of sight, then that person dreams with that measure of sight. Those individuials who have had some sight before they went blind can dream as though they can see, colors included. \n\nIN all fairness, one should first look at what a dream is.. really.. this must be understood before the question could be fully answered. The word ""dream"" has four interrelated meanings that follow one from another. When we put them altogether, we know what a dream is. \n\nFirst, a ""dream"" is a form of thinking that occurs when (a) there is a certain, as yet undetermined, minimal level of brain activation, and (b) external stimuli are blocked from entry into the mind, and (c) the system we call the ""self system"" (the ""I,"" the ""me"") is shut down.\n\nSecond, a ""dream"" is something we ""experience"" because the thinking is very real and makes use of our senses -- especially seeing and hearing; because usually we are the main actor; and because a dream is sometimes very emotional (but not always). \n\nThird, a ""dream"" is what we remember in the morning, so it is ""a memory"" of the dreaming experience. \n\nFourth, a ""dream"" can also mean the spoken or written ""report"" we give to others about that experience, which is the only way anyone else can ever know about another person's dreams (because they can't be seen by others or told about by us while they are happening). \n\nSO....in summation (keeping in mind what dreams are),\n\nThere are no visual images in the dreams of those born without any ability to experience visual imagery in waking life. \n\nIndividuals who become blind before the age of five seldom experience visual imagery in their dreams, there has been  reports some visual imagery in six schoolchildren who lost their sight before age five. \n\nThose who become sightless between the ages of five and seven may or may not retain some visual imagery. \n\nMost people who lost their vision after age seven continue to experience at least some visual imagery, although its frequency and clarity often fade with time."

"If Jimmy Cracked Corn and Nobody Cared, Then Why Did They Write A Song About It? .  . cause he's an alchoholic\n\nthe connection with corn liquor produced in the South, since corn is ""cracked"" before being mixed with other ingredients and fermented into alcohol. In the US, this industry is strongly associated with Southern states, especially the illegal ""moonshine"" corn whiskey that was produced secretly to avoid government taxation in the 1800s. On a recent visit to my parents, who live down in North Carolina, we visited a cultural museum where one of the featured exhibits was a still (the equipment for producing corn whiskey.) To the best of my knowledge, there are no stills in museums up here in Boston. Most sources that believe this to be the root of the word point to song The Blue Tail Fly (more popularly known as Jimmy Crack Corn) which tells the story of a slave who escapes punishment when his master is killed in a riding accident - even though it happened because he failed to keep flies from biting the master's nervous horse."

Generally, the earliest entity considered a part of the Persian Empire is Persia's Achaemenid dynasty (648–330 BC), a united Aryan-indigenous kingdom that originated in the region now known as Fars and was formed under Cyrus the Great.

"What was Captain Hook's name before the accident? .  . You are ALL wrong. It was Captain James Shaft. \n\nThe true story of Captain James Hook, the pirate supreme of Never Never Land is a closely guarded secret. If the truth got out, children would be truly terrified. \n\nLong ago in the land of Never Never, Tinkerbelle was married to the gorgeously divine fairy price Jimmyshaft. You see, Bell is her maiden name she was once known as Tikershaft. Any who, one day the young child Peter arrived in Never Never Land and Tinkerbelle asked her husband if that could take him in. Jimmyshaft, being the kind fairy he was agreed. But after a time, Tinker started to fall in love with Peter, as any mother figure would.  Jimmyshaft got very jalousie because all of Tinks time was spent looking after Peter. She didn’t have time to play fairy games and use her magic to make Jimmyshaft happy all the time. One day, Jimmyshaft got so mad that he took a frying pan from the kitchen and hit pan in the head. Tinkerbelle got so mad that she through Jimmyshaft out of the house. This of course caused all sorts of rumors and destroyed the princes image. He was so ashamed that he exiled himself from the rest of the fairy folks and went to live with all the other bad fairs and imps. \n\nOne day many years later, Jimmyshaft saw Peter playing by the water. He pushed Peter in the water. As he did, he started laughing and yelled out, Look at the little pan head sink. Much to Jimmyshafts surprise, Peter knew how to swim. Peter got out of the water and tried swat Jimmyshaft, but he was just too quick and too small. Peter called out, if you were just a little bigger, I'd beat you silly. \n\nFor a long time this continued. Jimmyshaft would play a prank on Peter calling him pan head and Peter, now known as Peter Panhead, would yell out, ""If you where just a little bigger.""  \n\nEventually, after a long time passed, Jimmyshaft was tired of the game.  The final straw was when his now ex-wife Tinkerbelle taught Peter how to fly. He knew the only way he would ever get rid of the pesky Peter Panhead now was to drown him in the sea, but Jimmyshaft was just too small to do the job. So Jimmyshaft used the last of his fairy magic and turned himself and all of the fallen fairies and imps into pirates. There one solitary mission was to destroy the poor Pater Panhead. \n\nThe rest of the story you know. The pirates agreed that Jimmyshaft should be the captain but Captain Jimmyshaft just didn’t sound frightening so he changes his name to Captain James Shaft. But on the very first crusade to get Peter, Peter got the best of the old Pirate Captain and the Crock got his hand. This earned Peter the respect of the other inhabitants of Never Land and they stopped calling him Pan head and simply called him Pan...This later became a time like Khan or Lord. (see the Move Hook as reference.) And the now one handed Pirate Captain James Shaft was forever known as James Hook.\n\nWell, what do you think!  It doesn’t matter, because that's my story and I'm stick'n to it."	Entertainment & Music

I would like to consulitate a home loan,car loans, personal loans and some credit card debts plus 5000 to do some repairs and new furniture and so forth.  I would like a payment of about 550 and pay off in 10 years. . For a monthly payment of $550, paying off in 10 years, you can only borrow around $50,000 (at 6.125%). So that covers your debts and repairs, but not much else. \n\nUnfortunately, depending how much you owe on your house, you probably wouldn't get a rate of 6.125%.

Advice appreciated . I recommend intel CPUs if you want them for watching dvds, they are still simply the best rated internationally by IEEE and multiple other organizations, especially for media.  BUT stear clear of celuron processors they are the cheap version of pentium and you will regret it if you don't pay the extra for pentium.  \n\nIn regards to the laptop, acer is a very good brand, rated up there among the best along with toshiba and others.  Steer clear of sony and dell they are not that great and you pay too much for name.  \n\nI do however recommend that if you are considering a major purchase such as this that you wait until windows vista comes out in the next few months and purchase a while after that to give some time for them to patch, etc.  The new windows will revolutionize many pc components capabilities.\nHope this helps	Computers & Internet

"If time slows when nearing the speed of light would light ""think"" it took less than a year to go 1 light year? . I'm puzzled by the time paradox of near-light-speed travel. If time would seem to pass more slowly to a high-speed traveller, why wouldn't it also seem to pass more slowly from the perspective of light, itself? In other words, why do we say that it takes light a year to travel a light year? To us, perhaps, it does, but from the light's perspective, wouldn't it take much less time to go that distance, or even no time at all? And, if not, why not? . if you were traveling at the speed of light, which would basically make you light itself, time would never pass and you would be unaware of the concept of time.  \nwhen you talk about the light year, that's a measurement of distance- the distance that something traveling at 180,000 miles per second goes in a year.  i know that it's confusing, because then you get into the concepts of proper and coordinate time, and proper and coordinate distance.\nbasically, if you are traveling at exactly the speed of light, which you cannot do, from your perspective it would take no time to travel anywhere, and therefore you would travel no distance.  it's pretty freaky stuff.\nwe look at it a different way because we have a different perspective and travel at a different speed.\ngosh i love relativity."

where can i find real wholesale prices? . ipods, tv, fragrances, perfume, psp, . Your question is a very common one. Naturally everyone wants true wholesale pricing but the answer really depends on how much business potential you can offer to the wholesaler or distributor. You can only get wholesale pricing (legitimate) with a business license and/or Tax ID to show that you are a reseller. If they don't ask for the form(s), I can assure you they are not legitimate. You can find directories of wholesalers at your local library... they are a little too expensive to buiy on your own. Try to find some that will work with you as a small business but remember these places are bombarded with requests to buy products at wholesale pricing and they won't do it for a few of this and a couple of that. It's got to be a win-win situation for you and the wholesaler so sharpen your presentation and ask for a break to get your business running.	Business & Finance

"what is the length and duration of one revolution of the sun around the center of the milkyway galixy? . I am trying to calculate the distance traveled (In light years) for a 46 year old person at 38 north latitude. Including the rotation of earth , orbit around the sun and the suns revolution around the center of the milkyway. I don't think I can go farther than that as I don't beleve there is a center to the universe the galixys travel could be measured aginst. Mike . Firstly, the milky way is in a galatic cluster, and that is in a super cluster.  (There's a lot of gravity out there.)  But those structures are too far away to detect sideway movement, only towards or away.  Also, their motion is highly relativistic.  So Galaxy is a natural place to stop.\n\nThe first figure will probably be within the margin of error for the second and third.  So, as I check wikipedia, I see that the sun is orbitting the galaxy at a rate of 217 kilometer per second and the earth is rotating around the sun at 29.783 km/s.  So, this person has traveled somewhere in excess (depending on how many seconds more than 46 years old they are) of 358,242,443,236.8 kilometers, or 222,468,557,250.0528 miles.  \n\nAlso, just as a comment, there is no ""point"" of the big bang.

why do some company's charge sales tax and some don't? . If you have the source to your information please list it. . It depends on the state you live in and what is a taxable item in that state.\n\nFor instance, New Hampshire has no sales tax, so nothing is taxed.  In Massachusetts, there is a 5% tax on everything but clothing and food.\n\nIn Tennessee, there is a 7% sales tax on almost everything (food is a 6% tax) because the state doesn't take an income tax, so they make it back in sales tax.\n\nMost times, if you are shipping something you have bought online, they will apply your states sales tax once you fill in the information about yourself.\n\nSome places also don't have to pay a sales tax.  A non-profit organization (charity, schools, etc) will have a certificate to prove their tax-exempt status for most items.  If they have an event to raise money, they don't have to pay sales tax for the location or food, however, alcohol is always taxable if the state applies it.\n\nYou can check out individual sites for states to see which states have which taxes in more detail, but here is a summary of the states and their sales taxes:\nhttp://www.taxadmin.org/fta/rate/sales.html	Business & Finance

"how many types of lipo-proteins are there? .  . A lipoprotein is a biochemical assembly that contains both proteins and lipids. The lipids or their derivatives may be covalently or non-covalently bound to the proteins. Many enzymes, transporters, structural proteins, antigens, adhesins and toxins are lipoproteins. Examples include the high density and low density lipoproteins of the blood, the transmembrane proteins of the mitochondrion and the chloroplast, and bacterial lipoproteins.\n\nGeneral categories of lipoproteins, listed in order from larger and less dense (more fat than protein) to smaller and more dense (more protein, less fat):\n\nChylomicrons - carry triacylglycerol (fat) from the intestines to the liver and to adipose tissue. \n\nVery low density lipoproteins - carry (newly synthesised) triacylglycerol from the liver to adipose tissue.\n \nIntermediate density lipoproteins - are intermediate between VLDL and LDL. They are not usually detectable in the blood. \nLow density lipoproteins - carry cholesterol from the liver to cells of the body. Sometimes referred to as the ""bad cholesterol"" lipoprotein. \n\nHigh density lipoproteins - collects cholesterol from the body's tissues, and brings it back to the liver. Sometimes referred to as the ""good cholesterol"" lipoprotein. \n\nAlpha and beta\nIt is also possible to classify lipoproteins as ""alpha"" and ""beta"", akin to the classification of proteins in serum protein electrophoresis. This terminolgy is sometimes used in describing lipid disorders such as Abetalipoproteinemia.\n\nThat's My Best Answer!"	Science & Mathematics
"you decide, is she (they) interested in me? . Not that I would be interested, for religious reasons, but I just want to know: ..........At my university, I wear Islamic clothes. As expected I get a lot of looks from everyone, as noone else there wears anything like it. But if someone keeps looking, like every day, are they checking me out, or still observing my clothes? I would think that they wouldn't keep looking at me becuase of my clothes, any further peeks (after first several) would have to do with them checking me out. ..........There are these girls one of my class who always look at me. sometimes, they look at me together (all three of them turn around and look) I always catch them looking at me. could it be a possibility that they are looking at me thinking ""why does this guy keep looking at us"" when in reality thats thats what I'm thinking the thats the only reason im looking at them (even tho they are madly cute).......... .what do you guys think  They are interested in me, or just looking at me because of what I wea . I've seen some of the most beautiful women at KSU that happens to be Islamic. And I've always wondered the same thing that you are asking. Do they think that I'm looking at them because they're dressed differently, or do they even realize that they have the most gorgeous eyes that I've ever seen?!  <---This all depends on the onlooker. I tend to smile at women when I look at them (to show that no ill-will is meant by my repeated ""glances"" ;) ), because I have enough confidence to.  I'm assuming women will smile to show their interest in you if they find you attractive as well. The truth is, this will be different for everyone. I'm not religious myself, but I can acknowledge a beautiful person when I see one. ---Additionally, don't be concern with what others think.

I'm 15 by the way. . I'm sorry you're in pain sweetie. You could take some paracetamol as well to try to help ease the pain, and you could try rinsing your mouth with a hot salt water rinse, that sometimes helps me when I get toothache. Avoid anything that makes it worse, so don't eat anything sweet, and make sure you keep the cavity clean - rinse it out after every time you eat. If it gets worse, you should probably call the dentist to see if he can fit you in any sooner. Hope you feel better soon, there's nothing worse than a toothache!	Health

I want to go into the Air Force when i get out of high school, but i don't know how to break it to my parents b/c my sister wants to write and she wants to go into some kind of english career.  my uncle, my aunt, and both of my grandpas were in the armed forces, my uncle in the air force, maybe b/c my uncle told me stories.  i have no idea, but i told my parents that i was thinking about the military, but they flipped out at me and were like, ""why can't u be more like your sister"" or ""there are other ways to serve your country than to go out and fight. you could be a doctor or a lawyer.""  personally, i have never liked any of that stuff.  i don't know what i should do, can anyone tell me if i should go into the air force or should i do something else and go along w/ my parents?? can someone please help me?!?!? . Joining the Air Force was the best thing that I ever did with my life. I was 20 years old, failing college, living with my parents, hardly making any money, and watching all of my friends do things with their lives..so I finally decided to do something with mine.  My family comes from a big military background as well and it was an easy decision for what branch to go into such as the Air Force. The military in general is not for everyone. Its a big lifestyle change that you will need to become assumed to.  You're parents are naturally scared because they love you and don't want you to get hurt, which the chances of that happening with you in the Air Force depending on what career field you get, are slim to none.  The Air Force is a GREAT way to meet to friends that you'll keep for life, get an education, see the world, make an honest paycheck, and be a part of an organization that you can feel proud to be in. Looks great on a resume if you decide to get out in four years as well.  You're YOUNG and time is on your side, I know four years sounds like a really long time but it goes by SO fast.

"If you believe in the big bang and build a wall at the edge of the universe, what is on the other side? .  .

So as you headed outward, first you'd blow by the last bit of radiation into very high energy vacuum state that would probably rip every molecule in you to shreds, but if you could find someway to avoid that and acutally hit the end of space time you'd be unable to move because you can only change position along (x,y,z) over time. As soon as spacetime ended you'd come to a stop; the physics of movement would not work anymore. Within an imperceptible fragment of a second the edge of the universe would catch back up to you and you'd be sitting there wondering what happened (if you noticed anything at all). You could keep trying for an eternity but you'd never be able to leave or ""see"" anything because you're eyes and senses are biased to the physical stimuli of this universe, not the trans-dimensional stuff between universes.

Since you're a beginner and not interested in self defense I would recommend the Ruger MKII or MKIII for a variety of reasons.\n\n1.) It takes .22 LR rounds which are extremely cheap.  Approximately $90 for 2500 rounds in the U.S.\n\n2.) It has low recoil which is good for a novice.\n\n3.) It has safety features that are not found on other guns.  Such as not allowing the gun to go off when the magazine has been removed; an internal locking device; and a round chambered indicator.  Which is good for a novice.\n\n4) It's an accurate gun good for competition shooting.\n\n5.) It has adjustable sights which is good for competition shooting.\n\n6.) It already comes which a weaver style mount so you can mount a scope on it if you'd like.  Which is good for competition shooting.\n\n7.) This gun is affordable anywhere from $229-310\n\nReviews for the Ruger MKII: \n\nhttp://www.chuckhawks.com/dktaylor.htm\nhttp://mywebpages.comcast.net/shooter2_indy/mk2.html\n\nReviews for the MK III\n\nhttp://www.gunblast.com/Ruger_MarkIII-Hunter.htm\n\n\nSo in conclusion I think that the Ruger MK II or MK III would make a good target gun for a novice shooter.

"in microsoft visual c++  , how can i hide private members of a class in a static link library? . i wrote a static link library in two files : code.cpp and header.h , header.h includes the interface of a class named Class1 , which have private members and public members , and code.cpp includes the implementation of that class , i dont want the programmer who uses the static link library to see the private members decleration of the class (Class1) , if i give header.h to the programmer he will know the declaration of the private members , and if i exclude the private members of his copy of header.h , it class (Class1) will not work. . One way to do it is to make Class1 call some other class for all actual implementation. So you make a new class, Class1Impl, which does all the real work.

the best way to give up bad habbits? . i smoke, i drink, i eat chocolate, i drink soda, i dont save money, and i think they are all bad habbits. . Do you think they're bad because You/ Yourself don't approve of them . . . or do you think they're bad because of what others have been telling you?\n\nDon't 'quit' doing anything because other people want you to, quit because that's a change in your life that you want to make.  \n\nI smoke cigarettes, I smoke pot, I eat fatty foods, I swear like a sailor, I get upset sometimes when people don't do what I want, I indulge in chocolate and sex . . . but you know what . . . I only want to quit smoking so I can ride a bike again, unless I get my lungs in good enough shape where I can do both!  \n\nBad is in the eye of the beholder . . . if you want to quit for your own self improvment, then the best way to stop is to try to put your mind in a place where you don't care about any of those things anymore.  Stopping the action doesn't solve anything . . . but stopping the connection to it is biggest and hardest thing to do.	Health

The surf control says access denied contact your system administrator. Please help.... . The admin got certainly told from the management to install this feature and block all IM transfer on the local Intranet and to the Internet.\nI guess, to avoid too much abuse !

"Why do so many people immigrate to the US? .

"why do we often use taq dna polymerase in a pcr? .  . taq polymerase originated in a thermophile, Thermus aquaticus.  At this point, the taq you actually use is probably the taq gene cloned into E. coli.\n\nAnyhow, as a thermophile, Thermus aquaticus lives in very high temperatures, and its enzymes can also function at the elevated temps.  This is important for PCR, where your extension is at 70C.  THe ability to withstand high temps is also important because of the denaturation step which separates your strands and allows for the continued amplification of PCR product.  \n\n""Back in the day"" before thermostable polymerases, each round of amplificatin required the addition of new enzyme.  You can imagine how fun that must have been.\n\nNew thermostable enzymes are more thermostable, or faster, or have higher fidelity, etc.  Taq, however, for all of its short coming, is still mega cheap and used quite a bit."

"What the heck is Canada's ""Boxing Day?""? .  . There is great dispute over the true origins of Boxing Day. The more common stories include:\n\nCenturies ago, merchants would present their servants food and fruits as a form of Yuletide tip. Naturally, the gifts of food and fruit were packed in boxes, hence the term ""Boxing Day"". \nIn feudal times, Christmas was a reason for a gathering of extended families. All the serfs would gather their families in the manor of their lord, which made it easier for the lord of the estate to hand out annual stipends to the serfs. After all the Christmas parties on December 26, the lord of the estate would give practical goods such as cloth, grains, and tools to the serfs who lived on his land. Each family would get a box full of such goods the day after Christmas. Under this explanation, there was nothing voluntary about this transaction; the lord of the manor was obliged to supply these goods. Because of the boxes being given out, the day was called Boxing Day. \nIn Britain many years ago, it was common practice for the servants to carry boxes to their employers when they arrived for their day's work on the day after Christmas (December 25). Their employers would then put coins in the boxes as special end-of-year gifts. This can be compared with the modern day concept of Christmas bonuses. The servants carried boxes for the coins, hence the name Boxing Day. \nIn churches, it was traditional to open the church's donation box on Christmas day, and the money in the donation box was to be distributed to the poorer or lower class citizens on the next day. In this case, the ""box"" in ""Boxing Day"" comes from that one gigantic lockbox in which the donations were left. \nIn Britain because many servants had to work for their employers on Christmas day they would instead open their presents (i.e., boxes) the next day, which therefore became known as Boxing Day."

What are the most simplest and basics ways to treat body odor normally at home? .  . Good hygene of course.  Also, what you eat (garlic for example) may be a contibuting factor in body odor orally and through the sweat glands.  A good absorbing powder (Gold Bond) may help subdue the sweating factor as well as the use of a good deodorant. Have your blood and urine checked to see if you have abnormal body chemistries..and see a dentist if the problem is persistant ORAL odor.  If your feet are part of the problem...you may have fungal infections...see  a podiatrist or your own general physician for medications to eliminate the problem.\n\nAlso, you may have to bathe more frequently and change into fresh clean clothes more frequently.

"How does a blind person get their driver’s license? . I’m in Texas.  I have a friend who, because of his diabetes, for all intensive purposes is blind.  Over a short period of time he’s had multiple injury accidents because he didn’t see the other drivers. I know for a fact he can’t see other drivers on the road too well or traffic signals until he’s right upon them. \n\nWhen he went to get his license renewed, they made him take an eye exam which he failed. Today he told me he got his license renewed. \n\nHe says he went the eye doctor, told her he’s a diabetic and would lose his independence.  The doctor wrote him a note exempting him from the eye exam.  Not if, but when he has his next accident and people are hurt or killed, who will be liable? The insurance company which is aware of his multiple at fault accidents keeps insuring him and the eye doctor wrote him the note.  This doesn’t make any sense to me at all.  Does either the insurance company or the eye doctor bear any responsibility for the next injury accident? . From my recollection, people who fail the vision part of the driving exam get told to see an eye doctor.  It is up to the doctor to determine whether the problem is vision-related or cognitive, and whether it ought to keep the person from driving.\n\nIn the case of people who are legally blind or otherwise can't drive, the government does issue non-driver identification cards that can be used like a driver's licence for ID, but not for driving.\n\nIf the eye doctor feels a person failed the vision part of the driving exam because of a temporary problem (an eye infection that affected vision temporarily, for instance), they can write out a pass that basically says ""This person passed the exam at my office"" for them to bring back to the DMV.  Most of the time, though, it's left up to the doctor to explain to the 70-year-old why their eyesight is too bad for them to drive anymore."	Politics & Government
what are human bones made of? .  . Bone consists of a chemical mixture of inorganic salts (65 to 70 per cent) and various organic substances (30 to 35 per cent) and is both hard and elastic. Its hardness is derived from inorganic constituents, principally calcium phosphate and calcium carbonate, with small amounts of fluorides, sulphates, and chlorides; its elasticity is derived from such organic substances as gelatin, collagen, and traces of elastin, cellular material, and fats. Internal tubular structures called Haversian canals contain nerve tissues and blood vessels that provide bones with organic nourishment. Surrounding these canals is a somewhat porous tissue composed of thin plates, known as lamellae, and usually containing cavities filled with a network of connective tissue called marrow or myeloid tissue. Bone marrow accounts for from 2 to 5 per cent of the body weight of a person and consists of tissue of two types. Yellow bone marrow is made up principally of fat, and red bone marrow is tissue in which red and white blood cells and blood platelets originate. The external portions of bones, enclosing all the components mentioned above, include the compact and hardest of all bone tissue, which is in turn generally sheathed by a vascular, fibrous membrane known as the periosteum.

Possibly yes, there are two scenarios:\n\n1) depreciation deductions are based on when the property is 'placed in service' i.e. in use in the income-producing activity. If the property isn't being used in the business until 2007, then you would start depreciating at that point.\n\n2) even if it was 'placed in service' in 2006, you would still be getting depreciation deductions in 2007	Business & Finance

How did Planck influence the development of modern atomic theory? .  . Planck was one of the people who was thinking of energy as being delivered in discrete amounts or bundles.  This was one of the clues that lead Einstein to conclude in his 'Photo-electric Effect' experiments that, again, energy was being absorbed at only very specific frequencies and possibly in specific bundles of energy.\n\nThen you get to thinking of light as photons to carry the energy and materials seem to only absorb special kinds of bundles of energy and some guys in Stockholm start thinking that energy changes in atoms occur in discrete quanta.  Neils Bohr and friends were trying to come up with equations to describe the orbit of the electron around the nucleus and put some of the Planck stuff together with the Einstein stuff and came up with the idea that electrons could only change orbits according to the energy quanta that they absorbed and emitted.\n\nFrom all this we get the basics of quantum mechanics, sub-atomic orbital mechanics, lasers, fluorescent lights, bunches of stuff :).

Serious question about why people do this......? . I am 57 years old, and I don't remember smoking grass, or doing drugs were so out in the open.  So, why do people smoke grass, and do drugs?  Why can't they just enjoy life, and make the best of life?  I am truly serious I don't understand why people do drugs. . I am 53 and I went through the drug scene growing up and to be honest with you I enjoy being sober.  Life is so grand that you don't need the artificial highs to enjoy it.  I get high when I see my children and my grandchildren.  I catch a buzz when I read my Bible and go to church.  I get happy when I am just with my wife watching television or talking to one another.  There is life after drugs and alcohol.  I regret the times that I have missed by being high, I will never get those years back, but I do not dwell on it and just go forward.	Entertainment & Music

Check out the book Cliff and Joy Penner's ""The Gift of Sex"". It was recommended to all married couples in our church by our pastor.

"can any plz tell me step by step to install o/s & what to do before ins. it.? . it is about computer only.basically assembling. . his is where we come in and try to lend a hand by providing to some of our novice users a few pointers about installing the Microsoft Windows XP operating system.\n\nBefore beginning the installation please make sure you have collected all of the important disks received when the computer was purchased, which basically means driver disks for: motherboard, audio, video, network adapter (if you have one) and S-ATA (if you have a S-ATA hard disk). If you are installing Windows XP without Service Pack 2, remove your network cable before commencing. Also, if you are reinstalling Windows, please make sure you have moved all important files from your Desktop, My Documents, Program Files and Windows folders.\n\nNow you can start your computer and enter its BIOS (usually by pressing the Delete button). Search for the boot priority section (it should be in the first menu or in Advanced BIOS Featues) and make sure the first boot device is the CD-ROM drive. Now you can insert the Windows XP installation CD in your optical drive and exit the BIOS (Not without saving of course).\n\nYour computer will restart and after a few seconds will ask you to press a key so it can boot from the CD. Press any key to start the Windows XP installation process. After inspecting your computer, you will be asked to press the F6 key if you have a disk for your S-ATA hard drive. It is very important not to skip or miss this\nstep if you do have an S-ATA hard drive!\n\nIf you have pressed the F6 key, you will be asked to specify your storage controller. Hit the S key, insert the S-ATA driver disk and press Enter. After copying the needed drivers, you will see to the previous screen again. Just press Enter and let the setup process continue.\n\nWhen the setup has finished loading files, you will have to choose between setting up Windows, repair an existing Windows installation and exiting the setup. You will of course press the Enter key which brings you to the License Agreement screen. You can agree by pressing F8 or disagree by pressing the Escape key (this will stop the installation process).\n\nThe next screen is a partition manager; it will display available partitions and unused space on your hard drive. You can create a partition by pressing C, delete one by press D or use the arrow keys to select the partition on which Windows XP will be installed. We do not advise you to delete partitions if you do not know exactly what this means. If the selected partition already has Windows installed on it, you will have to choose between using the same partition for your installation and deleting the old Windows (press L) or using another partition (press Escape). If the hard drive doesn’t have any partitions (only unused space), you must create one: just press C and choose the partition size. After selecting a partition, the setup will ask you to format the selected partition. If you’ve just created the partition or if it doesn’t store any valuable information, you can use the quick NTFS format, but if the partition already existed and if you have important files stored on in it, you can choose to ""Leave the current file system intact (no changes)"".\n\nThe setup will now start copying files and then reboot and install devices (please note that user intervention is not needed in any way, you might as well leave the computer alone until the setup finishes device installation). You have surely noticed that the device installation has began in a new, more user friendly interface and when it’s over a window will appear requesting you to modify your Regional and Language Settings. To help certain services provide you with local information, you may choose your country in Location menu. By pressing Customize you can select number settings (decimal symbol, digit grouping, negative sign symbol, measurement system, etc), currency settings (currency symbol, decimal symbol, etc), time settings (time format, time separator) and date settings (short date format"	Computers & Internet

It's a metabolism thing...you need to start regulating yourself and eating more regularly, both in time (eat at the same times each day) and in amount. Ever wonder why you feel hungry right after a big meal sometimes? It's your metabolism speeding up to cope with a big meal and digesting quickly. Then the next day you don't feel like eating anything because your metabolism is sluggish after the indulgence.\n\nSo, start eating more in routine, and the ups and downs of your appetite should regulate.

Are humans going to become immune to certain diseases such as cancer in the future? .  . Some, yes. For example, a new vaccine is now promising to significantly reduce the cases of cervical cancer. It is estimated that as many as 2/3 of the cases of cervical cancer are caused by the human papilloma virus (HPV). It follows, therefore, that reducing the incidence of infection from HPV will also reduce the incidence of cervical cancer. Viruses as well as bacteria have been implicated in a number of other cancers. Heliobacter pylori (H Pylori) infections in the gastrointestinal tract have been linked to certain lymphomas of the gut. \n\nViruses sometimes work indirectly in causing cancers. For example, both AIDS and hepatitis are caused by viruses and they subsequently weaken the body and make it more susceptible to cancer. AIDS destroys the immune system and makes it harder for the body to ward off viruses, bacteria, and cancer cells.  Sadly, people suffering from AIDS are at a much higher risk for a multitude of cancers which the body would normally be able to protect itself from (including viruses like Epstein-Barr and certain herpesviruses that are themselves linked to cancer). Hepatitis increases the likelihood of liver cancer.\n\nHopefully, researchers will one day find an effective vaccine against viruses that are in one way or another linked to cancer.	Health
What is postscript type 1 and what is the history behind it? .  . Postscript is a page definition language. It is a very powerful language but at its root it is meant to descibe the lines, arcs, text, and images on a printed page. It was originally developed at Xerox Parc, and because Xerox had no interesting in commercializing it, some Xerox employees took it and started Adobe. Micrsoft then licensed postscript technology and the rest is history. Postscript type 1 defines an initial set of commands, postscript type 2 is a newer version that supports a wider set of operations. For instance I believe gradients are supported in type 2 but not type 1.	Computers & Internet

Are you confident enough about who you are to make decisions about what you do by what you think in your heart rather than by what someone else does or does not do?\nYou are 15 and life only gets more complicated the older you get.  Use this time in your life to prepare yourself for success in your adult years.  Education is so important.  Stay focused on what is productive and not on silly whims of silly boys.	Society & Culture

"What is the history behind the easter bunny? .  . Here's your answer:\n\n""Here comes Peter Cottontail\nhoppin' down the bunny trail \nHippity hoppity \nEasters on its way!""\n\nThe Easter bunny has its origin in pre-Christian fertility lore. The Hare and the Rabbit were the most fertile animals known and they served as symbols of the new life during the Spring season. \nThe bunny as an Easter symbol seems to have it's origins in Germany, where it was first mentioned in German writings in the 1500s. The first edible Easter bunnies were made in Germany during the early 1800s. And were made of pastry and sugar. \n\nThe Easter bunny was introduced to American folklore by the German settlers who arrived in the Pennsylvania Dutch country during the 1700s. The arrival of the ""Oschter Haws"" was considered ""childhood's greatest pleasure"" next to a visit from Christ-Kindel on Christmas Eve. The children believed that if they were good the ""Oschter Haws"" would lay a nest of colored eggs. \n\nThe children would build their nest in a secluded place in the home, the barn or the garden. Boys would use their caps and girls their bonnets to make the nests . The use of elaborate Easter baskets would come later as the tradition of the Easter bunny spread through out the country.\n\n\n""Oh! here comes Peter Cottontail, \nHoppin' down the bunny trail, \nHippity hoppity\nHappy Easter day"" \n\nTiff"	Society & Culture

"what is the signifigance of 360 degrees, why not divide a circle into 500 deg. or 1000, why 360? .  . The same people who invented the wheel five or six thousand years ago (the Mesopotamians) also fancied the number sixty, basing their entire number system on it. No one seems to know exactly why--it might even have been related to trade: for commercial purposes, it's helpful to use a number that has many factors, and sixty has twelve of them, more than any other manageable number.... Whatever the reason, the Babylonians picked the system up and passed it on to the Egyptians, who used it to divide the circle into 360 degrees (6 x 60) and who also gave us the symbol for degrees. The Egyptians divided spheres into 360 degrees as well, assigning the first latitude and longitude lines to the earth. This ancient system for dividing the circle has persisted to the present. Each degree of the circle is divided into 60 minutes (60') and each minute into 60 seconds (60"").\n\nFor more information about the origin of the system for dividing a circle into 360 degrees see also:\n\nBynum, W. F. Dictionary of the History of Science, Princeton University Press, Princeton, N.J., 1981. (R 509 B99) \n""Circle -- History"", Encyclopedia Americana, (1992) vol. 6, p.733. \nGettings, Fred.

Are you ready to give you life up for the lord? . We Americans are so lucky that we live in a country that we are allow to worship and praise Christ and there are countries where if your were caught worshiping him you would be kill, if you don’t deny Christ you are killed. I’ve ask myself this question am I ready or willing to die for Christ? I’m learing how to live my life for the lord but will I give it up when need? Its so easy to say yes I will but when the time comes will I? To be honest I don’t know. I know there is life in him I know when I do die that I will be with him. But even with  that said im still scary of death. Why? I don’t know, all i can do now is pray that someday i will be ready right? Are you ready to give you life up for the lord . A couple years ago, I had a friend whom I hadn't seen in almost a year because he had developed a serious drug habit and I had a not quite one year old daughter to take care of, and was starting to get my own life together. One day I heard his name on the radio- he had been shot seven times in the back of his head and his body was found in a dumpster outside a recycling plant. I later found out from my daughter's father, who still saw my friend on a pretty regular basis, that two weeks before he was murdered, my friend had become a Christian. The reason he had been killed was because he was trying to get out of his old lifestyle and away from his old friends and start a new life following Christ. His former friends apparently thought he was really just trying to make an excuse to go and tell the police about them and their drug use, so they killed him. From the story I heard of what happened that night, the people who shot him had asked him to go somewhere with him, and he was scared to go because he knew they were up to something. But, despite the fact that he was afraid, I think he was ready to give up his life because he had accepted Jesus as his savior before he died. Chances are, although I can't say for sure, you will not be killed for your faith, but even if you are, you are already ready because of your faith.	Society & Culture

In the event of foreclosure of a home is the landlord allowed to collect money from the tenant? . rented a home from a woman who presented the house through a reality company as being avaialble for 12 month lease. Within the first week I moved in a mortgage loan collector came to the door, and said he had been to the property for several weeks trying to give notice, but the property was vacant. My landlord 2 weeks later came to me, and confirmed that the house was in the process of forclosure, and that my family, and I have to leave. Up front I gave her $1175.00 for security, and $1175.00 to the leasing company she listed the home through as first months rent counted to their comission ( I moved in the 10th of OCT and my prorate was to be paid in November). My landlord returned my security, and check for my 2nd month's rent uncashed, but I believe the reality company is also responsible for presenting me with a lease that was never valid, and should return the money I paid to them, and then they go after my lanlord for commiting fraud. . It depends upon where you are located.\n\nIf the house is under foreclosure it is a legal proceeding and if the court has not issued an order assigning the rents to the court or to the mortgage holder then it would be payable to the landlord.\n\nI would stay in the house as long as possible without paying rent to anyone. Once you have recouped your costs from the free rent then either move or contact the mortgage company. Maybe there is an opportunity to become a homeowner.\n\nIf either side provides a court order saying they are entitle to receive the rent then advise the party that you have prepaid X$ to the owner and her Realtor. And will vacate one it is either repaid or been compensated by free rent.\n\nThe mortgage holder will like the idea of someone occupying the house until they are ready to sell it. It is free protection for their property.	Business & Finance

"does one go to hell if..........? . thay cannot forgive or reconcile with their parents?\n\nat d old students re-union i was surprised at the number of women who had a grudge against their mothers and the number who men who blamed their parents for their misery. \n\nthere was a woman who felt that her parents had squashed all her dreams when they paid for her brother's medical education. they had no money left for her, so she had to work for a living just after high school. the brother has moved on and now she has to look after her parents single handedly. she is glad she has them, but always wishes that they had paid for her education. as as kid she always wanted to give them a big house and happiness.\n\nthen there were people whose parents had seperated when they were small. they never had a parent, and have not been able to forgive the parent that brought them up for creating the vaccum in their lives. \n\nthe question is: with so  much bitterness against their parents, will they ever be able to make it to heaven?? . John Milton, in Paradise Lost said, ""The mind is its own place and in itself can make a Hell of Heaven, a Heaven of Hell.""  Thus, we create our own destiny anew in each and every moment.  Bitterness is a thorn deep below the skin of our consciousness that continues to fester as long as we harbor it.  To be free, one must let go of the past and take responsibility for their feelings and their actions.  It is irresponsible to blame one's feelings on another.  Where do the feelings emanate from?  Within ourselves, we create them.  Something outside may be the catalyst for such feelings, but we create them and react to our self-made feelings.  \n     I have a question for your question - why wait until you are dead to find out?  Why not try to be free from our self-created suffering and live in peace right this second?\n\n  As the maxim goes:  To err is human.  To forgive, divine."	Society & Culture
How would you go about writing a six page paper on a Roman god or goddess?Q? . Ok, I'm in 8th grade taking a latin class in which we have to write a paper on a roman godess. I have Minerva, goddess of wisdom. it says we have to write about thier personal charcterisitics, the way they looked, thier powers, some myths surrounding them etc... we also have to answer the question of why the romans named them what they did & I also need to compare and contrast them with thier greek counterparts. Can someone help me with my project by giving me some helpful sites or information? I, so far, have not found anything very useful... \nThank you so much to whoever can help!!! . I would use a basic outline of:\nI. Introduction\nII. Appearance and Personality\nIII. Origin of name, and other names (most Roman God/desses had several names, since as the roman's empire spread the local god/desses tended to be intergrated withing the Roman God/desses)\nIII. Powers\nIV. Contrast with Greek counterparts\nV. Conclusion\n\nAnd I would interspert some myths throughout the essay, in points they would make sense, for example I would probably start out with a myth as an introduction. \n\nSome website references are in the source section	Education & Reference

"If ur school has a dance team and cheerleading squad...would u consider them equal? . this is more like ur opinion but i really wanna know if i m the one thinking wrong or people have an invalid argument. I am a 9th grade girl in high school & today was our pep rally. I m with a dance team...we are a club not school sponsored but student run. we were to perform and we did. but this one boy ruined our entire performance by jumping into our squads in the middle of performance. he didn't interrupt the groups that went before us but us.....he did it last year as well.\n\ni wanna know just wats going through ur mind right not. should he be punished? did he insult us? are we not compatible to the cheerleaders? just because he's popular and an athlete we are also afraid he might not get punished severly enough.\n\nwho is wacked.....me or him? . Certainly this young man should suffer consequences for interrupting your performance. Whether your performance is as a club or as an athletic team (as the cheer squad at your school), he has no right to disrupt the pep assembly in that manner. \n\nYes, it was an insult to your group. Yes, you are compatible/equal to the cheerleaders. Many schools' dance teams started out as yours is doing: as an informal/intra-mural ""club""/after-school activity and grew into a teacher/school-sponsored activity that is ""legitimate"" and eventually competes against other schools in inter-scholastic competition. \n\nUnfortunately, the punishment that he receives is not up to you and your group members. My suggestion to you would be to have your parents contact the administration and have THEM explain your and their frustration and disapoointment that another student would disrupt a performance of fellow students. The parents of the dance group  should also say that they expect some form of punishment that is somewhat severe for this young fellow since this is the second year in a row he has interrupted a pep rally. They should also emphasize how demoralizing it is for their daughters to have to experience this type of humiliation in front of the whole student body, when their daughters are trying to expose their fellow students to dance and rhythm. \n\nYou are not whacked -- he is!\n\nGood luck..."

on my last question..? . he just told me he loves me....why is he doing this? he tells me he loves me, but we never had sex, he never asked to have sex, so its not about sex. Its about something else....\n\nI think he does love me, but i dont understand..\n\nGod will give me an answer, but id like to hear from you all..\n\nweve been going out for 3-4 years. . From the way you spoke about him in your first question, he doesn't act like he loves you.  Guys will say they love you, but what matters is not what they say, but how they treat you.  If he really loved you, he wouldn't treat you the way he does.  (And it isn't always about sex).	Society & Culture

Gymnastics Anyone?? . does anyone like gymnastics?? i love bars and floor and i am in level 3 and i have 10 medals and 6 trophys!! if you answer this question and do gymnastics can you tell me what level and the amount of medals and trophys!! . I am in level 4, have 12 medals & 12 trophy.\n\nGymnastics is a sport involving the performance of sequences of movements requiring physical strength, flexibility, and kinesthetic awareness, such as handsprings and handstands.\n\nIt developed from fitness and beauty practices used by the ancient Greeks, including skills for mounting and dismounting a horse, and circus performance skills. In ancient times the term implied exercise taken in the nude in the context of a gymnasium, a venue for intellectual and physical education.\n\nIt is often considered a dangerous sport, as the difficult acrobatic maneuvers often performed on equipment high above the ground puts the athlete at risk of serious injury.\n\nDisciplines\nModern gymnastics, as regulated by the Fédération Internationale de Gymnastique incorporates six distinct disciplines:\n\nArtistic gymnastics (further classified as Men's Artistic Gymnastics and Women's Artistic Gymnastics) \nRhythmic gymnastics \nSports aerobics \nSports acrobatics \nTrampolining \nGeneral gymnastics \nPower Tumbling \n\nOf these disciplines, the two sub-disciplines of artistic and rhythmic gymnastics are the best known, having been part of Summer Olympic Games competitions. Individual Trampoline has been included in the Summer Olympics since 2000.\n\nThe discipline of rhythmic gymnastics is competed only by women (although there is a new version of this discipline for men being pioneered in Japan, see Men's rhythmic gymnastics), and involves the performance of five separate routines with the use of five apparatus — ball, ribbon, hoop, clubs, rope — on a floor area, with a much greater emphasis on the aesthetic rather than the acrobatic. Rhythmic routines are scored out of a possible 20 points.\n\nSports aerobics  \nSports aerobics involves the performance of routines by individuals or pairs, emphasizing strength, flexibility, and aerobic fitness rather than acrobatic or balance skills. Routines are performed on a small floor area and generally last 60-90 seconds, being judged out of a total of 10 points. \n\nTrampolining  \nTrampolining consists of four events, individual, synchronized, double mini trampoline and power tumbling. Only individual trampoline is included in the Olympics. Individual routines involve a build-up phase during which the gymnast jumps repeatedly to achieve height, followed by a sequence of ten leaps without pauses during which the gymnast performs a sequence of aerial tumbling skills. Routines are marked out of a maximum score of 10 points. Additional points (with no maximum) can be earned depending on the difficulty of the moves. Synchronized trampoline is similar except that both competitors must perform the routine together and marks are awarded for synchronicity. Double mini trampoline involves a smaller trampoline with a run-up, two moves are performed and the scores marked in a similar manner to individual trampoline. Tumbling involves a sprung track, athletes must perform a succession of tumbling moves and are marked on difficulty and execution.\n \nGeneral Gymnastics  \nGeneral gymnastics, sometimes called group gymnastics, enables people of all ages and abilities to participate in performance troupes of 6 to more than 150 athletes. They perform synchronized, choreographed routines. Troupes may be all one gender or mixed. There are no age divisions in general gymnastics. The largest general gymnastics exhibition is the quadrennial World Gymnaestrada which was first held in 1939. \n\nArtistic Gymnastics  \nArtistic Gymnastics is usually divided into Men's (MAG) and Women's Gymnastics (WAG), each group doing different events; Men compete on Vault, Parallel Bars, the Pommel Horse, the Rings, the High Bar, and on the Floor, while women compete on Floor, Uneven Bars, Vault, and Beam. Though routines performed on each event may be short, they are physically exhausting and push the gymnast's strength, flexibility, endurance and awareness to th	Sports

He does have a crush on you to the level that he can have a crush on a girl. You should be flattered but realize that it is not the same as a crush form a hetero boy.\n\nI don't think your friend is confused - he clearly knows that he prefers the company of men for that type of thing. and he clearly knows that what he feels for you, a crush, is not the same as the crushes or love he feels for a man.\n\nIt's as if a girlfriend of yours said she loved you. You would know what that means and the boundry of that - right?\n\nThis friend of yours will make a great friend if you choose to keep him around - he's honest. He didn't lie, he told you he was gay.

how do I create an e-flyer myself? . I'm trying to promote my services and I think an e-flyer would be an great way to do it. The only problem is that I don't know how can I put together the e-flyer. can anybody help me?? . Well, I'll certainly try.  I like the cat ears, by the way.\n\nFirst, you'll need to find a program to publish the e-flyer in.  This can be MS Word, Publisher, or Quark.  I actually would recommend doing something like this in Fireworks or Photoshop, but if you don't have the budget for those higher end products, I wouldn't worry too much..  For now, I'll go with Word since everyone has that.\n\nI'm not sure what your making your e-flyer for, so that's pretty much your part.  Set up it up however you'd like with pictures, your bio, your service list, contact info, etc.  Whatever you'd like.  The trick will be getting people to see the e-flyer.  I would go about it two ways.  Create a .pdf file, and publish it to a web site and distribute the web address to potential clients (if you're a service based business).  To create a pdf, I'd download a program called CutePDF.\nhttp://www.cutepdf.com/Products/CutePDF/writer.asp\nIt'll allow you to save it as a small file format, and most users wont be able to edit it.  You can also save your file in Word as an HTML document that is automatically ready to be uploaded to a server on the web.  If you don't have a domain name, I beleive you can get free ones at places like Yahoo! or GeoCities (like me.yahoohomepage.com, etc.).\n\nOne other thing, when you're done, I'd screen capture the .pdf (by pressing the PRTSC button on the top right hand part of the keyboard), import the picture into Paint and edit out your desktop, and save the file as a .jpg file that you can insert into emails and send out.  Hope at least some of this helps, feel free to contact me if you need help or have more questions.  Good luck!	Computers & Internet

Can a Black light be produced? If not, why? .  . I don't think so.\n\nFirst, one must look at how we see different kinds of colours.  For example, we see a blue-coloured object because the object reflects blue light into our eyes.\n\nA black-coloured object absorbed all lights falling on it and does not reflect any light.  As no light comes into our eyes from the object, it is seen to be black in colour. On this reasoning, you can't produce a black light.	Science & Mathematics

When sparring does the fighter watch the opponents eyes, shoulders or what? . In boxing, kick boxing or other martial art what does he focus on when he is sparring to anticipate a punch or kick? What should a begginer look for or concentrate on? . Old school martial arts tend to say look at the eyes but as a mixed martial artist I would always say watch the chest/shoulder area as they tend to give movement away. My old Karate instructor (even after I left Karate) was positive that the eyes were the key until he & I gave Krav-Mega a go and he was suddenly converted as by watching the eyes with a faster martial art he kept missing the punches to his head etc :)	Sports

A fish adapted to salt water must have a certain concentration of salt in the water because of osmotic pressure. \n\nThe cells of a fish don't have cell walls, just like all animal cells. \n\nIf a salt water fish is put into fresh water, too much water will rush into its cells.

How can I be a supplier to stores if I can offer merchandise, mainly garments from overseas, at a cheap price? . I have contacts with many garments factory owners who are ready to supply big orders at very competetive prices. Can someone tell me how I go about on this to find a buyer in the USA? i live in minneapolis. I will be the middle man in all these and for that do I need to register a business name or what do I have to do? Thanks for the help. . You're going to want to handle a few things here.  You've got to establish yourself legally as a distributor, which probably involves incorporating or at least setting up an LLC.  (You don't want the personal risk of a shipment going south, do you?)  \n\nSecond, you're going to want to establish distribution fulfillment (how long does it take to get things here, what choices do clients have, what terms are you willing to provide, what kind of shipping insurance, etc. are you putting together to make this a predictable process?)\n\nNext, you're going to want to establish a business presence.  The large retail organization will have buyers: professionals that choose what's going to be in a certain season or promotion's lineup.  You've got to get them the goods, interface with them, and meet their expectations.\n\nI'd recommend one general book for your process: The New Conceptual Selling.  You're going to want to manage client expectations and go through a fact-finding process with them that's going to match their win with your ability to fulfill it.  \n\nI'd also recommend that you meet one or two buyers before investing too much into the business.  You can explain your position and get an actual buyer to teach you at least a few pointers.  Once you get those pointers down, you will be well-enough grounded to actually start the conceptual sales cycle with potential clients.\n\nWhen you're finally to this point, you're going to buy a list of buyers (infousa.com is a reputable source) and prospect them in a regular, cyclical way.  Prospecting Your Way to Sales Success by Bill Good is a great approach to this.  (Kind of a cheesy book, but still the best one I've found out there.)  \n\nThis is probably a very good business for you to get into if you have reliable sources and know what they can safely deliver for you.  Be sure you are delivering what you're selling, and you'll build a business for yourself.\n\nOne alternative approach you can take is to do the same thing with designers (usually out of New York).  These guys are going to drive the biggest retail companies' buy decisions.  For these, you'd position yourself as a direct-factory resource for whatever they're designing.  They'll have exacting standards of quality, materials, textile treatments, delivery times, sizes, etc.  They'd probably be a much more steady source of revenue for you, once you establish yourself with them.\n\nGood luck!

Question for those who opposed pulling the plug on Terry Shiavo:? . I looked at the court documents and discovered that, after reviewing the evidence from BOTH sides (as scant as it was), the court found that pulling the plug would have been Terry's wish.  So my question is:\n\nDO YOU BELIEVE THAT NO ONE SHOULD EVER BE ABLE TO REQUEST WITHDRAWAL OF THEIR OWN LIFE-SUSTAINING PROCEDURES UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES? . the whole thing could have been avoided with a living will but that being said the investigation into her collapse and coma was not properly done. the fact is her husband was the only one who seemed to think she would have wanted to pull the plug, despite her strong catholic beliefs which clearly are otherwise. i find it strange that on at least two occasions he tried to 'pull the plug' and it was reinserted. the problem with this case is do you see a feeding tube as extraordinary care...now consider those who have had throat cancer, strokes, or any other condition that warrants a feeding tube. the other thing too is her family was willing to take on the financial and emotional burden of her life and he refused. why? why also did he purposely deny her own parents the right to see her before she ultimately died? i say that is cruel and considering there was no clear wish made by terry herself of her wishes it really came down to the word of her parents and her obvious religious beliefs and the word of her husband who had children with another woman and was living with her for over 10 yrs. why did he not just give full custody to her parents and family and move on with his life? one thing that out to be considered with removing the feeding tube...the husband thought that it was cruel to have her in the state she was in but removing the feeding tube and not allowing water or food is a horrendous death and not easy or peaceful. i am hopeful that the truth will come out one day and that her husband will be held accountable. he is not a nice guy and has a history of lying and cheating which leads me to believe he would no doubt lie to protect himself and lets face it, he had no love for her what he wanted was for her to die so that she couldn't ever talk and of course there is the book deal.

"what is a colonic, and how is it performed? .  . You go to the office, a tube is inserted into your lubricated rectum, warm water is sent into your colon through the tube.  Then the water is released.  This is repeated for 45 minutes to an hour.  The water loosens up encrusted fecal matter in your colon so that your body can get rid of it.\n\nIt is very important that you research whomever will treat you.  In the States the procedure is licensed as a ""cosmetic"" procedure.  Ask the therapist lots of questions.\n\nFind out how long they've been in practice, what's the average number of treatments given to their clients.  Do they provide you with dietary education throughout the process or are you left on your own to figure out what to eat?  Check out the office.  Is it clean?  Do they reuse speculum's or do they use fresh ones each time?\n\nIf their clients come in continuously for more than 2 months (max 3) at a time, or if their clients only come in once in a great while for one treatment, look for another therapist.  The goal of the treatment should be to clean you out and to strengthen your bowels to do the work more efficiently on their own.  If the therapist wants you to keep coming in for months and months and months at a time, your body will become lazy and instead of strengthening your bowels, they will become weakened.\n\nI wish you well!"

"why do we do what we do and regret it later? .  . Humans work on behaviors. They are learned and just a part of our personality. What we need to learn is that we all have what we call ""automatic thoughts"". Just use an automatic thought record. That is stop recognize the quick ""automatic thought"" that comes to you first when posed with a situation or conversation, Think about the emotion attatched to it and then think about what you are to do next. That would be the action, what you do next. By keeping a thought record of this line of thinking, over time you will learn to catch yourself before you have a regret, be it a word that was cutting or an action. I hope that this helps. What it all boils down to is ""think before you react"" and understand why you feel the way you do."	Health

I seem to turn down guyz too much, but open wit gurls, but STILL like guys....So, AM I BISEXUAL? OR LESBIAN? . If you have ever seen something called the ""Kinsey Scale,"" it describes people who are mostly attracted to one sex and somewhat attracted to the other. Judging by everything you say here, it really can't be said what, of those two labels, you are. You seem to find women more sexually attractive, but men more romantically interesting. Frankly, I think you are putting too much stock in the label. While I know it can be hard not having a set identity, you should just be with someone who you find BOTH sexually and romantically interesting and who treats you right, whether they are a man or a woman. If you really need a label for your peace of mind, I would say you are bisexual, but you are also rather young, give yourself time to figure yourself out. You already understand one point better than most. You know it is not all about sex and sexual attraction, otherwise you would have settled this question a while ago.

who won the 1994 baseball world series.? .  . Here's the full answer: The 1994 season was shortened, due to the Player's Strike. Before the strike, Major League Baseball had begun to implent the Wild Card into its playoff structure, but due to the strike, it didn't begin until 1995. The top teams in the leagues were as follows:\n\nAmerican League\nAL East: New York Yankees (70-43)\nAL Central: Chicago White Sox (67-46)\nAL West: Texas Rangers (52-62)\n\nNational League\nNL East: Montreal Expos (74-40)\nNL Central: Cincinatti Reds (66-48)\nNL West: Los Angeles Dodgers (58-56)\n\nNow there are some that will say that the Expos were robbed of a possible championship season, but one could say that of the Yankees with their record, also. Unfortunately, we'll never know...	Sports

can chlamydia be transmitted through saliva from an infected woman to an uninfected male through oral sex? .  . If the woman's infection is in her throat, then it can me transmissible via fellatio, but this is rare because chlamydia has a moderately-sized infectious dose. A certain minimum of bacteria have to move from the throat to the urethra. Biologically, men do have less ability to pick up infection as insertive partners compared to women who receive (into the pharynx or into the vagina).\n\nSo it's difficult for this to happen, but not negligible. Always use a flavored condom during fellatio.	Health

"Health question here?? Need answers? . I work on a tug boat.  I have a very unusual schedual.  My sleep paterns are very unusual at work.  I go out for 20 days and work 6hrs on and 6hrs off.  I am home for 10 days and have to adust to normal life.  I some times take xanax to help regulate my sleep so I can stay more intune with my girlfriends schedual.  I love her very much but i often feel guilty that when i'm home I turn her schedule completly upside down.  I often dont wont to go to sleep because of anxiety or maby the fact that i'm away so much i'm afraid I'm gona miss out on somthing.  I've been doing this for almost 12 years and make very good money.  I know she loves me as well.  This is very hard on both of us.  We have a great time when I'm home but It also brings alot of stress on her.  Some times I can stay up for 24 hours strait without it even phasing me. I think this is due to my job because often i have to pull these kinds of hours.  xanax helps but I'm sick of being fuzzy headed and druged.  Any good advice? . Please consider trying other things besides Xanax to help you sleep and to reduce your anxiety.  For one thing, Xanax is very addictive, and is not recommended for long term use.  For another, it's really not the most effective sleep aid, if that's how you are using it.  \n\nI have two recommendations for you and I hope you will at least look in to trying them.  I have tried both and would swear by them as they have worked wonders with both anxiety and insomnia.\n\nOne of the best things I've found that helps me go to sleep at night is a supplement called melatonin. ""At night melatonin is produced to help our bodies regulate our sleep-wake cycles. The amount of melatonin produced by our body seems to lessen as we get older. Scientists believe this may be why young people have less problem sleeping than older people.""\n\nIt has other added benefits like strengthening your immune system. You can buy it at your local health food store, a GNC, Vitamin Shoppe, or online at any vitamin store. It HELPS you get to sleep, it doesn't knock you out or anything, and it doesn't leave me with that ""sleep hangover"" you get from Nyquil.\n\nAs far as anxiety is concerned, a doctor recommended that I try taking the supplement GABA, and I have not had problems with anxiety since then. I have found that it makes me feel calmer and more in control without feeling stupid, sleepy, or drugged. I would strongly, strongly recommend that you give it a try. i have also tried valerian root and did not find it particularly beneficial, but the GABA has truly worked wonders. I have since heard from other friends who have had similar problems, and some of their doctors have also recommended they try GABA.\n\nI wish you the best of luck."	Health

"Should Americans be prepared for the return of the Draft? . Recently, I ""overheard"" that the U.S. Pentagon was formating tactics to go to war with Iran. With the decreasing number of civilians joining the American Military and rising opposition between the U.S., Iran, and Iraq, is it likely that U.S. men and women need to ""suit up"" for War? . First, the Pentagon is *always* formulating combat strategies against other countries -even our allies.  Some strategies just have more priority than others.\n\nBut besides that, Bush is not going to reinstitute the draft.  First, it would be total political suicide if he did, second, the Pentagon has explicitly said they *don't* want any drafted personnel, and third, we have a lot more personnel available for a sustained campaign against Iran (should we go to war) than is reported.  The main problem would be maintaining a force in Iran until the country's rebuilt -that's the main concern the Pentagon has when it comes to troop levels.  Of course, the Army always wants more soldiers in a location, no matter how many are there already.\n\nAlso, Charlie Rangel is a member of the House of Representatives, not the Senate.  Though it is true that he introduced the draft bill & voted against it.  But that was just a political stunt."	Politics & Government

How can gravity exist in the space ships in Star Wars? .  . Presuming you mean real space ships operating in a zero-gravity environment and not just fake spaceships on a film set?  Funkymonk is right, gentle accelleration followed by a turn-over mid trip and an equal dceleration would create a sensation of 'gravity' through the soles of the feet.\n\nAlternatively, in (say) a orbital space station, the interplay of centripetal and centrifugal forces created by spinning a structure, with its occupants, about its axis much like in the opening sequences of the film 2001, will create a sensation of gravity (tricky concept, very hard to understand ... serious maths involved) .  A large diameter structure spinning slowly would produce the best effect.\n\nMuscle wasting resulting from long periods in zero gravity is a major impediment to long space journeys, the gravity problem is one that needs to be resolved so that cosmonaughts can survive back in earth gravity once they return.

When I learned some Hebrew, I soon was able to see that the NRSV was the truest to the original language and meaning.  It is not perfect, but I found it to be the most honest in conveying the original text.\n\nI have further been convinced of this because when I began to major in religious studies in college, all of my professors always recommend the NRSV because of its accuracy.  Therefore, it wasn't just me!  It apparently really is good.\n\nI also like the New Jewish Publication Society's version. \n\nThe KJV has a magnificent poetic quality that really cannot be easily replaced.  It just sounds pleasing to the ear!  And it is often the text we have memorized as children, and so nothing else sounds right sometimes.  Psalm 23 for example, just has to be KJV if you want that poetic, beautiful style.\n\nHowever, if you want a better view into what the original may have sounded like, you may be better off with NRSV.  There is no ""Thou"" in Hebrew.  There is just ""ata.""  It didn't sound flowery to the people who used it.  It sounded more like ""you"" sounds to us.  It is not so formal.\nThis is not to say that the original Biblical languages have no poetic value.  On the contrary, they DO, and as always it is difficult to translate poetic quality into another language.  The Hebrew loves plays on words.  You usually have to read the footnotes to catch these when you are reading a translation."	Society & Culture

How do i tell my mom!?!? . I am 15 years old and i want to start using tampons. I hate pads. Ive had my period for 1 1/2 years and i think im ready. Please help me! . That is not a weird question at all.  \n\nBut I am not sure why your mom gets a vote on what sort of feminine hygiene products you use.  You don’t get a vote on what sorts of products she uses.  You are becoming an adult, and this is an adult type of situation.  Next time you are at the grocery store chuck a box into the cart, and let it go at that.  Chances are very good that she won’t say a thing about it, and if she does – ask her why she has a problem with tampons.  If you ask very loudly in the store, she will not bother you again.\n\nTampons are the ideal solution for active girls who play sports and especially swim, and even for other girls they are MUCH more comfortable than pads, they are cleaner than pads, and much more environmentally friendly than pads. \n\nTampons do not hurt, and they are not at all uncomfortable, though sometimes girls are a little bit uncomfortable with the idea of inserting them at first.\n\nOne way to get past your fear of using a tampon, is to become better acquainted with yourself.  Some time when you are not on your period, but before your next period, and when you have some time to be alone, take a few minutes to explore and see what the whole area is about.  This is something that is essential for any girl.  \n\nGet comfortable, use a hand mirror, and with your other hand spread yourself open and look around.  It is not dirty, or ugly, or wrong in any way, it is your body, you should know what it is about and how it works.  When you are comfortable, slip a finger inside a few inches.\n\nNext time you have a period, you will be ready to give a tampon a try, and will have a good idea what sort of experience to expect.  It is different, but it is not bad.  Honestly a tampon is WAY better than a pad ever was.  Don’t feel bad if you don’t get it quite right the first few times you try it – it can take a bit of practice.  Just keep trying until you get it right.  When it is right you won’t be able to feel it at all.\n\nUsing a tampon with an applicator is easier at first, but I think the OB without the applicator is easier, more comfy to put in, and much better for the environment.  You will have to pick for yourself.\n\nWhich ever one you get, follow the instructions on the box, and do not leave it in for longer than the instructions say is safe.	Health

"What can u see with a 70mm refracting scope? .  . The brilliance scale of stars is called magnitudes.  It runs backwards (a star of magnitude 1 is brighter than a star of magnitude 3).  A difference of 5 on the magnitude scale is a factor of 100x in brightness.\n\nNormally, the faintest stars we can see with the unaided eye is magnitude 6.  Some people can see 7 and (in very rare cases) 8.  In town, I feel lucky when I can get down to 4.\n\nLet's say that you can see down to magnitude 6 and that your pupil has a diameter of 7 mm (varies with age and other factors).\n\nThen a 70 mm telescope has a diameter 10 times that of your eye's pupil.  This means that the area of the telescope's objective lens is 100 times that of your pupil (area varies as the square of the diameter).\n\nThe 70 mm telescope then gathers 100 times more light than your unaided eye (and concentrates it in your eye).  Since it makes stars appear 100 times brighter, you should gain 5 steps on the magnitude scale.  In theory, if you see down to magnitude 6 with your eyes, you should see stars down to magnitude 11 with the telescope.  In practice, other factors limit the gain so maybe you'll get to magnitude 9 or 10.\n\nThe diameter also affects ""discrimination"": the ability to separate features that are very close.  Discrimination varies as the diameter, so the image seen through a 70 mm telescope should be 10 times ""crisper"" than with the eye only.  For example, some stars that appear as single with the eye, could be seen as double in the telescope."	Science & Mathematics

"How successful have office relationships been proven? . I'm in love with my boss and he's married. . You answered your own question when you said, ""and he's married.""  Honey, it just doesn't make sense.  He's your boss and he's holding all the cards.  Why do you think there are sexual harrassment laws?  Because the emotional factors will make a mess of the employment factors if you let them, and I can't imagine any good coming out of the very idea.\n\nThe problem may be your concept of ""being in love.""  Do you think this is something purely emotional, uncontrollable?  It's not.  If you decide you can't afford to love someone, that there's no realistic prospect for happiness in it, you can refuse to give in to love.  You can like, admire, admit you think he's attractive, all that; but love is something you have to be able to control, to decide.  And deciding to love your married boss is the height of stupidity, in my estimation."	Family & Relationships

the best way to lose weight? . i am 15, 5 ft 4 in, and 130 pounds. \ni want to be 115 pounds and i'll be happy. but im not obsessed about weight though. \n\ni used to be on a swim team so i'm kind of muscular. i have arm muscles and thigh/calf muslces... i know having muscles is nice, but i think mine's a little too much. \n\ni've been excercising for about 40 min each day in the fitness room... but i don't think im losing any weight. \n\ni've stopped swimming, so now there's this thin layer of fat over my abs/muscles... what should i do?\ni want to tone down my legs... RUNNING or ELLIPTICAL?\ni want to tone down my arms/get rid of the small flabs... WHAT TO DO?\n\nplease answer the above and don't worry about the diet... i'm good with that already. \n\nTHANKS!! . To lose weight, you need to run more. I would suggest running a total of 45-80 minutes a day. You also need some weight training to increase your metabolism. Since you don't wanna be muscular, i would suggest doing high reps of low weight to gain small lean muscles. I would do 20-50 reps of each exercise, and only do a couple exercises with 2 sets of each exercise.Here are some exercises I would recommend doing for someone that doesn't want to get bulky but wants to have some strength, be lean, and be fit. \n\nSquats (maximum amount you can do without weight for 2 sets)\n\n Pushups (maximum amount you can do without weight for 2 sets)\n\nBicep Curls (2 sets of 20-25 reps with 8-15lb dumbbells depending on how strong you are)\n\nShoulder Press (2 sets of 20-25 reps with 15-20lb dumbbells depending on how strong you are\n\nDoing this weight training to speed up the metabolism and running to burn the fat will help you lose weight everywhere you need to lose weight. There is no way to lose weight in just one certain area.\n\n\nI bet you are losing weight working out 40 minutes a day, but just not at a noticeable rate, so just run more and weight train to make it noticeable. \n\nGood luck\n\n\n                     Jer	Health

What kind of setup would be necessary for this idea? . I have an idea for my family (not just the family in my household either). What I would do is set up a server with an account for everyone in one location connected to the internet. From there what would the other people do to log-on with the user account that was set up for them? They might log on 20 miles or so away too, so its not just in my house, but anywhere in the world. Some people have dialup, some have DSL. Some have XP Pro and Home. . I used to have this same setup on my server.  I used a free CGI script called Profile Manager Basic (version 3.0).  When a family member wanted to sign in, I simply gave them a username and password that was the same for everyone related.  They would go to the sign in page, where the .htaccess file would grant them permissions to enter and add their contact information as well as see all other family members contact info.  Very good and extremely simple to implement.  As for the server may I suggest a few things?  First is the Abyss Server a free one from Aprelium Technolgies. http://www.aprelium.com/abyssws  Next is to visit http://www.no-ip.com and set up a free port forwarding account.  Combined you can see the results below on my site.  Vary easy to maintain connection, and extremely reliable.  You do realize that you need to have DSL or a cable connection for this all to work, right?  Good luck, and I hope this helps	Computers & Internet

"Help...I can't figure out the answer to this math problem? . Ok...\nWhat is the remainder when 5^500 is divided by 2? . The answer is 1.\nSolution:\n5^n is alway something like: 5*5*5*....*5\nand can never be perfectly divisible by 2, since none of its prime factors is 2, so you know it´s not zero. Therefor, there will always be a remainder. This remainder must be necessarily less that 2, because if it were greater than or equal to 2, then you could ""fit in another 2"" into the quotient. It can then only be 1.\n \nAs a rule, any number that cannot be perfectly divided by 2 yield a remainder of one. Think about it this way, if you have a group of people and you wanna form several pairs, either you have a perfect match or you have 1 person left, if you had another person left, you´d pair them up."

Why can't we use water as fuel (H2O)? Hydrogen and Oxygen? Both very flammable and abundant.? .  . There is one major problem. Electrolyzing the two elements (separating the H2 from O) requires more energy to separate it than it releases.  There is no cost effective way to break the bonds, currently.  The only plus about H2 for Fuel Cell cares is that it lasts longer than batteries (H2 does not die out), 1 L of compressed H2 takes you as far as 1 L of petrol, and it is clean burning.\n\nHowever, the only energy abundant enough to separate the bonds comes from coal, oil, and natural gas.  And since the 1st law of thermodynamics is correct we will be using more energy to make H2 to power our cars than we will at our homes.	Science & Mathematics

what are the differences between colonies of bacteria , yeast and moulds and how are they different? . main differences and how are they different to each other. . Yeasts and moulds are fungi - these are fundamentally different from bacteria (about as different as we are from a tree!) - if you're interested check back on what makes different kinds of cell different - eg. plants have a cell wall and animals don't. Fungi produce hyphae (a bit like plant roots) which search for nutrients - these will make the colony look furry. Bacteria are single cell micro-organisms and a colony of them (I'm assuming you're looking at an agar plate) is just a mass of clones of themselves. It will look like a circle (or in liquid suspension a sphere) because cells multiply from the point of infection out. Sometimes they can be blank in the middle where nutrients have run out in the centre so the bacteria there have died (not moved!). That's the main difference - hope that's helped a bit!

So, your cervical spine (top of back) is misaligned, thoracic (middle) spine is sprained, and lumbar is herniated.  First they do conservative methods with meds and physical therapy.  Do whatever you can before you opt for surgery.  They usually do it when the bulge finally ruptures.  The ortho companies are getting better with new products, but your spine is never the same and you usually wind up having more surgery.  I had a herniated disk at L5-S1.  My right leg went numb.  Started at the hip and eventually went down to my toes.  Could not walk or drive.  I ended up having 2 nerve blocks.  After the 2nd, I have been doing my exercises and not abusing my back.  I sit working all day and have to get up very often and ""stretch.""  I have been fine since.  \nA chiropractor usually fixes the subluxations, but if you are hurting all down your spine, that may be scary.  You either like chiropractors or you do not.

"Charles de Gaulle was a political problem for Churchill and Roosevelt  during WWII.  Please explain.? .  . Since this question asked for the political problem DURING WWII, and the rest of the group mainly spoke of AFTER WWII let me take a crack at it.  \n\nCharles de Gaulle as the leader of the ""FREE FRENCH"" sought influence in the decisions and plans regarding the future of France.  While the scared and Nazi sympathetic Vichy government practiced appeasement (boy doesn't that sound familiar)the Free French led by the self-appointed De Gaulle meddled in military plans while living in exile in England.  The political problem arises from the idea that England is trying to stave off attack and total domination of Europe by Hitler and the Nazis, and Roosevelt is trying to conquer an evil force trying to take over the world. Both do not consider France and other conquered countries to be more than Nazi strongholds now.  Counter to the production of the anti-Nazi forces, De Gaulle insists that France will reign again, outside forces will have to go through him to do any planning regarding French soil, and the allies must deliver a regained France to him as leader of the Free French who never were defeated (except that the approx 10k troups had to be lifted by boat to their new home in England.\n\nThe allies should have ignored and thrown de Gaulle out on his ear.

is advertising is affecting our youth? .  . no and neither are violent video games or any of that other crap that some poeple say are corrupting us. kids will be exposed to things sooner or later. might as well teach them while their young, so that they know what is and what isnt bad and know how to be responsable in using that knowlage. if you tell a kid that pot is bad at age 5 he's less likely to try it. tell him at age 13 and chances are he already knows about it, has tried it, and since he's actually tried it and experienced it for himself he may decide whether or not he likes it. we should expose our kids to what really goes on, not lie to them and pretend that this world is such a lovely place... when its the opposite. i would say no advertising doesnt affect our youth, atleast not in a bad way. all it does is make us want things. expose your child so he knows whats out there, and knows how to deal with it before he's on his own	Business & Finance

"Do Christian hate others  because the cross is a curse and they cross themselves to keep the curse? . The Cult of the Cross began as a Curse in 312CE after Emperor Constantine of Rome claimed he had a dream of a fiery cross in the sky with the words ""By this sign thou shalt conquer"" written below.\n\nImmediately, Constantine ordered that the monogram  of the Cross be displayed on the shields of his soldiers who were victorious in the following day's battle, which was accredited  to the Cross.\n\nIn 325CE Constantine convened and directed the First Council of Nicea in which he gave birth to the Bible and the Roman Christian Church and the Cult of the Sign of the Cross.\n\nWhy should Christians maliciously deny others their freedom of worship and expression with false reporting of breach of Community Guidelines in Religion and Spirituality on YAHOO! 7 ANSWERS.\n\nChristians feign innocence and practise discrimination and oppression with trivial and vexatious and pointless reporting in violation of Community Guidelines because of their ignorance of facts and inability to answer sensibly. . WOW, now that was actually worth a read. As a pagan I am very familiar with the truth of the treacherous Constantine understand your feelings.  I'm not sure about the cross curse, I've never heard of that before. But yes I'm sick of seeing genuine questions being answered by ""turn to god, he will save you"" and a bunch of hypocritical ranting, by fools who have no real understanding of the religion in which they have based their entire lives and judge us by.

"What does it mean if I have the urge to urinate after sex, and cant? Is there something wrong? Is this normal? . well I usual do have to urinate, so I do, but then I still feel like I have to, but I cant go and it burns. It only last a little while.  And then goes away. . It's normal especially if you don't have an orgasm.  The blood flow increases to your erogenous area and makes things feel ""swelled up"". No orgasm means no ""release"" of this built up engorgement. Also your vagina is right beneath your urethura (where the urine goes from your bladder to the outside).  The friction ""irritates"" the urethura and increases blood flow there.  All of this makes you feel increased pressure as if you need to urinate.  You MAY have a bladder infection.  This would increase all of the sensations mentioned above.  But if when you finally are able to urinate you no longer feel the pressure  it's probably not a urinary tract infection."	Health

"what is the mined geologic disposal plan? .  . When a fuel assembly has been used in a power plant, the assembly is replaced and the old one stored under water in special ponds, or in dry concrete structures or casks.  Here, shielded from people, it is allowed to cool.\n\nAfter being sufficiently cooled, the assembly, along with others, is put into a cask for temporary storage on the nuclear power plant site.  Delaying the final disposal of high-level waste also allows its radioactivity to decay.  Forty years after removal from the reactor, less than one thousandth of its initial radioactivity remains, and it is much easier to handle.\n\nThe ultimate disposal of vitrified wastes, or of spent fuel assemblies without reprocessing, requires their isolation from the environment for long periods.  The most favored method is burial in dry, stable geological formations up to 600 m or more deep.  Several countries are investigating sites that would be technically and publicly acceptable.\n\nThe U.S. considered a number of options for high-level waste disposal, and decided that mined geologic disposal offered the best option for isolation, although research on transmutation of long-lived radionuclides is continuing.  Transmutation involving neutron bombardment has the theoretical possibility of removing isotopes that are radioactive for a long time, thus alleviating disposal issues.\n\nThe plan is that the fuel will eventually be placed in the geologic deep-level repository at Yucca Mountain in Nevada.  This is a mountain of ""tuff"" -- stable volcanic rock.  This site was selected after years of investigation into other rock forms including granite, layered-salt, salt domes, and basalt.  All had advantages and all would have provided satisfactory final disposal for high level wastes.  The selection of the Yucca Mountain site in Nevada was an expeditious choice based upon the political realities of the day.\n\nThe repository deep in Yucca Mountain will consist of a large number of tunnels or corridors into which the spent fuel will be placed, in the form of fuel rods.  These rods will be sealed in heavy casks of steel, and placed in the mined caverns, which are then sealed with bentonite (a clay that forms a secure seal).  The pictures below show what the repository could look like.\n\nArtist's conception of repository underground facilities and operations\n\nArtist's conception of repository facilities\nHowever, Regulatory bodies have not yet formally approved Yucca Mountain as a high-level waste repository.  Also, Congress has not adequately funded the work, even though all necessary funds have already been collected in the Nuclear Waste Fund as a surcharge on the use of electricity (at 0.1 cent per kWh - for a total of $16 billion).  So, in the meantime, used fuel assemblies are stored temporarily at the power plants in water pools or large dry casks cooled by natural convection.\n\n\nTransuranic Waste\n\nWastes arising from weapons production in the Cold War have their own repository at the Waste Isolation Pilot Project (WIPP) in New Mexico.  This is a repository constructed in layered salt formations and it is been in operation since late 1999, accepting wastes from Government weapons production sites.  The wastes stored there are presently mainly transuranic wastes.  This waste has no connection with commercial electricity generation from the nuclear option."	Science & Mathematics
"Nip/Tuck...your thoughts on weird episode? . I'm sort of freaked out by the ""Conor McNamara 2026"" episode. Was this just a weird, horrible, stupid episode, or am I missing something? Was it a dream, or did this all really happen? Can someone else weigh in? . You are missing the fact that Joely Richardson had family difficulties during taping so they had to come up with away to send her off with what was going on in the story at the time. So a storm comes into Florida and destroys much of the area. Shawn is dreaming most of what is going on in the episode because he has just told Julia that he cheated on her. He has just told her that he had a cleff palate as a boy. He has just operated on Connor's hand and is ready to move on to hand number two. He has alot on his mind. Connor, Marlo, Christian, Matt, Julia, Anne and his father. He is afraid that many of their choices will backfire.\nOne thing to notice is they wrote in nothing about Kimber or the baby. What they wrote about is Anne having issues with her Princess party, Matt following in his fathers' footsteps, Connor thinking like Shawn that he ruined his parents' marriage, and Julia still having a relationship with Marlo even after they broke up in the last episode. In short this one long nightmare in the midst of the storm. When the storm is over, however, they are talking about having to rebuild things and that takes times. They are talking allegoically about their relationship and about the city damage.  Julia flies off to New York with the children and Shawn stays behind to clean things up in Miami. Colin Redgrave, Joely's uncle was near death with cancer and her daughter had a serious leg injury. That meant she needed time off to take care of thing."	Entertainment & Music
What do you think about this forward letter, Thaksin? . Dear friend, \nYou want to know why Khunying Photdjaman went to see Pa Prem, and what they talked about?\nKhunying had a message to be passed on the King of Thailand through Pa Prem.  The bargain of Thaksin is:\n•As for the hidden shares, he will return ten billions to Thailand and pay penalty. In return, no jail sentence. \n•As for other small technical mistakes he will pay compensation to the State, five billion baht.\n•As for causing disunity and division among the Thai people, he is very sorry. He was well meant. He will create a Foundation for Peace and Unity in Thailand with five billion baht. \n•As for having created heavy concern to the King Himself, he is extremely sorry, promise to wear the yellow shirt all his life, and ask for Royal Pardon. Besides, he will contribute to Royal Projects ten billion baht. \n•As for the Thai Rak Thai, he will dissolve it into thin air. He and his former associates will not have any role or activity in politics for five years. \n•He loves Thailand and the Thai people. He is home sick. He wants to live in peace, play golf, go shopping from time to time to Paragon and eat khuitiaw in a normal restaurant. He will do normal business, pay takes by the new rules, and visit monks. (Since his wealth has greatly diminished he will not be able to make much merit in thambuns for a few years). \n•Briefly: he pays, he gets Royal Pardon, and no jail for him. He promises to be a good boy from now on. \nThat was the message of Mr. Thaksin to Pa Prem for the King. \nKhunying Photdjaman only said she khit thing Thailand very much, was  not pleased with Harrods, and did not like English tea. Therefore she hoped to be back soon in Thailand with 100 pieces of luggage and another 100 of small shopping gifts for the new government members, to show their gratitude. \nThis simple request took only fifteen minutes. \nPa Prem did not say anything, only that he would pass the message to the King. \nEnd of the visit. . I guess this is a case of corruption and bribes, payoffs, special interests and backroom deals.  Typical politics if you ask me, aside from the cultural differences.	Politics & Government

If company A generates some data, but that data now needs to be shared with company B, as long as company A stores that data acording to the rules of XML company B can easily process the data generated from company A.....\n\nHopefully that makes sense and gives you an idead of why XML is important.

how would you promote tennis to non players? .  . Tennis is played the least among teenage girls. Why? Because they can't talk to their friends during play, like they can during basketball and soccer. Anyway, if you can get a group of non-players to start together and then get them to commit to the same time  every few days, that is a start. Have some music for them ( but not too close to the serious or seasoned players ). They can wear cool clothes, stay  or get thinner/stronger/muscle toned, and have posters of Federer, Nadal, Sharapova and Kournikova around.  You will need to give them racquets.  As for adults, again a group of beginners  ( so they aren't intimidated by better players ), maybe some hors d'oerves and wine once a week, clinics just for them. Stress the inexpensive aspects of tennis compared to other sports. Adults can start to play ANYTIME in their lives, as opposed to other sports that require a starting age during childhood.  MAKE THEM FEEL IMPORTANT. The pro as my club is so laid back that no one thinks he is serious about tennis at any level. He moves the court around from one clinic to the next confusing the newbies, arrives late, is unorganized, and does not seem grateful to these people for investing their time and money into a sport HE is supposed to making a living at and serving as an ambassador for, at the same time.  You can also try and get newbies to pro or college tennis so they can see how much fun it is and how the game is supposed to be played.	Sports

"What are some ways that a recent college graduate can use to invest? . I have just started working and instead of wasting my money buying an Ipod and other gadgets I am looking for a way ""to make my money work for me.""  Any ideas? . First, pay off all short term debt.  If you have a credit card interest rate of say, 21%, that's an instant tax-free return of 21% per year on your money.\n\nNext, if your company has a 401(k) with matching funds, fund your 401(k) to the maximum match amount.  Free money is good.\n\nIf your company doesn't have matching funds, then fund your Roth IRA to its maximum ($4,000).  Tax-free growth is good.  I'd go with a no-load, low cost mutual fund company, like Fidelity, Vanguard, or T Rowe Price.  If you have money left over after you've funded the 401(k) to the maximum match, do this step with the extra money.\n\nIf you *still* have more money for long-term investing, go back to the 401(k) and invest in that up to what you can afford.\n\nAnd get yourself an elementary education in personal finance.  You're going to get a lot advice here, and you won't know who to believe.  Well you can believe this: no one is going to care as much about your money as you are.  No one is going to watch it as closely as you are, especially someone who's got multiple accounts to look after.  So get yourself a foundation, so you'll know if someone is actually giving you good advice or not.  Personally, I recommend ""The Only Investment Guide You'll Ever Need"" by Andrew Tobias.  It'll give you an overview of everything you need to know (stocks, bonds, real estate, insurance, etc.).  Then you can decide if you need a deeper education in anything.  Good luck!"
