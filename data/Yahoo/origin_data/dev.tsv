"What is the significance of the title ""Speak"" written by Laurie Halse Anderson? .  . In the summer before her freshman year of high school, Melinda Sordino is raped at a party by a popular senior, Andy Evans. Melinda calls the police and they bust the party, but she does not report the rape. When those attending the party find out that it was Melinda who called the police, they refuse to speak to her and Melinda begins her freshman year as an outcast. Melinda's art teacher, Mr. Freeman, asks his students to focus on one randomly chosen topic and make it ""say something"" by the end of the year. Melinda is assigned the subject ""tree.""\n\nOver the course of the year, Melinda works to regain some confidence and regain her former friendships. The development of her tree artwork mirrors her gradual regrowth. When one of her former friends, Rachel, begins dating Andy Evans, Melinda works up the courage to begin telling her story, if only in fragments. At the close of the novel, Andy confronts her, but this time Melinda finds the strength to defy him. ""I *SAID* NO!"" she yells, and this is a major turnaround point for her, as one of the issues factoring into her silence and self-blame was that she was in shock, and couldn't say no."

"Just wondering if anyone knows!  Why are Cartoons called Cartoons.? . Been wondering for ages. . In its original meaning, a cartoon (from the Italian cartone, meaning ""big paper"") is a full-size drawing made on paper as a study for a further artwork, such as a painting or tapestry. \n\nCartoons were typically used in the production of frescoes, paintings made onto wet plaster over a series of days. You had to use a paint made from egg and pigment (tempera) which was sucked into the wet plaster as it dried, but the plaster dried very fast, so each panel was only about a meter square. \n\nto plan the whole design, the picture would be drawn in line only, a cartoon, and then the lines would have pinpricks where the outline of the design has been picked out in the plaster. this was done with carbon dust (charcoal dust) brushed through the pin pricks to leave feint dots on the wet plaster, to guide the painted lines.\n\nCartoons by painters such as Raphael and Leonardo da Vinci are highly prized in their own right. The comic books of the 1920's, with the pictures drawn in a thick black line, looked like these old pictures, and were called cartoons. \n\nThe difference between a cartoon and animation, is that the latter has not got a thick edge to simplify the drawing, and is a series of little paintings."

"Does it scary you that Generation-X'ers are going to eventually be taking over? . It scares the HELL out of me.  Generation X'ers in Congress, Senator and EVENTUALLY the presidency. . Okay, so they're college professors who are teaching the future leaders. I don't think that you can really find any generation without things to complain about. It may shock you to know that not all of us gen x or y or whatever category I fall into are what you see on MTV, fully obsessed with the bling-bling ""real world"" jessica&nick fantasy life of hollywood. We're not all grungy potheads with no ambition in life either. Some of us made it out of the mess and have a concern for the well being of the rest of the world and CAN see outside of our own front yard to how our actions affect the rest of the world. What scares me about the future is the corporations who don't give a damn about anything but profit and exist to worship and glorify the almighty dollar at the expense of variety of life itself. And the sad part goes back to your original statement. People in my generation don't give a damn. About much of anything. So the corporations take over and tell us what to wear, listen to, watch, eat, drink and do or risk being yesterday's news and people buy into that crap. That is what scares me. Apathy."

how to disable the Back and Refresh buttons of the browser in an ASP web application? . I basically want the users not to use browser's back button by either disabling it or by giving a message . This was asked in an earlier question.  But the basic answer is, you can't (and you definitely can't do it with a server side script like ASP).  Even if you could, you still have other ways that the user can navigate back into the middle of a session.  There are the forward/back options in the context menu (right click on a page), there is the browswer history, the user can simply enter an explicit url.\n\nSo bottom line is you can't do it and even if you could you need to make your web app robust enough to handle users plopping themselves in the middle of defunct sessions and/or repeating actions.

Is it tacky for a guy to ask a woman that he just met for money and he has'nt even taken her out yet ? . OK I met a guy about 2months ago we went out to the movies and dinner , he paid for the 20$ movie tickets; I paid for dinner & drinks you figure the bigger bill. then saw each other 4more times but in my car and by my house I paid for brunch and gas etc. then yesterday he asked me for cash. I felt bad because I really didnt have it but I think he was out of line to even suggest it ; I dont want to sound like a bird but I like him of course however not enough to stand for crap , I still believe a man should be a man and pay for the first few dates . After a relationship is established Im more than happy to help out every once and again NOT just give , give ,give  what do you think I should do ?? everyone already says I give up on men 2 soon. p.s I am attractive ;I have alot of guys that would never ask me to even look in my purse but I just like this guy because, I guess he has charm in other places lol. . Guys like this are professionals, P.I.M.P's and they prey on women that are established as having it going on, meaning own stable living quarters, job, money car etc. He just needed time to fill you out see what you were willing to give. 9 times out of ten he already has a girl and if not he is looking for someone that is willing to pay to play , don't let that be you.

What will be the nature of public policy formulation and implementation in the rapidly gobalizing world.? .  . Global power infrastructures will become increasingly important for problem solving because local governments (even national governments) will be incapable of meeting challenges which transcend national borders.\n\nThe most democratic choice for a global governing institution is, of course, the UN. That institution has fallen out of favor with industrialized countries, however, because the general assembly is essentially dominated by the third world.\n\nInstead, global power will likely continue to manifest itself through the ever-growing economic reach of the G8 and (increasingly) the PRC. These countries will likely continue to hold the preponderance of global power, and will formulate and implement global policy by consensus when possible. When consensus is impossible, they will act unilateralely in their respective spheres of influence.	Politics & Government

any legal buffs out there regarding texas law? .  . I tend to reckon that there are quite a number of us concerned with our laws and there implementations here in Texas and elsewhere.\nBelow you may find comfort in a 'mock report' that I presented for a particualr case in Criminal Justice class.  Jose\n\nReady? Wanna see it? Well, here goes.\n\nGarza 1\nExam III\n\nA review of a police officerâs summary report; âThe Case of Samuel Young (13) and Maria Kincaid (10), Chapel Hill, Texasâ: Texas v Samuel Young/Statutory Rape/Indecency with a Child; George Young and Theresa Young: Child Abuse/Child Neglect and Contributing to the Corruption of a Minor, respectively; examIIIstoughcriminallaw, Garza, Jose M.; Student/Observer/Analyst 2004\n\nA SUMMARY REPORT TO THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY\nWhile responding to a service call (Disturbance) at the Twin Oaks Subdivision in North Chapel Hill, Texas, Officer Ima Shortee (responding officer), within the proximity of said disturbance and other unreported activity did then and there witness the sexual misconduct of two minors, and proceeded to arrest the13-year-old child; mainly Samuel Young on the charge of Statutory Rape and Indecency With a Child, after having seen and heard the 13 year old child display his genitalia to 10 year-old Maria Kincaid, and by aggravating the conduct by âthreat of toneâ so that 10 year-old Maria was coerced into raising her skirt, lowering her undergarments and thereby laying bare her own genitalia.\n\nPurpose:\nTo support, reject or clarify the charges applied to or by the actors according to the Texas Criminal Law and Rules for Criminal Procedure.\n\n\nParticipants:\nTelephone Caller-----------Disturbance Reporter\nOfficer Ima Shortee--------Responding/Arresting Officer\nMaria Kincaid (10)---------Victim\nSamuel Young (13)---------Arrestee\nGeorge Young (33)---------Father of Samuel Young\nTheresa Young (21)--------Mother of Samuel Young\n\nRules in support of argument of minors:\nThe evidence of extraneous offenses or acts under article 38 and 37,of the Texas Penal Code offers no defense against the prosecution that includes Sexual Offenses, Assaultive Offenses, Prohibited Sexual Conduct and the Sexual Performance by a Child.  And therefore Samuel Young 13 is prosecutable for his Sexual Misconduct (Sexual Assault and Indecency with a Child). The rules for Criminal Procedure for the State of Texas are satisfied by a lawful and legally applicapable process applied by the arresting officer, Ima Shortee of the North Chapel Hill police Department. In support of this observation it is essential to abide by Constitutional Due Process Law .  According to the report entry into the residence was not necessary since the perpetrator and the victim were in all probability outdoors (the officer saw and heard) and therefore leaving/baring this event applicable under the Plain View Doctrine , under the Texas Criminal Rules of Procedure.\n\n\nRules in support for argument against parents:\nAccording to the âFamily Code-Subtitle B-Chapter 41-Liability of Parents for Conduct of Childâ  the parents of minor child Samuel Young (13); Mainly George Young (33) and Theresa Young (21) are criminally liable and prosecutable for the sexual conduct of their child.\n\nOpinion:\nIt is the opinion of this author that both parents are in non-compliance with the Texas Family Code and are therefore liable and prosecutable for the charges of Child Neglect, Child Abuse and Gross Negligence under section Â§ 41.001.  LIABILITY (Parental) and that Samuel Young is in non-compliance with the rules of Sexual Conduct of the State of Texas; Article 38.37;Evidence of extraneous offenses or acts, Section 1.\nOfficer Ima Shortee and the arrest of a child without warrant stands, for the Actus Rhea was in the plain view of the responding officer to the disturbance call and Due Process was not violated neither under the 4th Amendment nor the 14th Amendment and is further valid lawful and legal action by the following Article 14.05 [216] [263] [	Politics & Government

That is crazy. I work in real estate and I can not tell you how frustrating it is to have to explain something about a LOAN to a LOAN officer. I know it's not your fault, but it would help you do your job better if you understood some of the basics about the lending industry. I think you should talk to your boss, and see if they will begin taking time to teach you things little by little. I think that your boss will be happy that you are interested in being better at your job. If that doesn't work, try to educate yourself by watching and listening as much as you can and reading about your companies various loan programs, etc.\nI think it's great that you care. Most people don't, and it's not fair to the clients or to the other businesses you work with.\nGood Luck!	Business & Finance

(duh i know that). but im looking for specific instructions, mabey a good plan. o yeah include ab toning stuff an burnig belly fat . hi :) am not sure whats available in the markets...but, this is what i did to lose weight... PLEASE DONT TAKE PILLS... pills are nothing but anorectic agents... they make you feel less hungry... there is no way to loose weight fast... though , sauna , steam and massages help slightly... it has to be combined with diet and excercise... pills are very bad in the long run... can lead to impotency and infertility...\n\nAlso... short term diets are no good because , they terribly pull down your body metabolism rate since you dont eat much during that period ... Because of this , once you break your diet , you'll start putting on more weight, the reduced body metabolism will take longer and slower to burn the food you take in...\n\nThey also dont work because once you break your diet and start eating normally, you will get back to your normal weight as you might not be cautious as to how many cals you take in per day...\n\n\ni lost 10 kgs in about 5 months time... i am getting married in august and i desperately needed to loose weight... i was 65 kilos when i started... according to my BMI , i was 10kgs + overweight... i stand 5'2.odd and 65 kilos is grossly overweight...\n\njust dieting wont help like i found out in my case... diet + exercise will do the trick...\n\ni'll tell you what i did... it worked for me... hope it works for you too :)\n\nthe trick is not to starve but to eat smart :) and stay healthy :)\n\nwhat you should cut down :\noil , butter , cheese , margarine , mayonisse , sauces (depends , will get back to that a bit later), chips , crisps, nuts , chocolates , sugar , cola, fizz , areated drinks ,ice creams , chocolate , alcohol , cakes and everything else thats hi - cal... you'll need to avoid everything thats sweet , oily and sticky... if you are not sure about what foods to avoid... check the net...loads of info available...\n\nvegetables / meat to avoid :\npotatoes - very very important , beetroot (its a root and has concenterated sugar in it) , all kinds of roots basically except carrot... avoid lamb, mutton , pork , beef, and prawns... all these put on weight... eat only lean meats... thats fish and chicken.. avoid eating egg yolk... eat just the egg white...\n\nfruits to avoid :\nmangoes , bananas , jackfruit\n\n\nnow that we had a look at what foodstuff is to be avoided...you might be wondering if there is anythig at all that you can eat... thats how i felt... there is loads of stuff you can eat actually :)\n\nhere they come :)\n\nfast foods are a big no no... you can order salads and special lo cal foods that are avaailable in most outlets...\n\nits best to eat at home for the period you are dieting and trying to lose weight...after those few months... once you've shed your load...you can get back to your usual lifestyle... of course with some caution...\n\n\nmy diet...\nbreakfast:\n\nskimmed milk (use skimmmed milk , is low in fat , other typer of milk are higher in fat content) , fruit... i am from India... am not sure where you are from and hence you might not understand certain food types we consume here... but let me tell you something... Indian food is very very oily and very difficult to diet...\n\nand try cereal in the mornings... oats, weetabix... etc... have a good breakfast...alwaays use brown bread... whole wheat brown bread is very good for weight reduction...\n\n\nfor lunch , we are staple rice eaters... rice is bad for fat reduction... but i still took rice because its a habit tht cant be changed... everyone takes rice here... so... rice - one cup - 100gms and lots of veggies cooked in less oil.. and absolutely no coconut and curry with less oil... all in all keep your oil intake to 2 tea spoons everyday... that would be just for seasoning... also using olive oil helps a lot...\n\n\nthen for dinner... compulsarily have wheat... pasta is a good option...but make sure you buy wheat pasta... check before buying... and of course in pasta absolutely no sauces... some varities o"	Health

Careful handwashing is the most effective tool in preventing MRSA infections, and you should warn any visitors you have in your home that you have this infection present so they may take precautions. If any of the family is children precautions should be taken for contact especially in GYM class. We have had a outbreak of MRSA skin infection here in locker rooms. At home: Keep your hands clean by washing thoroughly with soap and water or using an alcohol-based hand sanitizer. \nKeep cuts and scrapes clean and covered with a bandage until healed. \nAvoid contact with other peopleâs wounds or bandages. \nAvoid sharing personal items such as towels or razors.

Well my grandpa has been staying with us a couple days now and grandma came up to be with him.  Well, I went in the nursery to change my baby's diapers, feed him and then play with him some.  I have a stuffed baby Smurf that my husband gave to me that used to belong to his first wife that is so cute!!!  After I fed the baby I picked it up and started pretending it was real and pretending that it was talking to my baby (I was doing the voices..teehee).  I said stuff like ""I love you so much"" and ""you are so precious"" and things like that and the baby just was giggling.  Well my grandmother came in and told me my behavior was very unbecoming of a young lady and after I left the room she took it and locked it in her car trunk.  I pleaded with her to give it back but she won't because she says it is making me childish.  To me it was just something I enjoyed doing with my baby and it made him laugh when I would wiggle the smurf.  I also cuddle with him some nights when I'm sleeping. .

I want to study inJapan free of charge. Have I chance? .  . Japan would love to have you!  If you're in college, see your study abroad office for home-stay and study abroad opportunities.  Most are the same cost a semester's tuition, though there are scholarships you can apply for.  If you've already graduated, look into teaching positions (like the JET Program) so you can study in Japan during your free (non-teaching) time.  I live here, teach English, study Japanese when I can...and love it!  Good luck!	Education & Reference

"Do countries have a natural right to nuclear bombs? . A few super leftist wackos my assert this but most people, left or right, agree that there is no ""right"" to nuclear bombs.\n\nSo, if we agree there is no ""right"" then what is to be done in terms of the reaction from the international community? No action is de facto endorsement of the right and any future condemnation of new nuclear states would be worthless.\n\nDONT CONFUSE THIS INQUIRY WITH THE SEPARATE ISSUE OF WHETHER CHINA OR AMERICA ""SHOULD"" HAVE THEM. If you start going the ""Russia has em, America has em"" route your stupid. I am not endorsing anyones possession of them and if I could be sure that no one else could have them, given the power, i would fully dismantle and rid America of the bomb.\n\nThis QUESTION DEALS WITH MORE NUKES. CAN WE AGREE LESS NUKES ARE BETTER? IF WE CAN, THEN WE DONT WANT NEW PLAYERS TO GET NEW NUKES AND THEREBY INCREASING PROBABLITIES OF NUCLEAR EXCHANGES. \n\nIf China adds another nuke, thats not good, but the probablity of nuclear war is no greater. . Look the thing that binds nuclear disarmament internationally is the Non-proliferation Treaty.  It's an agreement that allows for countries (even Iran) to engage in peaceful nuclear research for the purposes of nuclear power among other things.  It is also widely violated by Israel and by India (which was basically told in an agreement with the US that it could build as many nukes as it wanted).  \n\nNow, I'll give you the no country has the right to a nuke, but then the question goes to any nation seeking the bomb, ""By what right can the US decide that India can build nukes but we cannot?""  And I'm not necessarily talking about Iran here.  Pakistan is pissed that India gets access to US nuclear technology but IT DOESN'T.  \n\nAnother problem is that once a country gets the bomb, like say North Korea, the US stops its Sabre rattling.  Iraq had to be invaded because Saddam could have been working on the bomb say the talking heads.  Well North Korea (hardly an improvement IMHO) did get the bomb and what happened?  Talks.  That sends a strong message to many a regime unfriendly to the US I think.  \n\nAs for if China adds another nuke, well, you really don't understand much about China's nuclear program.  They don't really have many nukes and have no real second strike capability, but if they were to turn their burgeoning economy and pour it into their nuclear inventory, and developed a second strike capability, they would be a much more serious threat to the US."

Front Side Bus\n\nIn computers, the front side bus (FSB) or system bus is a term for the physical bi-directional data bus that carries all electronic signal information between the central processing unit (CPU) and other devices within the system such as random access memory (RAM), AGP video cards, PCI expansion cards, hard disks, the memory containing the system BIOS, etc.	Computers & Internet
"What is the legal definition of slander? . I live in Colorado.  Anything which might apply to religion and media sources are helpful things. . slanÂ·der (slÄn'dÉr) \nn.\nLaw. Oral communication of false statements injurious to a person's reputation.\nA false and malicious statement or report about someone.\n\nv., -dered, -derÂ·ing, -ders.\n\nv.tr.\nTo utter a slander about. See synonyms at malign.\n\nv.intr.\nTo utter or spread slander.\n( http://www.answers.com/slander&r=67 )\n\nSlander and libel\nFrom Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\n(Redirected from Libel)\nJump to: navigation, search\n""Libel"" redirects here; for other uses, see Libel (disambiguation). For ""liable"", see Liability.In English and American law, and systems based on them, libel and slander are two forms of defamation (or defamation of character), which is the tort or delict of publishing (meaning to a third party) a false statement that negatively affects someone's reputation. ""Defamation"" is the term generally used internationally, and is accordingly used in this article where it is not necessary to distinguish between ""libel"" and ""slander"".\n\nVocabulary and general concepts\n\nOrigin of the word libel\nfrom Latin libellus ""little book""\n\n\nLibel and Slander terminology\n\nExcuses\nEven if a statement is derogatory, there are circumstances in which such statements are permissible in law.\n\n\nTruth\nIn many, though not all, legal systems, statements presented as fact must be false to be defamatory. Proving to be true is often the best defense against a prosecution for libel. Statements of opinion which cannot be proven true or false will likely need to apply some other kind of defense.\n\nIn some systems, however, truth alone is not a defense. It is also necessary in these cases to show that there is a well founded public interest in the specific information being widely known, and this may be the case even for public figures.\n\n\nPrivilege and Malice\nAlmost all legal systems, including those of the United States, Scotland, and England and Wales, require in some situations that the subject of the communication prove, in a civil court, that the defendant made the statement with ""malice"", meaning either believing it was false or with ""reckless disregard"" for whether it was false. This is known as ""qualified privilege""; a typical example is a complaint of professional misconduct. ""Absolute privilege"" has the effect that a statement cannot be sued on as defamatory, even if it was made maliciously; a typical example is evidence given by a witness on oath (although this may give rise to different claims, such as an action for malicious prosecution) or statements made in a session of the legislature.\n\n\nSimilar but different delicts and torts\nSome jurisdictions have a separate tort or delict of ""verbal injury"" or ""convicium"" involving the making of a statement, even if truthful, designed to harm the claimant out of malice; some have a separate tort or delict of ""invasion of privacy"" in which the making of a true statement may give rise to liability: but neither of these comes under the general heading of ""defamation"". Some jurisdictions also have the tort of ""false light"", in which a statement may be technically true, but so misleading as to be defamatory. There is also, in almost all jurisdictions, a tort or delict of ""misrepresentation"", involving the making of a statement which is untrue even though not defamatory; thus if a surveyor states that a house is free from the risk of flooding, he or she has not defamed anyone, but may still be liable to someone who purchases the house in reliance on this statement.\n\n\nCriminal libel\nMany nations have criminal penalties for defamation in some situations, and different conditions for determining whether an offense has occurred. Thus, for example, in Zimbabwe ""insulting the President"" is by statute (Public Order and Security Act 2001) a criminal offence. In European syste"	Politics & Government

Does anyone listen to punk anymore? . Punk was never popular, and it wasn't supposed to be, but it seems like there are less and less real punks out there nowadays. Are there any punks here? (and I mean real punks, not Simple Plan/Good Charlotte/Avril Lavigne fans) . I think punk is going back underground. The history of punk is cyclical. It sort of broods underground for a while, then bursts into the mainstream, where it inevitably gets assimilated, labeled, and spawns a thousand crap pseudo-punk bands. Then it disappears for a while, only to re-emerge as a backlash to whatever took its place. \n\nAnd a side note to Getta - never say that punk was popular after 79. Punk died in 77 when the Sex Pistols broke up. Everything after that (From 78-84) is labeled post-punk and is what spawned new wave, no wave, etc.	Entertainment & Music

"Where is God? .  . God is everywhere, from the first rays of sun in the morning to the last hint of the stars in the night.  He is in my son when he is laughing and smiling to see me walking up the driveway at the end of the day.\n\nI used to wonder the same thing when I was much younger than I am now.  Where is God when there are so many people starving to death?  Where is God when people kill each other over a pair of tennis shoes?  Where is God when babies are born with birth defects and are not allowed to live for even a day?\n\nI learned, somewhere along the line, that God doesn't kill those people, but rather gives us, His creation, the opportunity to help those who need it.  If He were to come out and say ""do this"" then he would be taking away our most precious gift, the one thing that makes us different than the animals, free will.\n\nRather, He gives us the situation and then tells us we have a choice, you can either do something, or do nothing, it is up to us to decide how we are supposed to act.  Is this a situation that we pitch in and help? or is this the part where we sit out?\n\nSome one once said that we should always do the right thing, because the only Jesus some people will ever see, is the Jesus inside me.  I choose to do what I can, when I can, to help those that can not do for themselves.  It is, sadly, not enough.  \n\nI can not write the huge check that will feed everyone for even a single meal.  I can volunteer my time to help those who help others, which is what I do.  I spend about 30 hours a week creating web sites and print material for a number of non-profit organizations that help the underprivelidged.  It isn't much, but it is what I can do.\n\nSo, I guess then that to answer your question ""where is God?"" I would direct you to your bedroom, and have you look in the mirror, God should be the person looking back at you.\n\n+David"	Society & Culture

If you could make your own All-Star roster for either side, who would start, and who would be on your bench? . I don't think the AL starting lineup is fair. Stupid fan voting... .

Wright: his catch early season was sick...and he can hit.\nOF #1: Berkman\nOF#2: Beltran\nOF#3: Carlos Lee\nNL (2nd teamers)\nC: David Ross: 100 less AB's to McCann better numbers in everything except AVG.\n1B: Nomar\n2B: Dan Uggla\nSS: Freddy Sanchez\n3B: Miguel Cabrera: big numbers, small amount of protection in that lineup.\nOF#1: Andruw Jones\nOF#2: Soriano\nOF#3: Dunn: This is only because I really wanted to see him in the homerun derby. Holliday deserves it.\n\nSP: Brandon Webb\n\nAL starters: \n\nC: Mauer\n1B: Ortiz (Playing in NL park)\n2B: Least deserving all star postion on both leagues. I'll take Jose Lopez.\nSS: Tejada\n3B: A-Rod\nOF#1: Dye\nOF#2: Wells\nOF#3: Ramirez\n\nSP: Liriano: He has 1/2 the amount of starts as other pitcher and all of his numbers are top 10 or better. Plus if you're on the AL team and you have a shot at World Series Home field advantage do you really want Rogers 3.65+ ERA on the mound? Most of the NL has hit off of him several times. Liriano hasn't faced but a few of the NL hitters and most of them have seen him less than 5 times.\nAL Second stringers\nC: Ramon Hernandez: 15HR 61RBI--how many catchers have ever put up these numbers before all-star break?\n1B: Haffner or Thome? Gotta go Thome because of teams overall record.\n2B: Brian Roberts: if it was up to me Lopez would be my only true 2B.\nSS: Jeter: Glue that has held that team together after all of their injuries\n3B: Crede: I would take similiar RBI's and better defense compared to Glaus.\nOF#1: Crawford: I love extremely fast guys who hit for power and high average\nOF#2: Rios\nOF#3: Vlad: His defense puts him over Mags\n\n*****If the fans (including myself) continue to vote Paul laaaaaduca into the all-star game I say fans should wave their right to decide the starters.

is it possible for an object to obtain a larger impulse from a smaller force than it does from a larger force? .  . Impulse is the integral of force over time, so applying half the force over more than twice the time is greater impulse.  It's not a very useful quantity unless you add some conditions, like all of the force is used to increase the object's momentum in the direction of the force.  You could apply a large force for years to a tree and never increase its momentum.	Science & Mathematics

It depends on the level of your anxiety and your PCP's comfort level in treating it.  Many PCP's would be comfortable treating mild to moderate anxiety with a medication like Paxil or Celexa.  These will likely help with some of the anxiety symptoms, but will not get to the root of the anxiety.  There may be a role at some point for some psychological counseling to address the underlying cause of the anxiety and how to treat it without lifelone medications.	Health

Is it possible for a Cuban Tree Frog to climb through plumbing to gain entry to my bathroom? . Because one showed up in the middle of the night and scared the life out of me! .

I started Atkins a week ago and at first I was seeing dramatic results.  I lost a lb a day the first 4 days... . however, after that I began to put it back on.  They say the average person loses 6-8 lbs the first 2wks.  What is wrong with me that I am struggling on this diet?? I used to have the best metabolism ever and now I am stuck at a certain number.  I am only 24.  I excercize atleast 5 times a week as well. . First, drop the Atkins diet.  As a nutritionist, I can tell you that ANY diet that limits ANY food group is not going to help you lose or maintain a healthy weight.  What I tell most people is that large weight loss that you experienced during the initiation period of the diet was not weight loss but water loss.  You might have felt a bit tired.  A bit slugish or fuller than you normally do when you eat.  Its a long drawn out explaination but the short of it is, the longer you stay on the diet the more damage you do to your organs.  With that said, lets look at what you are eating and what type of exercise you are doing.  When you work out, can you hold a conversation with the person next to you?  Could you belt out the words to the song you are listening to on your walkman or ipod?  If so...you're not working hard enough.  You should be able to utter two or three words at the most.  BUT on the other hand you shouldn't be gasping for air either.  You should be pushing yourself hard enough that if you were asked to push a bit harder you could do it.  Are you lifting weights?  Muscle (which helps to burn more calories due to the fact it takes more to maintain it) building exercises are GREAT for weight loss. and no (if you are female) you wont become the next Ms. Olympian, and if you are male...its gonna take a lot more than a couple of times a week to get the bulk that will make you the next Arnold. \n\nDo you feel that if you work out at the gym *(hopefully for 60 minutes at least 3 times a week) you could have a treat to reward yourself for a job well done?  You have to do this and I guarantee that the weight will begin to fall off. \n\nAsk yourself how long it took you to gain the weight that you are now at, and realize that is the time it will take to lose the weight.\n\nRe-evaluate your portion and see if they are distorted.  Start to read the labels of the food you eat and try to eat the serving size. \n\nTry to stay as close to the source as possible.  Eat fresh, it natural, it whole grains. \n\nlift weights 2-3 times a week. cardio 3-5 times a week and try to add or push a little harder every 2 weeks.  \n\nThrow the scale out the window.  If you begin to lift weights the added muscle weights more than the fat you are so disgusted with.  As someone who has lost over 135lbs over the last 10 years and kept it off.  I can tell you that it took me 5 years to lose that weight just like it took me 5 years to gain it.  I work out 6 days a week, I lift weights 3 times a week and I do everything from running, kickboxing, salsa dancing, power sculpting, step aerobics and swimming.  All because I want to insure that I get a well rounded workout for my entire body.  Find a workout that fits you.  If its belly dancing so be it.  If its step or some other group exercise.  You may find (much like I did) that things are so much more fun and less daunting when you have a partner or a group. \n\nGood luck and realize that if weightloss was so simple and easy,  nobody would be over weight.

Why are Americans becoming so fat and lazy? .  . How dare you say we are becoming fat and lazy, we are weight challenged and exercise deficient.  We are a healthy country, excuse me while I open my cheetos, we eat right, have the best resturants (McDonalds, Dennys, Burger King, Taco Bell, Del Taco, the snack bar in Walmart) where else can you get the nutrious and lip smacking meals like they present, only in America.  Do you (of course you don't) remember the day when you had to get out of your chair to change the television channel?  Lock your car door with a key?  Get out of your car and walk into the resturant to get your food, cash your check, buy your liquor, get married, get divorced, go to church.  Did you ever walk to work, ride a bike, take the bus?  Do you have a car and drive to work by yourself, letting this 2000 pound vehicle take your 150 pound body around, how efficient is that???

Why is the sky blue and the grass green and the sun yellow? .  . using simple physics\n\nThe blue color of the sky is due to Rayleigh scattering. As light moves through the atmosphere, most of the longer wavelengths pass straight through. Little of the red, orange and yellow light is affected by the air.\n\nthe grass is green because the other colors are absorbed and only green is reflected. Grass and most other plants are green because they contain a pigment known as chlorophyll.\n\nSun isn't really yellow. The color yellow is a purely human interpretation of a collection of radiation that hits the retinae of our eyes and gets processed by our visual cortex.	Education & Reference

"why do so many people use the straight but not narrow answer? . i dont really get why people that claim to be okay with the sexuality of themselves and others need to put the fact that they are socialy acceptable on a button. its kind of like ""i have friends that are are gay, but dont worry I'M not"". . I think part of it may be to keep others from questioning their sexuality--in other words, it's their own insecurity about how others perceive them. To me it seems that heterosexual men are very concerned that they not be seen as gay, even by accident. Because two women together is often more accepted by heterosexual society (a popular heterosexual male fantasy), I think you won't hear women say this as often. Also, I think women are generally more gay tolerant. Perhaps that's another reason they don't feel the need to separate themselves verbally by the ""I'm not"" tag."	Society & Culture
"Do you support the very relaxed laws of the  right to possess firearms in the USA? . I am not aying a totla ban, but a more stict enforcement of who should possess guns and under what circumstances, or we will become a trigger happy nation.\n\nEspecially with so many youngsters who finally land up with guns in school? I know those who possess will say it is their constitutional right, but before you do so, please think for a moment. \n\nNo where else in the world, do people have such relaxed laws to possess firearms, and yet the percentage of such people who may be mugged or attacked, is not high. . While the Senond Amendment to the U.S. Constitution states that it's legal to have weapons, it DOESN'T mean that everybody is entitled to them, no matter what.\n\nSecond Amendment:\n\n""A well regulated militia, being necessary to the security of a free state, the right of the people to keep and bear arms, shall not be infringed.""\n\nWeapons were MEANT to be used for situations where one's life is at stake, NOT for some guy to use while holding up a convience store.\n\nThey should have a crackdown.  In addition to ex-felons not being able to possess them, MORONS should also not be allowed to use them.\n\nHere's an idea:  Any American who cannot say & spell ""I am in the possession of a legal firearm"" shoiuld NOT be allowed to own one.  I would say that all non-U.S. citizens should not be allowed to possess one, but it's us, the legal ones, who do much of the killing.\n\nWe can crack down without infrinnging on other's rights.

I was arrested,  - then released.  Now? . How come I cant get my ID, my purse, or anything back? I know I cant get illeagle stuff back... But what right do they have to keep my ID, credit cards, etc? . It depends on why and where you were arrested.\n\nWithout that information, nobody can tell you exactly why those things have not been returned to you.  It's possible they will be used as evidence but, again, you didn't supply enough information for anyone to speculate as to that.\n\nIf you have asked for that property to be returned, and they have refused, did you ask why they were refusing?  If you didn't, then you really need to call them back and ask that question.  If you are not satisfied with the answer, then you can always ask to speak with a supervisor for some clarification.  \n\nBut really - nobody here will absolutely have a 100% positive answer because nobody here knows all the circumstances.  Call the agency holding your property and ask them your question.	Politics & Government
Does anyone know of any programs to help ex-convicts gain employment when they leave prison? . Iâd prefer programs in Maryland or Virginia, but Iâll take any advice you can give me. . Everybody makes mistakes and some pay for it by going to prison.  It makes me sick to think that the private sector will not make the effort necessary to try hard to match a job to someone who has  been in prison.  It would appear that this will follow you unless you are one of the lucky ones and find a decent company out there that can assist you.  Right now, there are thousands of people with poor credit records that cannot even get a job because they are deemed irresponsible, etc. and this simply is not the case.  Most had a run of bad luck financially and they too, like you, will continue to pay the price.  But please don't try to ask the government for help as they can't even help themselves right now.  You should be gaged on your work knowledge and talents and also what the offense was that you served time for and in that event, work towards finding an employer that can accept it.  I personally would like to start a program myself to help individuals like yourself, if deserving, and I am sure you are.

"Do you think certain questions on this sight are specifically asked  to find out where public opinion lies? . If you do, do you fear there could be some sort of retaliation for voicing your opinions? (Constitutional rights not withstanding) From where? and why? . Yes, several people have asked questions to get public opinion.\nYes, sometimes there is some form of retaliation against various opinions.  Usually, however, it is the exact same thing I do.  I ask a question to get an idea of what people think and then, if I really don't like someone's answer, I chew them out for being an idiot.\n\nI would imagine that would be the extent of most ""retaliation.""\n\nIn a few cases, there are federal agents posing as children or dealers trying to get information on criminals to arrest.  That, however, is more than just ""retaliation for voicing"" opinions, but collecting evidence of crime.\n\nIn some rare cases, since I've noticed that (supposedly) Tom Cruise was on this site, that there may likewise be people in positions of power that might be tempermental and abuse their positions of power vindictively against people whose answers or questions they didn't like.  Conspiracy?  No.  Childish behavior?  Anyone for a cigar with the intern?  Let's not be naive.  It can happen.\n\nGetting a real feel for real public opions here?\nIt's not a great site for that.  I've seen survey sites that have this down to an art.  Sure, someone might try to be a cheapskate and avoid paying a survey company their fees, but if you look at how many sarcastic and joke responses I've seen here, I'd have to say that this isn't the most reliable site for honest opinions.  That makes being vindictive all the more childish and any potential conspiracy so much more of a waste of time.\n\nMy guess would be, if you have a real plan for acts of terrorism and are sharing it online, you will upset someone and that someone will report you and that reporting will result in some action from the government.  Someone that's just angry though... Hell, we have LOTS of those.\n\nI notice that most questions here appear to be to and from Americans.  I've seen a few questions about India and a few other countries, but mostly the USA.\n\nCertain cites censored themselves in China.  Could Y!A be one of those blocked sites?

"what is the meaning of the fine structure constant 1/137? .  . The fine-structure constant  is of dimension 1 (i.e., it is simply a number) and very nearly equal to 1/137. It is the ""coupling constant"" or measure of the strength of the electromagnetic force that governs how electrically charged elementary particles (e.g., electron, muon) and light (photons) interact. Currently, the value of  having the smallest uncertainty comes from the comparison of the theoretical expression ae(theor) and experimental value ae(expt) of the anomalous magnetic moment of the electron ae. Starting in the 1980's, a new and wholly different measurement approach using the quantum Hall effect (QHE) has caused excitement because the value of  obtained from it independently corroborates the value of  from the electron magnetic moment anomaly. The QHE value of  does not have as small an uncertainty as the electron magnetic moment value, but it does provide a significant independent confirmation of that value. \n\nThe quantity  was introduced into physics by A. Sommerfeld in 1916 and in the past has often been referred to as the Sommerfeld fine-structure constant. In order to explain the observed splitting or fine structure of the energy levels of the hydrogen atom, Sommerfeld extended the Bohr theory to include elliptical orbits and the relativistic dependence of mass on velocity. The quantity , which is equal to the ratio v1/c where v1 is the velocity of the electron in the first circular Bohr orbit and c is the speed of light in vacuum, appeared naturally in Sommerfeld's analysis and determined the size of the splitting or fine-structure of the hydrogenic spectral lines. Sommerfeld's theory had some early success in explaining experimental observations but could not accommodate the discovery of electron spin. Although the Dirac relativistic theory of the electron introduced in 1928 solves the main aspects of the problem of the hydrogen fine-structure,  still determines its size as in the Sommerfeld theory. Consequently, the name ""fine-structure"" constant for the group of constants below has remained: \n\n , \n \n where e is the elementary charge,  = h/2 where h is the Planck constant,  = 1/Âµ0c2 is the electric constant (permitivity of vacuum) and Âµ0 is the magnetic constant (permeability of vacuum). In the International System of Units (SI), c, , and Âµ0 are exactly known constants. \nOur view of the fine-structure constant has changed markedly since Sommerfeld introduced it over 80 years ago. We now consider  the coupling constant for the electromagnetic force and similar to those for the other three known fundamental forces or interactions of nature: the gravitational force, the weak nuclear force, and the strong nuclear force. Further, since  is proportional to e2, it is viewed as the square of an effective charge ""screened by vacuum polarization and seen from an infinite distance."" \n\nAccording to quantum electrodynamics (QED), the relativistic quantum field theory of the interaction of charged particles and photons, an electron can emit virtual photons that can then emit virtual electron-positron pairs (e+, e-). The virtual positrons are attracted to the original or ""bare"" electron while the virtual electrons are repelled from it. The bare electron is therefore screened due to this polarization. The usual fine-structure constant  is defined as the square of the completely screened charge, that is, the value observed at infinite distance or in the limit of zero momentum transfer. At shorter distances corresponding to higher energy processes or probes (large momentum transfers), the screen is partially penetrated and the strength of the electromagnetic interaction increases since the effective charge increases. Thus  depends upon the energy at which it is measured, increasing with increasing energy, and is considered an effective or running coupling constant. Indeed, due to e+e- and other vacuum polarization processes, at an energy corresponding to the m"	Science & Mathematics

Do long distance relationships work? . I am engaged to a person millions miles away from me! I love him but want to know public opinion on the general issue of these relationships . Long distance relationships can work, contrary to popular belief.  My husband and I spent most of our courtship while far away from each other.  There are a few things that you HAVE to do in order for these types of relationships to work.\n\nFirst, you have to set boundaries and rules.  Express to your significant other about what they do when they're out and about that makes you uncomfortable.  Do you not like when he goes out with his single friends?  Do you hate it when he drinks too much?  Make sure that you are also making sacrifices if your significant other asks.  These relationships are always about give and take.\n\nSecond, you have to make time for each other.  Phone calls and letters work best when you're really far apart.  If it's possible, save your money and plan a trip to see him.  If that's not possible, I would try to talk on the phone at least twice a day.  Try to write letters daily as well.\n\nThird, you have to keep in mind that a relationship is what you put into it.  If you put in great things, you will get great things in return.  Good luck, and I hope that your relationship works out for the best.	Family & Relationships

Eat with oatmeal for better results)\n\nAmino acids, if taken regularly, are generally believed to increase ejaculate fluid. On the other hand, zinc seems to improve both the amount of sperm produced as well as the sperm's ability to move spontaneously and independently. Together with amino acids, this will increase normal sperm count and volume significantly. \nAmino acids are believed to increase ejaculate fluid (not the amount of actual sperm necessarily) if taken regularly. Some amino acids include:\n\nL-ARGININE HCL\nStudies show sperm and semen volume doubles, fertility improves (even among men with low sperm counts or poor sperm motility), and sperm health and activity increase with supplementation. Arginine is found in high concentrations in nuts and seeds like peanuts and almonds. It can also be found in chocolate and raisins. Some Natural Sources: Nuts, sunflower seeds, sesame seeds, chocolate, popcorn, raisins, brown rice, carob, gelatin desserts, oatmeal, whole wheat bread, and protein rich foods. \n\nL-LYSINE\nResearchers find that this amino acids plus zinc increases sperm produced, stimulates testosterone production, and improves semen quality.\n\nEPIMEDIUM SAGITTATUM\nSometimes called ""horny goat weed,"" this botanical boosts libido and testosterone levels for greater sperm production for a strong ejaculation.\n\nZINC OXIDE\nHas been shown to increase number of sperm and sperm motility by 80% to 200% by aiding testosterone synthesis.\n\nL-CARNITINE\nThis amino acid is found in high concentrations in healthy sperm.

Coupled with amino acids (see above), this will increase sperm volume significantly.\n(Butter's note: Not as miraculous as they make it sound, but regular zinc intake (50mgs a day) does increase quantity somewhat.)\n\nWhatever a pill company's claims are, you can probably do just as well with zinc and lecithin supplements. (Use zinc supplements in moderation; too much zinc intake can be dangerous.) For some guys, these nutrients do have a noticeable effect on ejaculation volume, and they're a lot cheaper and easier to get. In general, stay away from mail-order pills sold by less-than-reputable companies; you really don't know what's in them, and their claims are almost always untrue or at least greatly exaggerated.\n\nPC Exercises:\nWhile Kegel exercises can help you last longer, they can also aid in increasing sperm volume.

The first is a third-order aberration, which occurs for objects (or parts of objects) away from the optical axis. This form of aberration occurs even when the optical system is perfectly symmetrical.

how can i convert a .Bin file to an .Avi file ? .  . A .bin file has many uses. It is used by many virus scanners and anti-spyware software as an update file for example.\n\nWhile t could be a Mac file, in this case it is probably not.\n\nOne of the main uses of .bin files right now is the creating and burning of CD-Images. When a CD is completely ripped to a .bin file, a .cue file is also created that contains information on the .bin file for burning or mounting software. A .cue file is also created when a .bin file is actually made from files on a HDD and not from a CD.\n\nIf you were to look through your hard drive, you would probably find a lot of files with the .bin extension, but don't be fooled, these are not all CD Images and they are most likely very important to your operating system or software that you have installed.\n\nHowever, if creating CD images, creating cue/bin images is highly recommended; that's why it's the most used CD image today.

I need the meaning of the 7th article of faith. Can you help me?( i am lds and i need this for a talk)? . infomation for talk . The seventh Article of Faith explains that members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints believe in various spiritual gifts:\n\nWe believe in the gift of tongues, prophecy, revelation, visions, healing, interpretation of tongues, and so forth.\n\nMembers of the church believe that these gifts are bestowed upon those who desire to serve God, through the power of the Holy Ghost. We do not hold all of these gifts at the same time. We are given these gifts at times when they are needed to fulfill Godâs purposes upon the earth, and when they can be used to benefit and bless the lives of others.\n\nâNow there are diversities of gifts, but the same Spirit.\nAnd there are differences of administrations, but the same Lord.\nAnd there are diversities of operations, but it is the same God which worketh all in all.\nBut the manifestation of the Spirit is given to every man to profit withal.â (1 Corinthians 12:4-7)	Society & Culture

"What's d diference between a directory and a search engine? .  . A search engine is normally an automated computer that ""crawls"" the web looking for pages. All the pages it finds are put into an index with key information taken from the title of the page, keywords, meta tags, and the copy on the page. People can then use keywords to search the index for any matches.\n\nA Directory is normally a hand built, human edited system, where people review each site individually before adding it into the correct category (or subject area). Users can either browse the directory by clicking through different categories or can search the directory for specific keywords.\n\nThe advantages of a search engine are that they are often more up to date with breaking news and new sites and have a much wider range of sites in their index.\n\nThe advantage of a Directory is that each site is normally good quality as it has been checked by a human and is less prone to being ""spammed"" by unscrupulous site owners trying to artificially inflate their ranking.\n\nSearch Engines:\nhttp://uk.search.yahoo.com/\n\nDirectory:\nhttp://uk.dir.yahoo.com/\nhttp://www.dmoz.com/"	Computers & Internet

What is multiple sclerosis? .  . Multiple sclerosis is an autoimmune disease that affects the central nervous system (the brain and spinal cord). \nMultiple sclerosis (MS) usually affects woman more than men. The disorder most commonly begins between ages 20 and 40, but can strike at any age.\n\nThe exact cause is not known, but MS is believed to result from damage to the myelin sheath, the protective material which surrounds nerve cells. It is a progressive disease, meaning the damage gets worse over time. Inflammation destroys the myelin, leaving multiple areas of scar tissue (sclerosis). The inflammation occurs when the body's own immune cells attack the nervous system.\n\nThe inflammation causes nerve impulses to slow down or become blocked, leading to the symptoms of MS. Repeated episodes, or flare ups, of inflammation can occur along any area of the brain and spinal cord.\n\nSymptoms vary because the location and extent of each attack varies. Usually episodes that last days, weeks, or months alternate with times of reduced or no symptoms (remission).\n\nRecurrence (relapse) is common although non-stop progression without periods of remission may also occur.\n\nResearchers are not sure what triggers an attack. Patients with MS typically have a higher number of immune cells than a healthy person, which suggests that an immune response might play a role. The most common theories point to a virus or genetic defect, or a combination of both. There also appears to be a genetic link to the disease. MS is more likely to occur in northern Europe, the northern United States, southern Australia, and New Zealand than in other areas. Geographic studies indicate there may be an environmental factor involved.\n\nPeople with a family history of MS and those who live in a geographical area with a higher incidence rate for MS have a higher risk of the disease.\n\nCheck out this article with excellent illustrations:\nhttp://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/000737.htm	Health

Thank you. . really fast? lower your salt intake, water follows salt, if you dont eat salt your body wont absorb a ton of water.\n\nIf you want to loose it and keep it off it will take a little bit of time.  Look into joining a local YMCA.  Just run/walk a couple miles on a treadmill 3 times a week.  If you are dedicated you would take it off in a month.  Just cut out junk foods, especially late at night.  If you get hungry late at night eat fruit.  If you like candy/sweets, eat grapes! I love them they are awesome.\n\nJust be dedicated and you can do it!!  :)\n\nO YEA I FORGOT!!!  Drink a whole glass of water 10-15 minutes before you eat.  You will get full a lot faster.  If you feel like a snack, drink the water, wait 15 minutes, you might not actually want the snack.

Thankful for Him and all that He's done for me.\nGrateful for His providence and for making Himself known through His word.\nReassured by His promises.\nProtected, forgiven, humble, bold, loved, uplifted, joyous, peaceful because of His love.\n\n\n\nThis is for Margaretfong2:  My parents were highly perfectionistic and I was born with my hip joins unformed.  They closed in time (you would never know they was a problem today), but when I was a baby and should have been a source of great pride to them, they were ashamed of me.  My mother always used to complain that it took forever to have my younger sister because my father didn't want to have ""another deformed baby.""  \n\nThey've never really forgiven me for that.  And it was hard to believe that God (or anyone else for that matter) could love me.  And if He loved me, why did He give me parents that didn't.\n\nI think they'll have to answer for their actions.  God wants all children to be loved and cared for.  Their failure was part of that double edged sword of free will.  As an adult I can see the compensatory abilities God gave me.  I wouldn't go back and relive my childhood for everything in the world times two, but I wouldn't trade what I've learned from it, either.\n\nThese are some of the verses that I find comforting when I feel alone:\n\nWhen my father and my mother forsake me,\nThen the LORD will take care of me. Psalm 27:10\n\n\nTherefore humble yourselves under the mighty hand of God, that He may exalt you in due time, casting all your care upon Him, for He cares for you. I Peter 5:6-7\n\nAs a father pities his children,\nSo the LORD pities those who fear Him.\nFor He knows our frame;\nHe remembers that we are dust. Psalm 103:13-14\n\nAre not two sparrows sold for a copper coin? And not one of them falls to the ground apart from your Fatherâs will. But the very hairs of your head are all numbered. Do not fear therefore; you are of more value than many sparrows. Matthew 10:29-31\n\nYou number my wanderings;\nPut my tears into Your bottle;\nAre they not in Your book?

? is the largest desert in the world? .  . Antarctica is a desert.  It is what is known as a cold desert, which is probably why you find that it is not classified along with hot deserts like the Sahara.  A hot desert is defined by geographers as a region where the rate of evaporation exceeds precipitation, and where precipitation is below 254 mm per year.  In a cold desert, by contrast, there is little evaporation, so low \nprecipitation alone determines its status as a desert.\n\nIn Antarctica precipitation is less in the interior of the continent than along the coasts.  The reason is that coastal areas are more open to the influence of cyclones.  In the interior of Antarctica precipitation is as low as 50 mm per year, while in coastal regions it can be as high as 250 \nmm per year.  Thus even coastal precipitation is usually within the range that we would consider to be a desert.  The entire continent is, therefore, a vast cold desert.  It is, larger than the Sahara (Antarctica is about 14.2 million square kilometers in size, and the Sahara is just over 9 million square kilometers).  \n\nAntarctica is clearly the largest desert on Earth.  The reason you do not often see it listed along with hot deserts \nis mainly just that people think of deserts as hot.	Education & Reference

how much gravity is on Venus? what are the temperatures in the daytime and nightime on Venus? . also, how long does it take to go to Venus? . Gravity on Venus is about 91% of the earth gravity.\nA day on Venus lasts 243 earth days. This, together with the Carbon Dioxide rich atmosphere (sort of a very high greenhous effect) makes temperatures high both in nighttime as well as daytime.\nVenus also rotates in the opposite direction compared to the earth.\nVenus is the hottest planet in our Solar System. Its cloud cover traps the heat of the sun (the greenhouse effect), giving Venus temperatures up to 480Â°C. The mean temperature on Venus is 726 K (452Â°C = 870Â°F).	Science & Mathematics
Physics problems need help? . A stone is catapulted rightward with an initial velocity of 28.0 m/s at an angle of 46.0Â° above level ground. Find its horizontal and vertical displacements at the following times after launch:\n(a) 1.00 s \n m (horizontal)\n m (vertical)\n(b) 1.70 s \n m (horizontal)\n m (vertical)\n(c) 4.1 s \n m (horizontal) \n m (vertical) . The equation necessary to find the horizontal and vertical positions of the stone are\nm horizontal = (Initial horizontal velocity)(time) + (.5)(horizontal acceleration)(time)^2\nm vertical = (Initial vertical velocity)(time) + (.5)(vertical acceleration)(time)^2\nSince your horizontal acceleration is zero, that part goes away.\nYour vertical acceleration is caused by gravity, so it should be about (-9.8m/s^2).\nYour Initial horizontal velocity is (28.0 m/s)(cos (46.0)) = 19.45 m/s\nYour Initial vertical velocity is (28.0 m/s)(sin (46)) = 20.14 m/s\nThus, your two equations are\nm (horizontal) = (19.45 m/s) (time) and\nm (vertical) = (20.14 m/s)(time) + (.5)(-9.8m/s^2)(time)^2\nPlugging in your numbers, you get\na) m(horizontal) = 19.45 m; m(vertical) = 15.24 m\nb) m(horizontal) = 33.1 m; m(vertical) = 25.9 m\nc) m(horizontal) = 79.75 m; m(vertical) = 0 m (back on the ground)	Science & Mathematics

Why don't poor countries just print enough money to get them out of poverty? .  . Unfortunately it seems that some try, that is why they are so poor. Printing more money only reduces the value of the money.\nIf gold became as widespread as paper it would lose its value, as diamonds would if they were as common as pebbles.\nThe same is true with money, there needs to be a limited amount to make the money valuable.\nPoor countries have got to make the value, to get out of poverty, not the tokens for the value.\nRich countries have worsened the condition of the poor countries by buying at low prices from them, and selling at high prices elsewhere.\nFairtrade is a system trying to redress the problems of the poor, but we as customers prefer to buy cheap, which encourages the companies to carry on exploiting the poor countries.

It happens.\nI personally have never been in love, because I don't believe in it. But, to be fair, I won't deny that it doesn't exist, because I see it every day--in my parent's eyes. Love is a certain bond, a very strong bond that exists between two people.

how does electro[oration facilitate introduction of foreign DNA into a cell? .  . electroporation just opens big holes (pores) on the cell membrane.  Once the holes are there, you can introduce the dna by just floating it in the same solution.  Electroporation has about a 70% integration percentage, while other less high tech methods have about a 20 to 30% only.  Your highest percentage will be with a virus or plasmids, but that takes far more manufacturing than just having the dna and send it in through electroporation.\nCheers.	Science & Mathematics

My son had a recent blood test with high CPK levels. Could this be from weight lifting? . My son had a blood test that showed extremely high CPK levels. (11,000 and then confirmed at 15,000)  He recently was lifting weight (heavy) for the first time. We went to the ER and he was admitted. He was givel IV liquids and the levels dropped to 6000 then 4900 then 2000 over two days. It was NOT the CPK MB that shows cardiac damage.His renal functions were all normal. I've looked but couldn't find anything on the internet with people showing this extreme level. Now that the level is down significantly, should we be worried. The hospital is releasing him with another follow up test tomorrow. . CPK  is creatine phosphokinase, an enzyme found in heart, muscle, and brain tissue. An elevation in CPK  most often alerts physicians to order an MB fraction, the one specific for cardiac (heart). Usually if the MB fraction is normal you can rule out cardiac damage. Therefore, it is very likely that  your son had  high CPK levels due to the weight lifting because of severe muscle strain	Health

My stomach is swollen to the point that I look to be 5 mos pregnant. I also have alot of pain in my lower back clear across. I'm not pregnant and 34 yrs old. Anyone have a clue to what I may have? . I believe that you need to see a doctor as soon as possible. I would explain the symptoms to the receptionist so that she will realize the importance of your situation. The symptoms that you describe: ovarian cysts,ovarian tumor(which could be multiple cysts formed on the ovary). I know the word tumor sounds strong yet I recommend that you seek help soon. If this releases any anxiety-ovarian cancer is very slow growing-it develops over many years.On the other hand ovarian cysts are quick growing and many women do not even realize they have any. I have had an ovarian tumor and cysts. The tumor was the size of a grapefruit and benign-it was multiple cysts growing on one ovary.The ovarian cysts that I would get, on the other ovary-would sometimes ""burst"" on their own. Prior to the cyst ""bursting"" I would have extreme pain and after the ""bursting"" the pain would be gone.It is not uncommon for females to have ovarian cysts. In both scenarios-my period would become erratic,such as no periods and then having periods two weeks apart etc. In any event, I again would recommend you see a Dr. as soon as possible and if the pain becomes intense-be seen in the emergency room. I hope this helps."	Health

Are there any real Israelites in existence today? . Please refer to 2Kings 17:17-21. And the Book of Hosea 1:6-7. . Romans 11:1 I say then, Hath Yah cast away his people? Yah forbid. For I also am an Israelite, of the seed of Abraham, of the tribe of Benjamin.\n\n2 Yah hath not cast away his people which he foreknew.\n\n3 For what if some did not believe? shall their unbelief make the faith of YAH without effect?\n\n4 YAH forbid: yea, let YAH be true, but every man a liar; as it is written, That thou mightest be justified in thy sayings, and mightest overcome when thou art judged.\n\nBrother Paul is letting the Gentiles (Romans) know that Yah has not cast away his people Israel. Yah cannot or will not completely destroy Israel, because it is the job of the Israelites to teach the world of the coming kingdom. Yah also tells us in the book of Jeremiah.\n\nJeremiah 31: 35 Thus saith Yah, which giveth the sun for a light by day, and the ordinances of the moon and of the stars for a light by night, which divideth the sea when the waves thereof roar; Yah of hosts is his name:\n\n36 If those ordinances depart from before me, saith the LORD, then the seed of Israel also shall cease from being a nation before me for ever.\n\n37 Thus saith Yah; If heaven above can be measured, and the foundations of the earth searched out beneath, I will also cast off all the seed of Israel for all that they have done, saith the LORD.\n\nYah said if the sun and moon no longer shines in the sky then Israel is cast away, he also said if you can measure the heavens or measure the earth beneath then Israel will be cast away. The sun is still in the sky at day and the moon and stars still shine at night, so Israel has not been cast away, we are still his chosen people. So if a man comes to you preaching doctrine that says Israel is no longer accepted or chosen in the Fathers eye, then you show him the previous scriptures of what the Most High says about this.\n\nThe order that Yah has ordained from the beginning of time is this: \nYah, Yahshuah, The angels and Israel.\n\nYah gives the word to Yahshuah,  Yahshuah gives it to the angels, and the angels give it to Israel and Israel takes it to the rest of mankind.\n\nThis is why Paul told the Romans in the book of Romans 11: that he is an Israelite, so Paul was saying if the Israelites are cast away then he wouldnât be teaching them.

"What is a bearer debt? .  . hope this definition helps you:\n\n""Bonds may be issued in either bearer or registered forms. A bearer bond is payable to the bearer of the instrument. Therefore, its ownership is not recorded with the issuer. For an owner to receive a periodic interest or principal payment, a coupon attached to the bond for that interest payment date must be clipped off and sent to the issuer. The ownership of registered bonds is recorded with the issuer, so interest and principal payments can be disbursed automatically. Most bonds issued in recent years are registered and their ownership is tracked electronically.""\n\nhere debt referres to bonds and bearber is used as a certain type of corporate bond"	Business & Finance

What is the difference between DIVIDEND and INTEREST ? .  . Interest = Cash/Debt\n\nInterest is a percentage cash payment regularly paid to a creditor from a lender according to an agreed-upon rate.  No shares are involved the only thing the lender owns is the debt itself.  (When you use a savings account in most cases you are the lender and the bank is the creditor.)\n\nDIVIDEND = Equity\n\nA Dividend is a payment to a shareholder based on ownership of some sort of non-cash, non-debt equity such as a share of stock, mutual fund, credit union share, or money market account.  Not all dividends are paid regularly, not all are paid in cash, and they are usually not based on published rates.	Business & Finance

Any ideas on how to formulate a household budget? . I have tried for years to get my family on a budget but have been unsuccessful. ANy help or website info you guys can provide? . First you need to know what your net income is.  In case you don't know what this is:  Net income is the income after taxes (remember we have to pay Uncle Sam first) and other deductions.\n\nYou'll also need to know the expenses you have per month. \n\nI'll give you a typical budget.\n\nExample for a Monthly budget:\n\n2500.00 Net Income\n\n0850.00 Rent or Mortgage\n0100.00 House insurance\n0100.00 Gas\n0050.00 Phone\n0050.00 Electricity\n0040.00 Cell phone\n0250.00 Food\n0100.00 Clothes\n\n1540.00 Total expenses\n\n0960.00 Balance\n\nThere are expenses that you cannot change.  For instance, the rent or mortgage do not vary  unless you move somewhere else or get a new mortgage.\n\nEverything else on this budget can be changed.  \n\nIf you see that you don't have enough money to pay the rent, then don't eat out that much, don't buy those extra pair of sneakers just because they were beautiful.\n\nIn the above budget, you have 960.00 extra per month.  You can choose to spend it all on beautiful sneakers.  I would advise you to save some of it for a rainy day. After all, 950.00 on sneakers is pretty high.  Don't you think?\n\nBesides, if you don't own a house now, maybe you'll want to save it for a house. I don't know.  Maybe you prefer to go on a vacation.  My point is:  DO NOT SPEND ALL YOUR MONEY UNLESS YOU HAVE TO.  ONE DAY YOU MIGHT NEED IT.\n\nOf course, your budget might differ from above.  I  did not take diapers for your toddlers into consideration.  Neither did I take medical costs, babysitters, or entertainment into consideration.  \n\nI figure that this is enough for you to see how a budget works.  \n\nRemember, if your income is greater than your expenses, don't spend what you have left on stupid things.\n\nIf your income is less than your expenses, you are in big trouble.  Therefore, cut down on the expenses.\n\nKeep in mind, however, that sometimes you need to spend money on stupid things.  They nourish your soul.	Business & Finance
"Why some white people think that they are more superior than other race? . Again, I'm not saying ALL OF THEM, I'm saying just some of them. Please give honest opinion besides ""THAT IS NOT TRUE"" because we all know that's a lie. . It all depends on how a person was raised. A lot of white children are raised to think that they are better. A lot of people are afraid of things they dont know and if a person is different then that can be a reason. People of different races talk different, have different lifestyles and even may look different. A lot of it is that white people were raised thinking they were supreior. Also because a lot of white people are very ignorant and havent let the old days go. Society also has a lot to do with it. If you look around in our media and gov. its usually white people portaryed good and a lot of other races portrayed negatively. racism has been around as long as anyone can remmber.

what are the characteristics of steam coal and how it is transported by ship.? .  . steam coal is a generic term for coal that is suitable for use in steam boilers.  That type of coal generally has a caloric value of from 12,000 to 16,000 btus per pound (.45 kg).   In general bituminous coal is used as steam coal.  It is a hard coal and has a high btu content per pound but not so high as anthracite.  Anthracite is normally not used as steam coal because it is not so plentiful. Only about 1% of coal is classified as anthracite. \n\n47% of the coal mined is classified as lignite and sub-bituminous coal.  These are sort of dirt that will burn, if you will pardon the expression.  They are also used in power plants, but contain much less energy per pound than steam coal. \n\nMetallurgical coal is very simial to steam coal but in general is a higher grade coal and sells for more money per ton.  It is coal that is suitable for making coke and PCI coal which is also used in making steel but is less suitable for making coke. Normally lower ash and sulfur content. \n\nCoal is taken from the mines in trainload quatities in coal cars and transported to the coal docks where the cars are dumped  onto a conveyor belt that transports the coal onto a dump tower above the ship's hold.  The ship is a bulk carrier and has basically an open cargo hold. The coal is bulk dumped into the hold.  When the ship is full, the conveyor belt stops and the ship sails to its destination where the coal is unloaded and conveyed by truck or rail to its final use.	Business & Finance

Is this a good enough reason to switch schools? Or should I stay at cal poly( a large state school)  and try to finish there? . I'm an ME major at ucsd and it's a pretty decent school. You have to understand though, that UCSD is also a large state school. I hear SLO is pretty good and to be honest, the education is probably the same as UCSD (could  be better even). It also costs a lot less money.  Rent is higher here too. However, the degree might look better from UCSD. UCSD also has a lot more people\n\nFrom reading your question, it seems you are a little unhappy. College is what you make of it. Though I will tell you UCSD has its share of introverted people too.\n\nMy personal opinion is yes, give UCSD a shot. Why? well because you clearly don't like SLO.

"Have you considered? . While I agree that the President is guilty of abuse of power, including illegal eavesdropping, outright lying, corruption, and arrogance to the point of killing thousands of Americans, and hundreds of thousands abroad, he should not be impeached.\n\nConsider, if Bush is impeached, Cheney will be president. The politics of corruption will only continue unabashed. \n\nWould it be best to stay with the enemy you know, rather than hand more political power to a new, more evil enemy? . Since your assumptions for which there is no evidence, shows your stupidity, Lets consider some facts. The President has never even been accused of abuse of power, except by a few of the Demacrooks who are still mad because they can't seem to win an election, no mater how they try to cheat or how many of them go to jail for election fraud.\nThere has been no illegal eavesdropping by this President even though there was quite a bit of illegal wire tapping during Clinton's term. You can not state even one ""out right lie"" that Bush has told, though Clinton has a legacy of having told several. Nor has he killed thousands of Americans, much less hundreds of thousands abroad. Your lies demonstrate just how stupid you are. To date, there have been 2466 TOTAL American GI's that have died since the war started in Iraq. 714 of those, as of three months ago were non-combat deaths.

Antisocial behavior can be broken down into two components: the presence of antisocial (i.e., angry, aggressive, or disobedient) behavior and the absence of prosocial (i.e., communicative, affirming, or cooperative) behavior. Most children exhibit some antisocial behavior during their development, and different children demonstrate varying levels of prosocial and antisocial behavior. Some children may exhibit high levels of both antisocial and prosocial behaviors; for example, the popular but rebellious child. Some, however, may exhibit low levels of both types of behaviors; for example, the withdrawn, thoughtful child. High levels of antisocial behavior are considered a clinical disorder. Young children may exhibit hostility towards authority, and be diagnosed with oppositional-defiant disorder. Older children may lie, steal, or engage in violent behaviors, and be diagnosed with conduct disorder. Mental health professionals agree, and rising rates of serious school disciplinary problems, delinquency, and violent crime indicate, that antisocial behavior in general is increasing.	Health
what u guys think abou this question ? . The legislature passes an appropriation bill that includes some spending items the governor likes and some that he doesnât like.  Can the governor veto the items he doesnât like while signing the rest into law? . This has been a very controversial question, because some states have the line item veto, and the US President had it for a few years but it was allowed to lapse.\n\nThe main points of controversy are:\n\n1-Spending the taxpayers' money is under the responsibility of the legislative branch, and the legislative does not have the right to give its powers to another branch, at least without some sort of oversight.\n\n2-The executive is still a party politician, and the ability to strike out specific programs is definitely a weapon that can be used against individual legislators or individual states or localities.

The first column can be what will be the postive results of your decision. The second column will be what will be the negative results of your decision.\n\nAdd you answers up in each column.

"Will people later be using Ethanol? . Will people be using Ethanol as Americas future? . The largest single use of ethanol is as a motor fuel and fuel additive. The largest national fuel ethanol industries exist in Brazil. The Brazilian ethanol industry is based on sugarcane; as of 2004, Brazil produces 14 billion liters annually, enough to replace about 40% of its gasoline demand. Also as a result, they announced their independence from Middle East oil in April 2006. Most new cars sold in Brazil are flexible-fuel vehicles that can run on ethanol, gasoline, or any blend of the two. In addition, all fuel sold in Brazil contains at least 25% ethanol.\n\nThe United States fuel ethanol industry is based largely on corn. As of 2005, its capacity is 15 billion liters annually. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 requires U.S. fuel ethanol production to increase to 28 billion liters (7.5 billion gallons) by 2012. In the United States, ethanol is most commonly blended with gasoline as a blend of up to 10% ethanol, known as E10 and nicknamed ""gasohol"". This blend is widely sold throughout the U.S. Midwest, which contains the nation's chief corn-growing centers.\n\nIn 2005, the Indy Racing League announced its cars will run on a 10% ethanol - 90% methanol blend fuel, and in 2007, the cars will race on 100% ethanol.\n\nThailand, India, China and Japan have now launched their national gasohol policies. Thailand started blending 10% ethanol for its ULG95 in 1985; now there are more than 4000 stations serving E10. The blending of 10% ethanol into gasoline will be mandated by the end of 2006 with the import ban on MTBE. It is expected that once the production of ethanol from cassava and sugar cane- molasses can be ramped up, a higher blending ratio like E20 or E85 or even Flexible Fuel Vehicle will be introduced to Thailand.\n\nEthanol with a water content of 2% or less can be used as the alcohol in the production of biodiesel, replacing methanol, which is quite dangerous to work with.\n\nGeneral Motors of Canada are preparing the launch of E85 flex-fuel vehicles, and will be sold at the same price as their gasoline-only versions. Most of these new vehicles are being produced in Oshawa, Ontario."	Business & Finance

Wasn't Andrew a more interesting disciple?He calmed storms, defeated huge armies, and helped bring earthquakes . Acts of Andrew (burned by the church)\n\nLike those in the two books of Acts on which it appears based, the miracles are extremely supernatural, and highly extravagant. For example, aside from the usual miracles of raising the dead, healing the blind, and so forth, Andrew survives being placed amongst fierce animals, calms storms, and defeats armies simply by crossing himself. There is also a great deal of moralising - Andrew causes an embryo which was illegitimate to die, and also rescues a boy from his incestuous mother, an act resulting in her laying false charges against them, requiring god to send an earthquake to free Andrew and the boy. So much does the text venture into the realm of extreme supernatural events, that, whilst crucified, Andrew is still able to give sermons for 3 days.\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acts_of_Andrew\n\nWere church officials afraid this one might make the bible even less believeable? . Again -- the Acts of Andrew was not written by an immediate disciple of Jesus Christ, or authenticated by an immediate disciple of Jesus Christ.\n\nAnd the Acts of Andrew was written much later than the NT gospels.\n\nThat is why it was not included in the New Testament canon.\n\nCordially,\nJohn	Society & Culture

The problem is i want to get a ripped body with a six pack and cuts, instead i am getting bulky and built. how do i get ripped? not a big chest or fat arms. I want cut up body. I heard you are suppose to do more reps than weight to get cut up any help? . Basic rule of thumb: Heavy weights and low repetitions will give you strength and bulk. Lighter weights and high repetitions will yield more ""cut"". Example: You're doing tricep dips manipulating your body weight on a Monday. You do (3) sets of (10) reps and Monday evening your arms are swollen up like balloons. Then on Thursday you should try a tricep extension press @ 50% of your body weight (or half the weight you lifted on Monday) but this time do (3) sets of 25 repetitions. This will give you cut and help build endurance. Also note; resting a muscle group is just as important as training that muscle group to insure adequate growth and to avoid injury."	Health

I understand what you're saying, but you forgot one small thing:\n\nThe bowling ball has more mass, and therefore needs more pull to reach the same speed because of momentum. You know, it's harder to push a car than push a cup. The momentum pull and the pull of gravity completely cancel each other out, so all things fall at 9.81 m/s/s.	Science & Mathematics

How can I remove the singing / lyrics from the mp3 clips, leaving only music playing? . I believe Wavepad can. If there isn't a built in filter, I think you need to make copy's of both the left and right channel wave forms, inverse them, then mix them into the opposite channels. This will cancel any lead vocals, because lead vocals are always mixed evenly in both stereo channels in order to make them centered. Most all of the music and any background vocals should still be there, because they are separated into the left and right channels. This is how they make karaoke music.	Computers & Internet

For a human body falling though air in a spread-eagle position, the numerical value of the constant D is about D = 0.250 kg/m.\n\nWhat value of D is required to make v_t = 42.0 m/s the terminal velocity of a skydiver of mass 85.0 kg? answer in kg/m\nTake the free fall acceleration to be g = 9.80 m/s^2.\n\nIf the sky diver's daughter, whose mass is 40.0 kg, is falling through the air and has the same D (D=0.25 kg/m) as her father, what is the daughter's terminal speed?\n\nIm not sure if D is drag constant, question does not clarify. . I think that ""D"" is a combination of the drag coefficient, the denisty of air, and the cross-sectional area of the skydiver.  I make that assumtion because they don't provide any of that information, and the units work out.  I don't know if it encapsulates the ""2"" in the terminal velocity formula or not.  The numbers look prettier if you assume it does.\n\nSo use the formula: Vt^2 = (m x g) / D\n\nVt = Terminal Velocity\nm = mass\ng = acceleration of gravity (9.8m/s^2)\nD = ""the constant""\n\nsolve for D:  \nD = (85 x 9.8)/(42^2)\nD = .472\n\n\nfor part 2, solve for Vt:  \nVt = sqrt((40 x 9.8)/.0.25)  \nVt = 39.6\n\nBy the way, the first answer is really really wrong."

"Why the word gay changed over time?is it because of society's moral values? .  . No, the word ""gay"" has become associated with homosexual over time due to the association between its former meaning (""gay"" meaning ""carefree,"" ""light-hearted,"" ""bright and showy"") and the carefree but ""showy"" attitude many homosexuals exhibit. (See link below for additional information.)\n\nIt has nothing whatsoever to do with a change in values. Society is no worse now than it was at the dawn of civilization. Homosexuality has existed since the dawn of man, and so have murder, prostitution, hatred, abuse, and oppression. We tend to idealize previous centuries, but even during the Middle Ages when organized religion was at its zenith, humans engaged in all sorts of social ills. If you don't believe me, read any scholarly history book on the period and find out for yourself. I specifically recommend starting with ""A Distant Mirror: The Calamitous Fourteenth Century"" by Barbara Tuchman, to start. (See link below)"	Education & Reference

"At what temperature should a parent take an 8 year old to the emergency room? .  . It depends on a lot of factors, including what other symptoms are being exhibited, what have you tried to do to bring it down, how long has it been up, what were the circumstances surrounding the high temperature (was the child covered up, asleep, running around, etc.), what is your child's ""normal"" high temperature (some children run higher fevers than others), and how was the temperature taken (ear thermometers are notoriously inaccurate)?  For some children it is not unusual to run a fever around 105 or 106.  For others, 104 is extremely high.  Generally, speaking, I wouldn't go to the emergency room for just a fever, but if the child is running a high fever (over 101, at least) and seems lethargic, complains of a headache, or just seems particularly ill, then it would be worth a trip to calm your nerves, if nothing else."

"What is Singleton class in Java? .  . Singleton classes have only one instance of the class. They are accessed like StaticFactory classes, i.e. SingletonClass.instance(). This commonality of syntax allows a StaticFactory class to be converted to a Singleton and vice versa during refactoring. A Singleton class has the following properties: \n\nThe class must be final \n\nThe class must have a single, private, no argument, constructor that throws IllegalStateException if it is called more than once \n\nIf the class is serializable then it should have a readResolve method that returns the 'singleton' \n\nThe class can't be clonable \n\nThe class must have a method called instance (see below for more details) \n\nThis instance method must: \n\nAlways return the same object \n\nHave no arguments \n\nBe static \n\nHave either package or public access \n\nThe advantages of singletons are well documented in Joshua Block, Effective Java, ""Item 2: Enforce the singleton property with a private constructor"", pp 10. Note: Joshua Block uses either a static field called INSTANCE or a static method called getInstance, as noted above this design of a singleton uses a static method called instance to be compatible with factory classes. \n\nIf a class is definitely a singleton with no chance of ever becoming a factory then consider using a NoInstance class instead.

what pc game should i get and why? .  . battlefield 2. it has the best graphics, diversity of gameplay, smallest learning curve, varying challenge, interaction, and realism combination of any game I have played.\nNOT that each one of those qualities is the best, however, it does have the best _combination_. \n\nIt is an online game that is 3d and in the first person. There is no single player 'story mode'. However, you can play single player, but it will be similar to that of playing it online. Except instead of people, you will be playing alongside and against 'bots' (computer controlled players).\nThere is also a ranking system that tracks your progress amongst everyone else who has the game.\nThe basic premise is two sides of a war battle it out on a 'map'. You can drive tanks, jeeps, boats, jets, helicopters, go on foot, etc.  The idea is to control most of the map as possible by capturing certain points on the map. After capturing certain areas, the enemy loses 'tickets' steadily which once they reach zero, they lose.\nYou can also use voice chat to talk to squad mates and have a very tightly knit feeling of teamwork. \nThere is also the ability to be commander and play a real-time strategy type of game completely different than the rest of the game. You tell squads what to do and inform them of what you're able to see, and you call in artillery strikes to clean out an area infested with the enemy.\nBattles can get pretty hairy and intense. If you like explosions and lots of intense situations and excitement this game has it.\nSince you can do so much, the visuals are great, the interaction with others, the intensity and challenge is awesome, and the fact that no particular 'round' is the same as another, I find it the best and most addictive.

"How do you check if a spot in a char array has a character there or not (C++)? . I'm having problems couting a character array. It couts the list of characters, plus a bunch of junk after it. So then I need to set up a while statement...\n\nbool notChar = false;\nint count = 0;\nwhile(notChar = false) {\n   cout temp[count];\n   count++;\n   if(temp[count] == ???) { notChar = true; }\n}\n\n...Any ideas? . char* or char[ ] types typically use a char value of 0 to mark the end of the string.\n\n however, ""cout"" will stop at this 0 automatically, so you obviously do not have a 0 at the end of the string.\n\n the best bet would be to not use a char* or char[ ] type at all, but use a STL::string type.  research the C++ standard tempalte libraries.  it has a string type with everything built in.\n\n  if you must use char* or char[ ], initialize your array to all 0's and never use the final size'd spot.  this is clumsy C programming though, not C++.  Use the STL in C++, it prevents many bugs."	Computers & Internet

what r the physiological effects of ethidium bromide poisoning? . Two years back my friend consumed etidium bromide when she was working in a lab orally and intra venous it was a suicide attempt but she survived nothing can be seen from out side she didnât informed anyone. Now she is getting pain in the pelvic region and joints and a small bulging in the arm where she injected the needle now she want to live but afraid of this past incident is it will cause any health problems in her life please help is it will cause any birth defect if she had a baby? Please please help . Studies have shown that ethidium bromide can mutate the DNA in various cell types. The formation of cancer cells is a common result of DNA mutation.\n\nSince your friend ingested ethidium bromide both orally and intravenously, a good portion of her body was exposed. Depending on the amount she was exposed to, her chances of developing various cancers could be greatly increased.\n\nI would highly suggest that she see her physician as soon as possible. There are many possible causes for joint pain, but based on the information provided, bone tumors/cancer could be a possibility. Similarly, there are many possible causes for pelvic pain, but considering that ethidium bromide was ingested, it could be indicative of gynecological tumors/cancer.\n\nI want to say this again: it is extremely important that she discusses her situation in detail with her physician as soon as possible! While her symptoms may not be the result of cancer, it is very important that she see her doctor to determine if they are before any cancer can advance to stages where treatment is no longer effective.\n\nGood luck, and God bless!

Colombia is a republic where the executive branch dominates government structure. Up until recently, the president was elected together with the vice-president by popular vote for a single four-year term, which functioned as both head of government and head of state. However, on October 19, 2005 the Colombian Congress amended the constitution, which now allows Colombian presidents to serve up to two consecutive four-year terms.	Politics & Government

We can actually see what good is happening in Iraq.  We know what the news refuses to tell Americans.  However, the Iraqi's do need to step it up and take control.  They need to assert more pressure.  It all comes down to the majority of the troops believing in what they're doing.  Don't forget, this is a volunteer military and many of those serving in Iraq joined after 9/11 and knew what the risks were.  \n\nFor those that say the military can't speak out, you're very wrong.  They can and do.  For the idiot who said to watch 9/11, that's just what everyone needs to see....some biased propaganda so Michael Moore can make money off the fools who believe him.  It's been proved over and over and over that he lied and took what the troops said out of context.  Many filed charges against him for it.\n\nFor those of you who don't support the war and the troops, don't try to speak for us.  We can do that for ourselves.

How does one go about handling a demoralizing trainer who's also your boss? . This job is my sole source of income, so I just keep my mouth shut.  I really would like to tell her that I don't need this kind of demoralization.  It's not going to help me get it any faster.  But if she gave me clearer instructions without stammering it would simplify what is expected of me.  But once I get home I get these physical reactions from the stress like a really bad inflammation in my mouth, a tooth / head ache.  To me, it's just another job that barely covers my living expenses.  I don't learn the best under oppression.  Everything I don't know already is wrong.  But if it never came up, then I am not going to know it.  She expects me to go digging.  She (my boss) is the owner.  I think I'll try to summarize everything she's expecting of me and throw it back at her to see if there is anything I left out. . I try to let them boss know I appreciate the guidance. If you're training, take notes and let her know you understand her point of veiw. Also, try not to take things personally if you're new. No one likes to be told they're doing something wrong, but try to be objective and not feel demoralized. You're not in grade school and you aren't going to get a sticker by your name if you do something right. You're expected to get things right and you have to motivate yourself.\n\nIf your job really sucks, look for another one. Just remember, there are none out there that don't come with problems. Also, get yourself in school if you aren't already, so you can do more than just scrape by in the future. The stress isn't half as bad if you know you'll be moving on to bigger and better things eventully.	Business & Finance

Multi Currency Account as an investment? . Can a Multi-Currency Account (an umbrella account that holds numerous currencies) be used as an investment? A speculative investment? Thank you. . This depends on the current political/economic welfare of the country that distributes each currency.\n\nFor instance, when the U.S. overthrew Saddam Hussien, the worth of the currency in Iraq dropped drastically.  Therefore, it was a great time to purchase Iraq currency, because from that point on it could only go up in value.

"Sigmund Freuds view on Religion? .  . Religion, in Freud's view, was simply a poor attempt to resolve the needs that often go unmet in human relationships. He developed this idea over 30 years in his enormous body of work, making it the main focus of his 1927 book, The Future of an Illusion, and extending his arguments from individual to society in his long 1930 essay, Civilization and Its Discontents. ""Religion may be altogether disregarded,"" he wrote in the latter work, ""Its doctrines carry with them the stamp of the times in which they originated, the ignorant childhood days of this human race."" To be truly civilized, he believed, humanity had to be set free of its delusions and construct a better order than religion could give it.\n\nFreud's atheism was not shaken by personal tragedy, though he experienced plenty of it. The proud father of six children, Freud saw two of his sons sent to fight in World War I and lost his daughter Sophie to the flu epidemic shortly thereafter. Cancer of the mouth plagued him for most of his adult life, and led to over 30 operations, through which he never stopped smoking. Freud's Jewish heritage made him a target of the rising anti-Semitism under Hitler's regime, and ultimately forced him to flee with his family to London in 1938. In response, Freud worked all the more fervently on what was to be his final work, Moses and Monotheism. This 1939 book was a retelling of the Hebrew Scriptures that casts Moses as a secular Egyptian hero whom the Israelites reject because his beliefs are too radical, paralleling the psychologist's feelings about his own work in the world."

"Do you believe in The End Times?Where we'll go to heaven or hell? .  . Yes, the ""end times"" are a fact of scripture.  They are upon us. \n\nChrist will return to earth for His people (believers) and restore peace and hope to the world.  Many will be destroyed by the plagues of God first, however.  Christ will establish peace and order on earth based on God's laws.\n\nAfter the 1000 year reign of Christ is completed, the resurrection of the rest of the dead will take place.  Billions of people will come back to life for an opportunity of salvation.  This is called the Great White Throne judgment period.  At the end of this period, God's enemies will be destroyed.  Death and the grave will be destroyed also.  There will be no more death ever, God promises.\n\nThose who believed God and turn to Him through faith believing also in His Son, Jesus Christ will be given eternal life.  These will live forever.\n\n""For God so loved the world, that He gave His only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in Him should not perish, but have everlasting life.""  John 3:16\n\nThe offer is for everyone who will believe."	Society & Culture
Taxes regarding long term and short term holdings of the same stock.? . Let's say I own stock in company XYZ, and I hold a number of shares for over a year.  Additionally, I am very comfortable with the stock and I want to play the fluctuations of the stock on a short term basis.\n\nSince I have a number of long term shares already, if I buy more of the stock this week, and sell some next week, is it possible to claim a long term holding deduction on my taxes? . There are numerous ways to do cost basis.  The way that you are referrring to is the FIFO method, which is fine.  You might pay a bit more if the stock went up since your cost basis for the original shares is lower, but this would be offset by the long-term treatment.\n\nAs long as you keep track of which shares went where with the dates and the rest of the documentation, you're free to use that method.

"Should I wait for Apple Intel Powerbook or should I just buy the current one with PowerPC chip? . I hope you are kind enough to provide the reason why also... Thank you for reading this question!  :oD . I bought mine five months ago, and around a month after that, the whole Intel thing was announced. I didn't regret buying it, since I've always wanted a Mac, and it's been the perfect bundle of joy(12"" Powerbook, love  of my life).\n\nNow, though, there are STRONG rumours about the Intel powerbooks coming out as early as January. I wouldn't be too surprised if Jobs springs them on us around Christmas. These are just rumours, though, and AFAIK Apple's stated aim is to bring them out some time in'06.\n\nSo, if you can wait around a month, there is a chance, however less, of the Intel macs being released. What I'd suggest is to read all those mac rumour sites, as well as mainstream media for indications of early release. I've done that, and the signs are strongly in favour of that. So, wait till Jan before you decide.\n\nIF the Intel macs are gonna come in Jan:\nPros:\n- they'll be better than the current PPC ones, and given Apple's propensity for aggressive market entry, priced pretty much the same, or lesser.\nCons:\n- Apple is notorious for bringing out very buggy 'first generation' portables. This is a risk you will have to weigh."	Computers & Internet

Are we really any closer to solving a cure for cancer? .  . 'Cancer' is a relatively non-speceific term.\n\nLocalised cancer can have a very good prognosis when appropriately treated. eg excision of a breast lump. \n\nWidespread (metastatic) cancer involving eg. lung, brain and bones has a poorer prognosis.\n\nSome cancers eg. prostate cancer are 'slow growing'. You can die with it instead of from it. Other cancers eg oesophagus (gullet) still remain relatively more difficult to treat.\n\n\nThe short answer is it depends...on what type of cancer, the stage, grade, general state of health etc. \n\nThere are cancer survivors all around us.

"Prove that sqrt(2) is irrational? . Ok..I've already been able to prove that the  square root(sqrt)of 2 is irrational by showing that it can not been written as a rational number.\n\nI found another proof using the Well Ordering Principle as the basis for this proof.  If anyone has seen this and understands it, can you explain it? . It's a little tricky, but here goes:\n\nOk, assume that rt2 can be written as a rational fraction, then there must be some integer, ""a"", such that a*rt2 is an integer.  For example, if rt2 were 3/4, then ""a"" would be 4.  4*3/4 = 3, an integer.\n\nAlso assume that, whatever number ""a"" is, it is the smallest possible integer.  As in the example, 8,12,16 etc would also yield integers, but 4 is the smallest one possible.\n\nSo to recap, we have a*rt2 is some integer.\n\nNow we also know that 1<rt2<2.  Subtract 1 all the way across 0<rt2 - 1<1\n\nso now we know that rt2-1<1, and, logically, a*(rt2 - 1) < a*rt2\n\nTake a moment, let all of that sink in...and moving on:\n\na*(rt2-1) = a*rt2 - a  --- THIS WILL ALSO BE AN INTEGER, we'll assign it a new variable, b, and remember that above we proved that b is less than a.\n\nIf b = a*rt2 - a \n\nThen by multiplying both sides by rt2 you get\n\nb*rt2 = 2a - a*rt2\n\nNow, if a is an integer, and a*rt2 is an integer, then 2a-a*rt2 must also be an integer.  And since it is equal to b*rt2, then b must also be an integer.\n\nBut wait - we said that in a*rt2, a was the smallest possible integer, and we know that b is smaller than a, so there is your contradiction.\n\n\nPersonally, I like the other proof better I think.  This one is quite nice, but it was rather difficult to explain.  Once it sinks in, though, it is actually simpler.  I hope this helps."	Science & Mathematics
If I do side jobs, as a welder, do I have to have workman's comp insurance? I do not have a business license. .  . Most general contractors are going to require you to carry the insurance especially if you have employees.  Most states allow an injured employee to file a claim against the general contractor if you as the subcontractor do not have the insurance.  As a matter of law, you may not legally have to carry the insurance if you do not employ more than a certain amount of employees depending on the state.  If you do not have a business license, you would probably be considered a casual employee under state law and would not have to carry the insurance.  Your earnings, however,  would be subject to  withholding requirements which may not be attractive.  Get you business license and the insurance and you will likely find that the work that becomes available will be more profitable.	Business & Finance

God bless you, my friend.  You are certainly obeying the Lord's will by abstaining from homosexual behavior while you are under the tremendous temptation that sex imposes on a young man. As with so many of life's tough problems, you must put yourself completely in Jesus' hands if you wish for a completely satisfactory solution.\nThe One who made the blind see, and the lame walk, is perfectly able to heal you of your desire for sexual immorality.  I pray you will direct your efforts to Him, and only to Him, as you struggle with your particular temptations.  Give Him your will, your heart, and your fleshly desires each morning, and whenever you feel the pull of sin.  And TRUST in Him!  Remember, He often told people that it was their FAITH that made His miracles happen.  \nI can't tell you how much I admire your courage in sticking by the Lord and tackling this difficult problem instead of just giving in to it as so many others have done.  May God look upon you in perfect love and mercy, and may He richly bless you with faith, and strength, and healing.  You'll be in my prayers, friend--hang in there!	Society & Culture

Why don't comic book publishers care about continuity anymore? . For example, we no longer get editorial notes letting us know what issues have past events, and characters get retconned to becoming something drastically different from what they were. why not just create a new character? . I think it depends on where you look.  In Marvel, for example, books like She-Hulk, Marvel Team-Up, The Thing and even more recently books like X-Factor and Friendly Neighborhood Spider-Man thrive on old continuity.  And while these won't have an editor's box... She-Hulk will quite often have one of the characters say something to lead you to the book before.  \n\nNow that is not to say other books don't have strong continuity.  Daredevil has been telling a solid story from about issue 26 on.  Even after getting a new writer and artist.  Books like Runaways and Young Avengers have continuity all their own.  \n\nAnd every Marvel book I have read lately has a nod to the past... or a little inside joke.  I think they just know their readers have been reading long enough to know the first appearance of Ultron or Scorpion.  \n\nAnd it takes a good writer to give the feeling that you can know any character in that first comic you pick up.  And I think the new event Civil War has done a very good job of keeping the readers informed.  You pick up the first issue and you know what other books tie-in.  And you are even told what came before.  Maybe they just don't want to hit people over the head with continuity.	Entertainment & Music

is there racism in utah against hispanic people? . im planning to move to salt lake city utah . Like anywhere, you have racist scumbags all over.

I would suggest sticking to downtown, West Valley City, Sugarhouse, Avenues or South Salt Lake areas as those are the most liberal and welcoming areas, as the more suburban areas can lean towards more exclusionary treatment of those not fitting the cultural mold.

"wat was the season finale of desperate housewives about? . because i missed it, so summary ne1?? . Okay, so here's the whole two-hour season finale in a nutshell: Tom is desperately trying to find Lynette, but she's well hidden in a hotel with the four Ps. Then a P breaks his arm and Lynette is forced to call Tom. In the hospital, he finally gets to explain his side of the story: apparently, he had a one-night stand with a woman twelve years ago, back before he met Lynette, and now it turns out that he has an eleven-year-old daughter. Lynette gamely agrees to meet the daughter and her mother, but only the mother shows up for the visit. Over lunch, the mother -- who is crazy -- screechingly demands that Tom back-pay eleven years' worth of child support. Lynette and Tom dig deep and manage to come up with a check for $30k, which the woman promptly uses for a down payment on a house in Fairview, surprise! Gabby begins to suspect that Carlos and Money are sleeping together, so she gets a doctor to check Money's oven and discovers that the once-immaculate virgin has turned whore. So then Gabby plants baby monitors all over the house and totally catches Carlos and Money in the act. Gabby makes the maid help her throw all Carlos's clothes out the window; then she screams at Carlos to go find somewhere else to live (even though, as Carlos is quick to point out, she'd given him permission to sleep around). When Money tries to leave, too, Gabby tells the maid that she isn't going anywhere -- not with Gabby's egg inside her, nope. Zana visits CreePaul in jail, and CreePaul bitchily commands him to go get money from Noah to pay for a fancy lawyer to help find a way out of Felicia's crazy finger trap. Zana begins to suspect that CreePaul maybe did kill Mrs. Huber, but nonetheless, he pays Noah a visit. Noah is barely hanging in there, yet he has just enough strength to manipulate Zana (by calling him chicken, basically) into turning off Noah's breathing machine. Now a cold-blooded murderer himself, and also a zillionaire, Zana completely turns his back on CreePaul -- stops visiting him, stops taking his calls. He also petulantly orders that the pond at Noah's house be filled in, huh? The newly independent Susan gets an RV so that she and Julie have a place to stay while their blackened house gets rebuilt. Mike is so impressed with Susan's hot display of a backbone that he races out and buys her a wedding ring. Unfortuconveniently, Karl spots Mike browsing in the jewelry shop. Karl, in a pique of calculated jealousy, races out and buys Susan and Julie a house. When the apparently-not-so-independent Susan accepts the house gift, Mike is so disappointed that he punches Karl. In the tussle, Mike's tooth gets chipped, and Susan sends him to Kyle McOrsonlan for some tooth-doctoring. McOrsonlan comments that Mike's mouth is full of prison dentistry, which gets Mike thinking that he recognizes McOrsonlan from somewhere, perhaps from prison? McOrsonlan hastily denies the connection. Meanwhile, Susan, who picked up on the fact that Mike was fixing to propose to her, decides to pop the question herself. She hearts-to-hearts with Karl, and -- using the ""if you love someone, set them free"" argument -- she gets him to sign the divorce papers. Then she invites Mike to a big romantic dinner. On his way to dinner, Mike stops to get flowers, and as he's crossing the street, a mysterious red car completely mows him down. And the driver? None other than the dark dentist McOrsonlan! Caleb gets arrested, and he immediately confesses to the murder of Melanie Foster. Down at the station, the police show Betty the crime-scene photos of Melanie's body, which the murderer had covered with his jacket. Betty recognizes the jacket; it belonged to Matthew, not Caleb -- meaning Matthew is the murderer!

"ruby bridges? . im writing a paper about her and im almost done i just half half of my second or third page to fill and it has to be 2 or 3 pages long so the pages have to be totally filled so do you have any info about her . Ruby Bridges was born in Mississippi to a family that was very poor. Her parents worked hard to provide for her, but there were many nights that there was nothing to eat for dinner. At the age of 4, Ruby and her family moved to New Orleans, Louisiana, where her parents obtained better jobs.\n\nIn 1960, the treatment of African Americans was not equal to that of whites. Black children attended different and separate schools than white children. While it was illegal to treat African Americans different than other people, much of the south didn't comply with these laws.\n\nWhen Ruby was old enough to begin school, a judge ordered her to attend an all white elementary school. She and her parents were so very proud to take part in this important event in history. The Bridges' family attended church every Sunday thanking God for this opportunity and asking for the strength to stand up for what they believed. Ruby's parents taught her the importance of holding her head high and to be proud of who she was, and that's exactly what she did!!\n\nRuby's first day at Frantz Elementary School in New Orleans came quickly. As she walked to school, she was escorted by two federal marshal's. The city and state officers in New Orleans refused to escort Ruby to school because they did not want Ruby to attend an all white school. So, the President of the United States, Dwight D. Eisenhower, intervened and sent federal marshals to protect Ruby. What would Ruby need protection from? Angry mobs!! Along the streets and sidewalks, Ruby faced several angry people screaming and yelling ""Blacks don't belong in our schools!"" As Ruby approached the Frantz Elementary School, the mobs got worse. It was a good thing Ruby had federal marshals to protect her because several of the people in the mob looked angry enough they could have hurt her. When she arrived safely inside the school building, she noticed that she was the only child there. In fact, the only other person inside was her teacher. Every child who attended Frantz Elementary School stayed home. Their parents didn't want their white children to attend school with Ruby because she was black. So, while Ruby was learning how to read and write, all of the other children stayed home.\nEach day, Ruby had to face these angry mobs as she walked to and from school. The days turned into weeks, and the weeks turned into months and still Ruby was the only one in the Frantz Elementary School receiving an education.\n\nOne day as Ruby was walking to school, she stopped in the middle of the angry mob and began to talk. This made the mob go crazy and they began yelling even louder. The federal marshals got scared at what the mob might do and urged Ruby to continue walking. Again, she arrived safely at school. Ruby's teacher asked her why she had stopped to talk to those angry people. Ruby corrected her teacher by telling her that she wasn't talking to the people, she was talking to God. Every day, as she walked to and from school, she would repeat this prayer:\n\nPlease, God, try to forgive those people\nBecause even if they say those bad things,\nThey don't know what they're doing.\nSo You could forgive them,\nJust like You did those folks a long time ago\nWhen they said terrible things about You \n\nLater that same year, Ruby was joined by two white children at the Frantz Elementary School. As each day passed and more children returned to school, the mob quit their protests. It was obvious that Ruby was not going to let the angry mob intimidate her. In fact, Ruby finished her first grade year at Frantz Elementary School and went on to graduate from high school.\nRuby is still living in the New Orleans area with her husband and 4 sons (all of which attended school in the New Orleans Public School System)."

"Is time travel possible? . Do . yes, traveling forward in time is definately possible, but we're not sure about back.  This has nothing to do with wormholes or anything, that probably wouldn't work.\n\nanyway, velocity distorts time. The faster you go, the slower time goes for you. This effect is negligable unless you are going very close to the speed of light. In fact the formula is:\nt'= t/sqrt(1-v^2/c^2)\nwhere t' is the time that has passed for a stationary observer, t is the time that has passed for you, sqrt means square root and ^2 means squared. As you can notice, when v is small, since c^2 is so huge, you get a miniscule decimal, and 1 minus that number is basically as small as .999999999999999 or something very very close to one, and so t' stays basically the same as t and time is not really affected. As v gets larger(it can never be the speed of light, then the denomonator would be zero) that fraction becomes closer to 1, so when you subtract it from one, the denomonator gets smaller and smaller, meaning t gets smaller(in order for t' to remain constant) this means that time slows down for the object moving at such velocities! time slows down, so it would feel like lets sayThis formula is correct, it is part of Einstein's theory of relativity, and I have had to derive it myself from ordinary mechanics formulas. \n\nThis proves the formula:\nAccording to the same factor, length also contracts. It has been observed in certain tiny particles coming to the earth's surface. These particles have a certain lifespan before they become unstable and decay. They are also moving at a certain speed. (which is very fast; close to the speed of light.) You should simply be able to calculate v=d/t (velocity=distance/time) to find out how far they would travel. However, they somehow travel farther than that. When this calculated distance is put into that formula, we come up with the correct distance they actually travel! \n\nSo yes, as you get faster and faster, since time slows down for you, theoretically, you could be moving at these speeds for a short time and time will seem to be moving normally for you, but have years and years pass for everyone else, thus traveling forward in time. As far as back in time... well, if you think about it, if things travel slower and slower the closer you get to light, does that mean it would stop when you reached it? and what would happen when you went faster, would it go back in time?  the only problem with this is that nothing can go faster than the speed of light, which has been considered ""the ultimate speed limit of the universe.""  Plus, if you were to go faster, the v^2/c^2 would be greater than one, meaning you'd get a negative number after subtracting it from one and have a negative number under the square root in that formula.  This is impossible.  Also, the problem with even traveling forward in time is that it would require immense amounts of energy to accelerate objects that fast.  It requires particle accelerators miles long just to get small sub-atomic particles to go that fast, imagine massive objects, it would be crazy. and distorting time by any reasonable amount would require going at least 90% the speed of light.. probably faster.  The closer you got to the speed of light, the more time would slow down for you.\n\nThere are also some other methods described in the book ""time travel in einstein's universe"" by Richard Gott, if you're interested."

"Why rain drops falling donot acquire high velocity? .  . mck\n14 hours ago\n\nReport Abuse\n\n\nIt is true that gravity increases the velocity of a falling object. However, there is also air resistance, which slows an object down while it is falling. This is dependent on a number of variables, one of which is the current velocity of the object. Therefore, as gravity causes the speed to increase, air resistance causes it to not increase as fast. At a certain point, the *terminal velocity* is reached, which means that the raindrop cannot speed up (because of air resistance) and cannot slow down (because of gravity).\n\nIf you actually mean why it doesn't hurt because of pressure, that's because a raindrop is ""soft"" - it can change shape when it hits your skin. However, freezing rain, although small, can hurt (I know from experience). Again, the velocity isn't great enough for it to actually puncture the skin (usually). \nSO the main causes r terminal velocity and air resistance."	Science & Mathematics

Great White Shark or Giant Alligator? . Has anyone witnessed an attack between a Great White shark and a giant aligator?  Which one would win? . By giant alligator, I think you are probably thinking of the Saltwater Crocodile (Crocodylus porosus) which inhabits northern Australia and is throughout the southeast Asian islands up to Bangladesh and India.\n\nThese crocs have been seen out at sea, and they are sometimes found with barnacles on them.  They would definitely have been found in waters that are also frequented by Great White Sharks (Carcharodon carcharias).\n\nThe saltwater croc is the largest living species of reptile, up to 6 or 7 meters long, and up to a ton in mass.  These big monsters tend to be set up in good territories inland though, it's the smaller and subordinate crocs that get pushed to out to sea in search of new territory.\n\nThe biggest Great Whites are also up to 6 or 7 meters in length, so it's a pretty close match as far as size.  Therefore, it's actually pretty unlikely that there would be a conflict.  \n\nMost predators won't fight without a reason.  There's too much as stake if they get injured to just attack things at random.  Unless one of the critters triggers the prey -> attack response in the other, they'd probably only fight to defend their territory.  Great Whites are pretty nomadic, and wouldn't have a territory, and the saltwater croc would be swimming between islands searching for his own territory, not interested in fighting sharks.\n\nAs far as prey responses, Great Whites favourite food is seals and sea lions.  One theory as to why humans are occasionally attacked is a superficial resemblance to a pinneped, especially if there's a surfboard involved.  The swimming pattern and body shape of a crocodile is nothing like the sea lion's, and it is very unlikely that a shark would mistake a croc for an easy meal.\n\nCrocodiles tend to sit in one spot, usually in murky water, and wait for prey to come close enough to trigger an attack response.  Mudcrabs, turtles, goannas, snakes, wading birds and fish are their most common prey, but they have been known to take buffalo, cattle, sheep, wild boar, monkeys and even humans.  A small, juvenile shark would likely be snapped up, but a full grown adult would probably be cruising deeper water and at faster speeds than something that a croc would attack.\n\nIf they did fight, both of them have immensely powerful jaws.  The crocodile is also covered in bony scutes that create almost a suit of armour over its body, especially its back.  The shark would probably lose many teeth trying to take a bite.  Both critters are remarkably tough too, being able to take a lot of damage and keep fighting, even if they are mortally wounded.  Should such an encounter occur, I would imagine that both animals would cause grievous, even mortal wounds to each other before breaking off the fight, and then they'd each end up dying of the wounds.\n\nEven cooler than a fight between a saltwater croc and a great white would have been a fight between a Deinosuchus (a huge late Cretaceous crocodylian possibly up to 50 feet long) and Carcharocles megalodon (a huge Eocene shark, possibly up to 50 feet long).  Too bad they didn't live at quite the same time.	Science & Mathematics

"Why is it that gay relationships are said to be prone to AIDS? . Some even say they were what begun AIDS in the first place.. Not that I believe it, but it strikes my curiosity.\n\nPlease, real answers - it is a serious question. . While there are exceptions to this, the sexual contact pool of homosexuals is remarkably confined. That is, gay men usually have sex with gay men. Of course, epidemiological studies have shown us that many men who don't identify as ""gay"" still engage in sex with men. So in public health, we use the term ""MSM"" meaning ""men who have sex with men.""\n\nSo within the MSM population, why is HIV so prevalent? Because you start with one guy, and he gives it to his partner, who gives it to another partner and so forth. If they're not having sex with women* then it stays in the MSM community. If you stay in that partner pool, your chances are much higher that you will find a partner who has HIV because the population is disproportionately more infected than the rest of the population as a whole. If you have sex with more people with HIV, then you stand more chances of getting the virus, too.\n\n* there are MSMW, meaning they secretly have sex with men, but then go home to their wives and girlfriends, have sex and pass HIV to them. this is a growing problem in African-American communities (who call it ""keeping it on the down-low""), and it is a growing problem in India.\n\nAnyway, back on topic. Gay penetrative sex is risky in general. The rectum is lined with delicate tissue that tears easily. During vigorous sex, the tears that form can absorb the virus particles that are released in the seminal fluid. That's how gay men usually pick up HIV, although ""tops"" (insertive partners) can get HIV, too, because the urethra is lined with tissue simliar to the rectum.\n\nAdd risky behavior to the biological disadvantage. Many gay men have multiple partners. Many gay men also have anonymous partners. It doesn't matter what orientation you are: if you have sex with a lot of people, and a lot of strangers, you are endangering yourself!!! Crystal meth and Viagra are being used as party drugs now, so you get lots of high guys having anonymous sex with loads of people in a single night. When you're high, you forget to use condoms. A lot of HIV prevention strategies aimed at gay communities revolves around drug prevention in order to address this problem.\n\nLast point I want to make is the cohort effect. AIDS has been around since 1978. But retroviral drugs have been around since 1995. When HIV+ people started taking them, AIDS deaths declined. before that, you had lots of young gay men dying off in drove. Now, it doesn't happen so much. Gay men who are coming of age today probably know plenty of people with HIV, but because not as many people are getting AIDS, there's no imminent or perceivable danger. They don't believe the threat is there, so they keep doing risky stuff, then they get HIV and not realize the consequences.\n\nAnyway, that's as many HIV MSM issues I can address right now. Hope that was more than thorough."	Health

"What is a  ""NOTICE OF DISCOVERY"" as in the legal paperwork filed ...? . AFTER SOMEONE IS ARRESTED? THEY ARE ALREADY IN JAIL BUT THE PUBLIC DEFENDER OR SOMEBODY, THEY FILED A ""NOTICE OF DISCOVERY"" WHAT EXACTLY IS IT AND DOES IT INVOLVE OTHER PEOPLE? . Laws of Discovery state that both sides in a court case (prosecution and defense in criminal trials or plaintiff and defendant in civil trials) have the right to see each other's evidence.  In other words, there can be no suprise evidence, because each side must show EVERYTHING they have, generally in a judge's presence.\n\nA Notice of Discovery is an official document for one side to let the other side know that they have evidence, so that they may arrange an Evidentiary Hearing with the judge, so that they may show all evidence to each other, and the judge can decide if it is admissable in court.  If there has already been a primary Evidenciary Hearing, a Notice of Discovery simply lets the other side know that they have found more evidence, and they must arrange with a judge to see the new evidence.\n_______________________________________________________\n\nA Notice to Compel depends on what they are compelling.  It generally means though (in the case of Notice to Compel Apperance) that they are sending a notice to let someone know they have been identified as a key witness, and that they better get thier behind down to testify.  Some people refuse to testify, and a Notice to Compel can basically say ""get down here or we'll arrest you.""\n\nThey can also file notice to compel someone to do something.  For example, they can file a Notice to Compel the prosecution to put together thier trial more quickly, or compel someone to perform an examination or inspection, so that it can be used as evidence.  Or they can have a Notice To Compel the defense to come to the Evidenciary Hearing after a Notice of Discovery has been filed."	Politics & Government

"Can I use an attorney to take a deposition in my state to be used in a court case in another state? . I have an ex that lives in the state where we got divorced.  I'm being sued in that state by him.  I need to use some witnesses in my state, but can't afford to have them go that many miles to testify on my behalf.  My attorney in the state where the case is to be heard recommends he come down and take a deposition from the 2 professionals.  Does anyone know if an attorney in my state can take the deposition from the 2 witnesses and send the answers to my attorney in the state of the court case? . Technically, this depends on the law of the state the case is filed in (""forum state"").  Still, I think most states would apply the same general rules.\n\nIt's totally okay to take an out-of-state deposition.  In fact, if a witness won't agree to come to the forum state voluntarily, this is usually the way you have to proceed.  The attorney who takes the deposition doesn't have to be the one who is representing you in the forum state; he or she could be hired just for this one task.\n\nA problem arises only if your ex objects that taking the deposition out of state would be burdensome or oppressive.  For example, he could argue that it will be expensive for him to fly his attorney to the deposition.\n\nThen, it would be up to the court to decide if the cost of the deposition is worth the benefit of the deposition.  It doesn't have to just allow or forbid the deposition; for example, it might allow the deposition, on condition that you pay your ex's attorney's airfare.\n\nP.S.  Ignore caffeyw.

As I've learned on a question of my own, you cannot expect a real answer 'cause we don't know how you guys even broke up. We don't know who dumped who and how are things between you two now.\n\nThe truth is probably this, assuming that I have a real insight of the situation from your question: You are still a princess to him and he still finds you beautiful. But you are not HIS princess anymore. He surely does care.\n\nThe fact remains - he is trying to destroy your self confidence so you don't find somebody else. It is a cruel tactic, but the man still cares and he's out of ideas. Talk with him.	Family & Relationships

"Any idea where i can get the same guitar as one of the Kasabian band members uses? I believe it is an Epiphone . I would like to get my dad it for Christmas as a surprise as ive heard him talking about it. I think its black and is an Epiphone Les Paul. Can anyone clarify the exact type? He said it costs around Â£250 - Â£280. Thanks. . I don't know what guitar Kasabian uses, but if it's a Les Paul, you've got some options.\n\nLes Pauls were originally made by Gibson, but Epiphone models are much cheaper and of slightly poorer quality.\n\nLes Pauls come in many different variaties: There's the Epiphone Les Paul Standard, which will run you about $640 USD (about Â£320, I'm guessing). But theres also the Les Paul Custom, which is about Â£500. Then there's the Les Paul junior, which sounds a little more ""rock n' roll, for Â£100, but it's pretty ugly (in my opinion).\n\nThere's more beyond that, but those are the most common models."

Minimum wage hasn't been raised in 10 years. When will the government increase it again? .  . Hopefully soon. Everything is going up except wages. People can not afford to pay bills and eat too. Utility bills have more than tripled, gasoline has even done more than that, groceries are high, but people can not afford hardly anything if they are working for minimum wage. It's terrible that our country can help other countries but can not and will not help their own. Unemployment is higher than it has ever been and the only people making good money are politicians, people in the entertainment business, and the people who already have it. I don't see things getting any better soon. I just wish there were a way to open the eyes of the people who could change the problems that the lower and middle income people face.

Watching the news now. This just said about the Insurgents. They're not out to Win. Will We Win? . The news just stated the Insurgents know they can't win against the United States so they will pick off and kill 4 to 10 USA Military members everyday until the USA gets tired of it and  them pulls out. So the Insurgents ( According to the News ) will try and wait us out. So I ask all here. Will the United States endure even if it takes another 15 to 20 years? Some say it will be up to the new President ( Who will be elected in 2008 ) to make a final decision. ( Jeb Bush??) . In this sort of situation the insurgents don't have to win they just have to be.\nThey are well embedded in the population and rely on them for support.\nThe military power will use ever increasing methods of oppression to try to defeat them which will just increase their support.\nEventually the military power will lose the political will to continue because events elsewhere will become more important.\nThis happened with the British in Cyprus and to a certain extent with the British in Ireland but in the latter case it was only the support of the American people that enabled the I.R.A. terrorists to be so successful for so long.\nOnce 9/11 had happened that support melted away as the Americans got a taste of their own medecine.

For instance, I know that how a child is raised is also a MAJOR factor, but lets say a child is concieved during a one night stand and the parents get married and stay together during the childs development VS. a couple that has been together a while and is truly in love and then concieves and also stays together during the duration of the childs development.  I guess this would also fall along the lines of DNA such as a child is born gay, do emotions have any part of the development of sperm, ie. i am in love and in a good mood i produce good sperm VS. i am pissed off and depressed making bad sperm, or is it 100% completely genetic? .

"what are platos attacks on poetry and drama ? i want a discussion? . i want a discussion . Platon basically believes that the only ones who have access to the truth ( held within the world of Ideas) are the philosophers. Poets can't know this truth because although their work is an expression of beauty, and may contain in itself the germs of this truth, the poets themselves are unaware of it. The ancient view on poets (and creators of literary work in general) is that they are possessed by a muse, that they only pass on what the muse ""whispers"" to them in a state of inspiration. Therefore for Plato poets can only be used as tools of somehow manipulating the masses. This is their role in Plato's Utopian society. If you want to know more about it I suggest you read the dialogs Phaedros and The Republic. It is also interesting to compare Plato's belief with that of Aristotle, his disciple.\nI hope this helps :)"	Education & Reference

"Why does mail from social security never have a postmark? . I went through old papers recently and noticed this.Also,i noticed that mail from a local town had that towns postmark{a small local town}but when mail is sent from my small local town,it has to go fifty miles away before its sent to a place only two miles away where you mailed it.If I send a letter to my local town,why can`t the local postoffice postmark it and send it down the road with the rest of the mail??Why does it have to go round the world to get next door?? . Social security, along with every Federal government agency uses what is called ""penalty mail"" (penalty because there is a penalty for personal use). This is not pre-paid, so there is no postmark, but the agency does end up paying USPS for it. As for why your mail goes elsewhere first, it would be impossible to answer without knowing what city you are in, but I imagine it is because the post office at your small town does not have a sorting facility, so they send all of the mail they receive to the nearest sorting facility before it comes back."

"What can you tell me about retirement in Ontario (or all of Canada if it's standard)? . Specifically, what is the retirement age? Is it fixed? Also, how much of a pension do you get, or if that's not fixed, how is it calculated? I can't find anyone who seems to know the answers to these questions.\n\nThanks in advance!\n\n(note: I know I've misplaced this question but it was the closest I could get!) . There is no law or regulation imposed by governments that require workers to retire at 65. Rather, in provinces where mandatory retirement is still a reality, there is no law preventing an organization from forcing someone to retire at 65. (Ontario is, however, planning to legislate against mandatory retirement. For a look across provincial jurisdictions, visit www.hrreporter.com, select ""Advanced Search,"" and enter article #3461.) \n\nYour pension is based on a number of individual variables.\n\nGo to www.gov.on.ca for more information and phone numbers you can call."

"Are we genetically predisposed to dislike our siblings? . ...something along the lines of sibling rivalry? . no, but we tend to be less polite/respectful (e.g. in cases of conflict) to relatives than strangers. \nEverybody shares with their full siblings about 50% genetic material. So theoretically if you ensure the survival of two of your siblings, it just as good (for the genes) than if you survive yourself. Therefore you should be inclined to help them and defend them against outsiders. \nBecause of that, they (or you) should also be less likely to get totally pissed off by you and leave you to your fate, than they would with strangers (strangers would not share many genes with you, so their genes don't survive at a higher frequency if they help the stranger).\n\nThat's why you can ""risk"" to be less polite to siblings than to strangers, because they are less likely to retaliate by cutting you completely off and not help you ever again. After all, in a way, they have a permanent investment in you. \nOf course it's not that simple, cause we are not machines, but on average, over generations...\n\nat least such results have been found to be true for some social animal species (less upsetting to everybodies feeling to investigate), but the principle should be exactly the same.

There we did puja, sang songs, chanted mantras, but mostly we read and discussed the Bhagavad Gita (hence the name of the group). \n\nIt is the most profound book I've read.

How do electronic diodes work? .  . Semi-conductor diodes have a non-linear and asymmetric current flow response to applied voltage. Basically they allow much greater current to flow in one direction over the other. It is based on some pretty heavy physics, but can be modeled by considering the junction between N type doped semiconductor and P type doped semiconductor where the majority carriers on one side are positive, and the majority carriers on the other are negative. When you bias the junction in a certain way the carriers on each side of the junction cancel each other out and you get very limited current flow. When you bias the diode the other way the carriers donât cancel and you get much higher current flow for the same applied voltage.\n\nI assume you don't want to know about vacuum tube diodes of old. They are based on a very different physical property.\n\nHope this helps.	Science & Mathematics

Help!! My new neighbor is playing loud music. What are my realistic options? . I own an end-unit 2 story townhouse in the suburbs on a quiet cul-de-sac.

Ask her to turn it down.\n\nIf this doesn't work and you do not get a positive response, call your local police department and ask what ordinances there are on noise and loud music.  If there are laws (be aware that this is going to piss off your neighbor), you can ask the police to speak with her.  Normally, they will warn her the first time.  \n\nIf she turns it up after they leave.... which inconsiderate people do, you can call them again.

Clinton lied and hurt his wife, another president lied hurt millions,how does this work? .  . I assume you are trying to smear Bush and lift Clinton by trying to draw a comparison to Clinton's Perjury (which is a FELONY, by the way) and the War in Iraq.\n\nYour implied argument is invalid, however. When did Bush lie? \n\nWMD's? The intelligence may have been inaccurate, but there was agreement that Saddam very likely had WMD's between USA, Britain, Germany and The UN/IAEA. Is it that hard to believe that a government that trained its scientists on tactics to hide illegal weapons programs from UN Inspectors would move his WMD's to a sympathetic neighbor in the face of a well telegraphed move against it?\n\nKatrina? Watch the videos again. Add to it the videos of Gov. Blanco informing Bush that the levies were holding AFTER THEY HAD ALREADY FAILED. Then you will have the whole story and realize Bush didn't lie.\n\nRemember, lying is a deliberate action of deception.

why do people always think cutting is a scuicide attemp or attention getting plan???? . i have been cutting and everyone seems to think that it is for attention the only treasion i say anything on her is B/C i dobnt know any of u.........i just like it . most people associate it with suicide because a lot of people only know cutting as slitting your wrists, the maximum form of cutting on the wrists. most people cant understand how hard it actually is to do that (at ur wrists u hav tendons to go through) and that a lot of cutters dont even go that deep. also, cutting anywhere else is seen as a baby step towards slitting your wrists since it isnt as severe and as common. personally i dont want to stop or get caught so  i cut on my thighs or ribs, it hurts more and gives a better after effect (i can actually feel something!) and since no one sees no one thinks it just attention getting. but when i used to cut on my wrists i did it and didnt let anyone see, if sumeone is seeing and saying things to u then maybe u need to hide it better. i like the feelings i get, becuz i get to feel sumthing rather than nuthing, but if u want to continue cutting and not get sent away i would suggest hiding it better. people cant understand the feelings that mean cutting without suicide and they cant comprehend wanting to cut so they throw it into a suicide attempt, and letting people see can b a call for attention and u dont realize it now. so hide it or consider stopping, but i cant reach since i cut. i just advise u to hide it better and no one will b able to say anything...

How do you convert compound interest to simple interest or vice versa? .  . Compound interest is R=((1+r)^n)-1. Simple interest is R=r*n. If you know r and n then you can calculate either one. If you know n and R then you can reverse the formulas to find one or the other.\nFor example, 1% per month is 12% simple and 12.68% compounded. 12% p.a. compounded monthly is 0.949% per month, which is 11.39% simple.

For that reason it might be better to do it the second night, when the pressure is less. But, that is just a general guideline. If you are both feeling it, go ahead. You will probably know what to do, to go ahead or to postpone. Just trust your instincts, and the most important thing, as strange as it may sound, simply try to relax. In a relaxed state you are more likely to reach a good decision, whichever it may be.\nHope that helps	Family & Relationships
If a spleen is damaged due to a car accident and is bleeding can it heal itself? .  . That is the new theory:\n\nNot long ago nearly all cases of splenic trauma were treated by laparoscopy, opening the abdomen, and by splenectomy, the surgical removal of the spleen. This approach resulted from the difficulty in assessing the severity of the injury, the potential dangers of shock and death, and the beliefs that the spleen healed poorly and that it was not an important organ. Nowadays, improved techniques of diagnosis and monitoring, as well as understanding that removal of the spleen creates future risk of a lowered capacity to fight infection has modified treatment approaches. Research over the past two decades has shown that the spleen has high healing potential, and confirmed that children are more susceptible to infection after splenectomy (post splenectomy sepsis, PSS). PSS has a mortality rate of over 50% and standard procedure now avoids splenectomy as much as possible. Adult splenic trauma is treated by splenectomy more often than children's; for unknown reasons, the adult spleen more frequently spontaneously ruptures after injury. Adults are also less susceptible to PSS.   http://www.lifesteps.com/gm/Atoz/ency/splenic_trauma.jsp	Health

what is facilitated diffusion? .  . Solutes that are too polar or highly charged to diffuse through the lipid bilayer and are too big to diffuse through membrane channels can cross the plasma membrane by facilated difussion.In this process, a solute binds to a specific transporter on one side of the membrane and is released on the other side after the transporter undergoes a changhe in shape.\n\nLike diffusion, facilitated diffusion is a passive process.The net result of facilitated diffusion is movement down a concentration gradient.The solute binds more often to the transporter on the side of the membrane with a higher concentration of solute.Once the concentration is the same on the both sides of the membrane,solute molecules bind to the transporter on the cystolic side and move out the extracellular side and move into the cytosol.The rate of facilitated diffusion(how quickly it occurs) is determined by the stepness of the concentration gradient across the membrane.\n\nThe number of transporters available in a plasma membrane places an upper limit,called the transport maximum,on the rate at which facilitated diffusion can occur.Once all the transporters are occupied, the transport maximum is reached, and further increase in the concentration gradient does not increase the rate of facilitated diffusion.Thus,much like a completely saturated sponge can absorb no more water,the process of facilitated diffusion exhibits saturation.\n\nHope this helps you.Please check my spelling too.I may misspelled some words.So many too typed.No time to check it.\n(^^o)/	Science & Mathematics

"Why in Judeo Christian mythology does God burn people to death? Do people still believe God is love? . What the Bible says about Burning People to Death\nSome crimes are so heinous that the guilty must be burned to death. \n(Like when a man has sex with his wife and mother-in-law, the daughter of a priest behaves like a whore, or someone touches the accursed thing.) \n\n""If a man take a wife and her mother, it is wickedness: they shall be burnt with fire, both he and they; that there be no wickedness among you."" -- Leviticus 20:14 \n\n""And the daughter of any priest, if she profane herself by playing the whore, she profaneth her father: she shall be burnt with fire."" -- Leviticus 21:9 \n\n""Tamar thy daughter in law hath played the harlot; and also, behold, she is with child by whoredom. And Judah said, Bring her forth, and let her be burnt."" -- Genesis 38:24 \n\n""He that is taken with the accursed thing shall be burnt with fire, he and all that he hath. ... And Joshua ... took Achan ... and his sons, and his daughters ... And all Israel stoned him with stones, and burned them with fire."" -- Joshua 7:15, 24-25 \n\nSometimes God burns people to death. \n(Like when they complain too much, burn incense without a license, dabble in astrology, or make God angry or jealous or something. And sometimes God burns people to identify a prophet or to identify himself, and sometimes for no reason at all.) \n\n""And when the people complained, it displeased the LORD: and the LORD heard it and his anger was kindled; and the fire of the LORD burnt among them, and consumed them that were in the uttermost parts of the camp."" -- Numbers 11:1 \n\n""And there came out a fire from the LORD, and consumed the two hundred and fifty men that offered incense."" -- Numbers 16:35 \n\n""They have moved me to jealousy with that which is not God ... For a fire is kindled in mine anger, and shall burn unto the lowest hell, and shall consume the earth with her increase, and set on fire the foundations of the mountains. ... They shall be burnt with hunger, and devoured with burning heat, and with bitter destruction: I will also send the teeth of beasts upon them, with the poison of serpents of the dust."" -- Deuteronomy 32:21-24 \n\n""Thou shalt make them as a fiery oven in the time of thine anger: the LORD shall swallow them up in his wrath, and the fire shall devour them."" -- Psalm 21:9 \n\n""Let now the astrologers, the stargazers, the monthly prognosticators, stand up, and save thee from these things that shall come upon thee. Behold, they shall be as stubble; the fire shall burn them; they shall not deliver themselves from the power of the flame."" -- Isaiah 47:13-14 \n\n""If I be a man of God, then let fire come down from heaven, and consume thee and thy fifty. And there came down fire from heaven, and consumed him and his fifty."" -- 2 Kings 1:10, 12 \n\n""Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; As the vine tree among the trees of the forest, which I have given to the fire for fuel, so will I give the inhabitants of Jerusalem. And I will set my face against them; they shall go out from one fire, and another fire shall devour them; and ye shall know that I am the LORD. -- Ezekiel 15:6-7 \n\n""Therefore hath the curse devoured the earth, and they that dwell therein are desolate: therefore the inhabitants of the earth are burned, and few men left."" -- Isaiah 24:6 \n\n""And the people shall be as the burnings of lime: as thorns cut up shall they be burned in the fire."" -- Isaiah 33:12 \n\n""I will cause an alarm of war to be heard in Rabbah of the Ammonites; and it shall be a desolate heap, and her daughters shall be burned with fire."" -- Jeremiah 49:2 \n\nAnd God will burn most people forever in hell after they die. \n\n""If a man abide not in me, he is cast forth as a branch, and is withered; and men gather them, and cast them into the fire, and they are burned."" -- John 15:6 \n\n""The Lord Jesus ... in flaming fire taking vengeanc .

The NYPD fired 51 bullets to kill one guy? . Do they need some marksmanship practice or what?  It is my understanding that it was very close range.  Or is the 9mm caliber just too small of a bullet to do significant damage?  Should the Police upgrade to .45 caliber? . The real question here was caliber of bullet.\n\nJust like the basic round in the army is a 5.56mm, and most would argue thats too light of a round to be effective against the Ak's of the world, i think the 9mm is the perfect round that preserves the ideals the police shoudl strive for.\n\na 45 or even a 40 cal would be nice, but its the 9mm that requires control of weapon control of mind.  We dont want our officers blowing away everythign that comes there way.  We shoot with intent on subdoeing the perpetrator, not straight killing him.\n\nYes, it does pose a risk for our officers, and puts them in more harms way when gang members carrying around high powered weapons that inflict more damage then our officers.\nBut our officers need to use restraint.  thats the key.  And the 9mm helps keep that ideal for restraint ever present.\n\nNow, whether or not I agree on 51 shots being fired.\nCouldnt say.  One officer reloaded 3 times - that would be 46 shots from one officer wouldnt it 1 chambered 15 per mag.\n\nWith hindsight, and the fact that none of us were there, would be difficult to truly judge the situation.\nBut I say, when are we going to support out officers' judgement under fire, just as we should support our troops for the terrible jobs they must endure.\n\nUntil you have put yourself in harms way in that way, I dont think anyone can truly judge the situation correctly.\n\nMe personally, if someone attacked me, or the guy fighting next to me, with a vehicle, theyd get every round I had.\n\nTheres reports of a 4th guy getting away.\nWouldnt it be funny, if he showed a gun, or he was the one that presented a threat and forced the shooting somehow.\n\nI spit on all those people who are quick to judge the situation without having ever served in the military or as a police officer, and who fail to sympathize with our boys in blue, who have the 2nd toughest job in all the world.\n\n1st would be kicking in doors as the #1 2 3 or 4th man and doing that over and over again for a year, or more.\n\nThis is a good debate question, but you havent earned a say until youve served.\n\nMy opinion anyways!

WHICH 1 Is THE BEST? . I like porsches more than any other car but considering it's price and lack of speed and hp compared ford and ferraris i am beginning to wonder which one is better a ferrari 430&360 or a mustang gt or a porsche 911/boxer/turbo series or a top end mercades and also would a lambo be as comfortable as a mercades? . Out of these, even though I hate Ferrari as a F1 team, I have a bit of inclination towards their road cars and especially towards the F430. I really like that car. And I think it might be the best one of the ones you mentioned.\n\nA Porsche... maybe the GT3 RS, but that's not quite a 100% road car. Top-end Mercedes... maybe a AMG-powered one. I'm not taking into account the Mercedes-McLaren SLR and the Porsche Carrera GT. Those are top-end supercars.	Sports

How do you install a slave hard drive? . I have a windows 2000 professional and I can't install it, how do you install it? . the jumper pins on the drive you want to be your slave must be set to slave. look at the sticker on the drive. It should have a diagrahm showing standalone/cable select(default), slave, and master. the jumper pin is located beside where the IDE cable plugs into the drive in the back. You shouldn't have to change the pin on your existing drive, we are going to use the cable select feature. Now, disconnect the IDE cable from your existing drive if it doesn't have two 30 pin connections. If it does, you can use that cable, otherwise use the new IDE cable that came with the new drive. (you'll have to dissconect the old IDE from the motherboard if using new cable)Now hook your existing drive to the 30 pin connector in the middle of the cable, and piggy back your slave to the 30 pin connector at the end of the cable....that's it, turn it on. Operating system doesn't matter. The board BIOS should auto detect the new drive. If not, go into the BIOS setup screen and set primary slave to auto detect. (enter bios setup by hitting either DEL or ESC right at startup) let me know if it works! P.S. pay attention to the red stripe on the cable, and what side it is on going into the motherboard and your existing drive, if you try to hook it up backwards, you may bend the pins, and then your screwed.

Physics Help? . What is the speed of a wave whose frequency and wavelength are 500 Hz and 0.5 m, respectively? . Like arbiter00.. said, the speed of a wave is the wave's wavelength times (multiplied with) the frequency at which the wave is traveling.  Wavelength is usually characterized by the Greek letter Lamda and f for frequency.  \n\nThe answer to your question is 500(Hz)x.5(m)= 250(m&#92;s).\n\nThe seconds (s) in the unit meters per second comes from the inverse of T (time in s) which f is equal to.  Hence, you have meters (m) per second (s)!	Science & Mathematics

"Are mainstream movies attempting to be Cult? . With cult movies there as always been one key factor. You can't attempt to be cult or it just won't work.\n\nAre recent movies like Running Scared and Domino (and many others) really attempting to thrive off the cult factor?\n\nHeres a definition of a Cult Movie for those who don't know:\nA cult film is a movie that attracts a small but devoted group of obsessive fans or one that has remained popular over successive years amongst a small group of followers. Often the film failed to achieve mainstream success on its original release, but this is not always the case. Sometimes the audience response to a cult film is somewhat different to what was intended by the filmmakers, although usually a film that becomes ""cult"" started out with unusual elements or subject matter. . It is almost impossible to predict what will catch the fancy of the obsessive few. I think that most mainstream movies are simply trying to make money now. Of course, some of them are spectacular failures, but somebody thought that they had a good idea."	Entertainment & Music

"what does sexual intercourse mean? .  . Sexual intercourse, specifically coitus, is the human form of copulation. The term sexual intercourse refers to a wider range of sexual activities than the term coitus, which only refers to male-female genital sex. See Human sexual behavior for a discussion of the broader sense of sexual intercourse and list of sexual positions for the wide variety of sexual activities that exist. See the terms frot for male-male genital sex and tribadism for female-female genital sex. ""Genital sex"" as used here refers to genito-genital sex, among BDSM/fetish practitioners the term ""genital sex"" can mean any sex involving the genitals including anal, oral, manual etc., as opposed to those based on toys, costumes or fantasies.\n\nCoitus may be preceded by foreplay, which leads to sexual arousal of the partners, resulting in the erection of the penis and natural lubrication of the vagina.\n\nTo engage in sexual intercourse, the erect penis is inserted into the vagina and one or both of the partners move their hips to move the penis backward and forward inside the vagina to cause friction, without ever fully removing the penis. In this way, they stimulate themselves and each other until orgasm and ejaculation are achieved. Penetration with the penis is also known as intromission, or by the Latin name immissio penis."

Stopping illegal immigration wrong? . The point is, no matter what, we must close the border down either with a wall or have the cost guard down there. Take care of the flood first. Then take care of the legalization issue. Its a two step progress is it not? We have to crawl before we walk don't we? . It is the right, duty and responsibility of governments to ensure that its own citizens are 'adequately protected' from illegal immigrations.\n\nFrom our country's experience we have set periodic deadlines for illegal aliens to give themselves up to be repatriated to their counrty of origins, or face arrest and subsequent punishment of the country's laws which includes jail sentence and/or caning. In addition employers face substantial monetary fines for every illegal alien they employ. These measures were effective in reducing a significant total of illegals.\n\nAmerica is not doing enough to protect its own people from within. Illegal aliens bring diseases, cultures/practices that may be offensive/illegal and pose new dangers upsetting existing American communities and neighbourhoods. Why should the American citizens have to tolerate these additional dangers to their lives and peace-of-mind? I just cannot understand why the US government is doing so little/nothing to address this URGENT problem?!! Americans must exert pressure on the authorities, make loud noises by holding peaceful protests IF they want to wake up the government.	Politics & Government
