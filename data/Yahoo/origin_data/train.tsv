how soon does sperm die after being in contact with the air? . ok my gf is really worried she is pregnate. we never had sex but i did cum, then clean up and then a little later i fingered her. ok i want to know if she could get pregnate from that and what the chances of that would be . Semen will keep spermatozoa alive for up to several days...under perfect circumstances. Once the semen dries out it cannot keep the cell walls of the spermatozoa intact and they die. Sometimes light, heat, cold as well as chemicals can kill spermatozoa while the semen is still wet.\n\nReally safe sex needs to be safer....in your case.\n\nAnd not only from the pregnancy standpoint.

"need help in building my web site? . I already have a domain name canvascare.biz and I am paying monthly for a Yahoo site.  I need to know where and how to bigin to build my website. . We used EZLAVA to create our web site.  A friend referred us to EZLAVA, saying it was what they used and they loved it.  So we tried it and agree, it's awesome.  \n\nWith the program, you don't have to know HTML, PHP, ASP, or JavaScript.  It does all that for you via a central admin that appears when you click on an object (images, text, forms, etc.) to make changes.\n\nWe started on a blank edit page (studio area), and uploaded our own graphics into the database.  Using the program, we set up one main web page template using our graphics. We were able to drop all of our graphics onto the page at once.  Then we set up our links and saved the page as a ""custom template"".  EZLAVA calls them custom templates.  They are pages or content layouts that can be added to multiple pages over and over.  It saved us a bunch of time. By creating one web page with all your page links and graphics, you can apply that layout to any web page you need.  And those templates can be locked.  So when you make a change to the template, it makes those changes site wide.\n\nIt also has a dynamic shopping cart builder, form builder, html text editor, and every other feature you'd need.  We use it in tandem with Photoshop to do all of our web stuff.  But they do have web site designs already within the system.  So if someone wanted to use them, they're free.  They also have tons of clipart photos and graphics for use on your web pages.\n\nOverall, it's really easy to use.  We found the EZLAVA software definitely worth it!"	Computers & Internet

She appealed her conviction on the basis of freedom of expression. \n \n \nQuestion Presented \nWere the confiscated materials protected by the First Amendment? (May evidence obtained through a search in violation of the Fourth Amendment be admitted in a state criminal proceeding?) \n \n \nConclusion \nThe Court brushed aside the First Amendment issue and declared that ""all evidence obtained by searches and seizures in violation of the Constitution is, by [the Fourth Amendment], inadmissible in a state court."" Mapp had been convicted on the basis of illegally obtained evidence. This was an historic -- and controversial -- decision. It placed the requirement of excluding illegally obtained evidence from court at all levels of the government. The decision launched the Court on a troubled course of determining how and when to apply the exclusionary rule."	Politics & Government

how do i make money like bill gates? .  . First, you have to have something that someone wants, like an operating system when no other operating system is available. Then, you get a good lawyer to invent a way of charging for every installation of that operating system on computers that would have SOME kind of operating system anyway, so you have to make sure that the company selling the computers has a reputation which is impeccable and all the dummies buying their equipment are totally dependent on ONE style of doing things.\nOnce you establish a dependency in the business world, then you can branch out to employees and their friends, who all want to do what their peers are doing, regardless of how poor the quality is, or how much time they spend on upgrades and rebooting their computers. \nIn other words, you have to learn to convert people's lives and time into cashflow through a lawyer. Or just hold their livelihoods as hostages via an entrenched dogmatic system of purchasing agents and accountants who won't let you change how businesses use information technology.

Does answering a question first increase your odds of getting best answer? .  . It shouldn't, but people are lazy, and if there are a lot of answers, they may not read down to the later answers.  I think the difference between first and, say, 10th, is minor if the asker does the choosing.  But when it comes to answers selected by voters, I know that I have had more best answers when I was in the first few than when mine is further down.  That's especially true when my answer is on the second or third page.  I *know* that I have had the best, most specific answer sometimes, but another answer, higher on the list, is chosen as best.  I am pretty sure that voters never bothered to read every answer before voting.	Family & Relationships

I would say it all depends on the situation. Since you all have so much history and two beautiful daughters, I would think it'd be better to get back together, but that may just be me. Don't do what people on here say, just take the advice and build off of it. Maybe he got scared for some reason and pulled out of the relationship because he didn't know what to do. If you love him and you know he loves you, then I would give it a second chance. If it was meant to be, it will be. I know that's probably the worst advice line I could give you, but I've found out that it is pretty true. No matter what happens, I promise you both will be okay.

i had a crown put in and the tooth rotted under it, should this have happened? .  . It does happen... it isn't completely common but not quite rare. When you have a tooth crowned your gum is still vulnarable to bacteria and other debris. Sometimes you might even have a very small part of enamel uncovered near the gum line (you might not even be able to see it but bcteria can get in the smallest of space) and if the right bacteria get in there and start easting away at your tooth then soon your whole tooth will rot away... your insurance should cover the cost of fixing this as long as your going to the same dentist that put the crown on.... \n\nCall the dental office and request your possibilites of correction...they will tell you if you will have any out of pocket expense for fixing this problem... but dont let it go because after that tooth is completely decayed the bacteria will spread to the other teeth near by..\n\nLet me guess it was one of your back molars right? That is the typical tooth this type of thing happens too... as crowns are harder to fit perfectly back there.	Health

"I suffer from nystagmus, due to multiple sclerosis.  Anyone else have this problem""? .  . I know some one who had suffered from this problem, his was also due to M.S.. His eyes made small involuntary movements, but the condition seems to have disappeared. He is taking a virtually unknown prescription drug that is working miracles in people with M.S.and other autoimmune disorders, it is known as Low Dose Naltrexone. Doctor Bernard Bihari of New York City has been working with this drug since the 80's. and it is just now starting to get some attention. The second annual Low Dose Naltrexone Conference was held in Washington this year, you can hear the lectures off the web site. Because the monthly treatment cost is only $38 u.s. per patient don't expect any drug company involvement any time soon. A few private clinical trails have commenced world wide and the preliminary results are all quite promising. If you have not heard of this little know treatment yet. try clicking on the link below and start your research, it might be a viable option for you.\n\nAnother very important avenue you should explore when treating M.S. is neurotoxin damage both dietary and environmental. Things like monosodium glutamate, aspartame, heavy metals,food additives, preservatives, fungal and bacterial mycotoxins maybe causing or exacerbating your condition. Many M.S. sufferers have made their symptoms disappear by eliminating the above mentioned poisons from their body.\n\nBecause most packaged foods have M.S.G. (under a disguised category such as modified corn starch, spices, yeast extract, hydrolyzed vegetable protein etc.) I would stick to fresh organically raised foods, stay away from anything packaged . Drink clean distilled or R.O. water only.\n\nGet checked for heavy metal contamination, have both Hair analysis and Urinalysis through Calcium EDTA provocation. There is a possibility that you have mercury poisoning, from either vaccination, or through food consumption. If you are positive for heavy metals, then chelation therapy should be explored. Dr Gary Gordon of Tempe Arizona is the expert here. He also works with Dr Amy Yasko that specializes in patients with neurological disorders.\n\nTo check for biotoxin exposure I would recommend Dr.Shoemakerâs website listed below. On his site there is information on doing a VCS (visual contrast sensitivity) test. This doctor specializes on treating people with biotoxin-induced illness.\n\nSome final recommendations I have for you is to look into: enzyme therapy such as Wobenzym N, (it is very popular in Europe especially Germany), Vitamin D therapy and Histamine therapy \n\nAlthough the doctors mentioned below are available for phone consultations, Dr Bihari will be extremely difficult to speak with, instead I would call one of the compounding pharmacies listed on the web site and ask for names of doctors in your area that might be sending prescriptions to them.\n\nI have confidence that you can beat this thing, or put it into remission, all the best to you!"

Can the chemicals in a pool age or damage your face skin? . like it damages your hair?  Can it prematurely age your face irreparably? . Chlorine has bleach in it. No one would ever think of washing his or her hair in bleach, but that's what you're exposing yourself to every time you  jump in the pool. I don't know about premature aging, but chlorine dries the skin severely and therefore, extra care should be taken before and after you swim.\n\nBefore I swim, I put a light coating of conditioner in my dry hair. Then I put on a cap. This protects my hair somewhat from the damaging effects of chlorine. If I'm swimming outdoor in the daytime,  I always, always wear sunscreen. Be sure not to miss the back of your body, since you tend to expose your posterior to the sun when swimming. This is the single most important thing you can do to protect yourself from longterm damage (not to mention skin cancer).\n\nAfter swimming, I wash my hair and condition it immediately. I shower to get all the sunscreen off, then while I'm still drying off, I put lotion on my entire body and moisturizer on my face.	Sports

Is this a form of genetic inherited asbergers syndrome? . In this family (several generations) about 2/3 of the girls have psychological problems but are quite creative and 50% of the boys have a slight to moderate learning disability and problems with balance. Those not afflicted seem okay. Both sexes seem to carry the genetic problem that randomly affects any children they have. The boys affected have moonish looking faces but not as severe as downs children. Could this be Asbergers Syndrome or are there any other ideas?  I thought it must be some form of high-level autism, which is why I thought about Asbergers. With so many affected it must have a genetic component. My fear is or course for the future siblings of the current generation and what to tell them about procreation risks. Genetic profiling has been suggested but I know of no definitive genetic test for Asbergers or any way of prenatal determination of this. . This is WAY to complex for laymen to comment on on-line...would be just guesses anyway.  You need to speak to your family doctor about a consult with a genetecist.  There may be no test for Ausberger's, but, then you don't know that is what it is.  Before having more children, please ask to speak to a genetics counsellor for your peace of mind.

Getting advice usually means you have to come to the realization that you can't handle a situation on your own. That can be very humbling. It's easier for someone to see wrong in someone else than it is for a person to see wrong in themselves. And sometimes, you have to be truthful with yourself about something that may not be right for you, yet you still want to do it. It also takes change on your part, which can be one of the HARDEST things for a person to do. Finally, advice comes from people's experiences. You may not have had experience in that area to know any better how to handle it. Because you haven't had that particular experience, you mat not even know you're handling it in all the wrong ways........	Family & Relationships

if God exists why the world s in such a poor shape. I bulid my house I'l bring the best to it then why god dnt .  . Because He gave us choice and we made the wrong one. I read in a book one very good comparison, it goes something like this - imagine you have a child and that child wants to play outside with his friends. Do you let him go? You let him, but that doesn't mean you're not worried about him and that you're not watching him from the window. Now he may or may not be hurt, that depends on him. If he gets hurt, for example if he falls from the bench, he will learn a lesson and come to you crying for help. Next time he will think twice about it. Now here is what I'm trying to say - we all make our choices, and yes, probably half of them are not God's way of dealing with things, but He is patient and He loves us, just as we love our children. Now everyone needs to come to realize that everything we do is our will, God is here to hug us when we do wrong. If the world is in bad shape, that is because we rule with it badly. But God hasn't left us. Just remember - we all have a choice.	Society & Culture
"How many hate Texas? .  . Texas is definitely a difficult place to live.  I've lived in Chicago, New York, and now Houston and have found that Texans are more selfish, insincere, and egotistical than any other place.\n\nI find this stuff kind of weird:\n-During the olymipics announcers would always add ""...a Texas native"" when commenting on that Chad speed skater guy, but would never mention any other state backgrounds.\n-In the state constitution, it is perfectly leagal for Texas to suseed from the USA.\n-Texans complain about all the illegal Mexicans crossing into America.  Very hypocritical considering Americans stole the land from Mexico in the early 1800's.\n\nEssentially Texas sucks because the people are self-absorbed, close minded, reigious fanatics."

"Why was the U.S. attacked on Se[tember 11 2001? . Im doing this for a reaserch report...opinions are welcome but it would be so much easier for me if u stuck to the facts\nThanx.. . September 11 was not mindless terrorism for terrorism's sake. It was reaction and revenge, even retribution. From the Crusades of the 11th century to the Turkish expansion of the 15th century to the colonial era in the early 20th century, Islam and the West have often battled militarily.\n\nThe anger deepened in the wake of America's support for Israel during the wars of 1967 and 1973, and ever since in its relations with the Palestinians. In September 1982, Israeli troops surrounded the Palestinian refugee camps of Sabra and Chatila in southern Lebanon and stood by while Christian militiamen, over a three-day period, massacred at least 800 people, including women, children and the elderly. The Israeli defense minister who approved the action was Ariel Sharon. The United States provides $3 billion in aid a year to Israel. As the rest of the world well knows, Israel could not survive without US aid. Those Muslims who hate us do so not just because of Sabra and Chatila, but because they blame us for every outrage and brutal act committed by the Israeli government, since we bear a direct responsibility for their survival.\n\n\nAnother fuel source for their hatred is our neglect of the Afghans after the Soviet withdrawal. We supported and trained them while they were fighting the ""red menace"", and then walked away. Walking away from that fractured country after 1989 resulted in the rise of bin Laden and the Taliban. As F. Scott Fitzgerald explained of his characters in ""The Great Gatsby,"" ""They were careless people, Tom and Daisy--they smashed things up and creatures and then retreated back into their money, or their vast carelessness... and let other people clean up the mess.""\n\nThe people who cleaned up the mess left behind in afghanistan were bin Laden and Muslim extremists.\n\nA really good book on this is ""1000 Years for Revenge "" by Peter Lance. Most major libraries will either have it or be able to get it."	Politics & Government

"Old stretch marks? . I have really crap skin and every time my weight changes, eve slightly, I seem to end up with stretch marks. They also tend to be in weird places, including the inside of my upper arms, and behind my knees. The ones behind my knees don't bother me because I always wear long trousers. But I also have them on the inside of both arms, right down to the elbow joint. \n\nThey're old and faded now, silvery white in colour, but I'm still very aware of them and it bothers me a lot. I usually just wear long sleeves, but it's getting into summer now and it's too hot to wear long sleeves.\n\nIs there anything I can do to make them less visible? I use vitamin E rich moisturiser on them every day, and they are, as I said above, silvery white, not red. Would fake tan make a difference? Any suggestions? . I am usually against surgery.  Skin is so important for your health, confidence, and functioning.  \n\nI believe a plastic surgeon would give the best advice.  It may cost a lot, but If this is a problem for you, then you need to weigh the costs vs the benefits.\n\n""Mederma"" is a topical aid for stretch marks, but you faithfully need to apply it 3-5 times a day on the stretch marks.  A one ounce bottle costs around $40.00 USD.  So, if you've got a large area, and you're spreading it 3-5 times a day, you'd be spending a fortune on this topical.\n\nAgain, I think a surgeon is the best solution for long term help."	Health

"Is it legal for police to stop you on the street for no reason and ask for ID? .  . Boy...tough crowd in here.

Is it legal for the police to stop you on the street (in your car, at your home, in the bar, etc.) for no reason?\n\nThe police cannot stop you for no reason.  However, it's entirely possible you don't know what the reason was, or you weren't really ""stopped"" as the law considers it...the word ""stop"" has a very significant legal meaning and what you might think of as being stopped by the police might not be seen that way under the law.  Consensual contacts between the police and citizens take place day and night, 24x7, and are approved of by the courts all the time.    \n\n2.  Can the police ask you for ID?\n\nYes.  And in some cases, they can ask you to stand on your head.  If the police are *asking*, then you are free to comply or refuse, as you see fit.  California no longer has a law requiring you to carry identification at all times (and hasn't for close to twenty years) so it would surprise me to find another state that does.\n\nI can just about guarantee you a better answer if you provide the state you're in and the circumstances that bring about this question."

Should gay people be allowed to teach sex education? . Not an anti gay question.  Just thinking.  After years of knowing and having gay and lesbian friends,I have observed that once they are out of the closet they tend to blab about straight people being freaks, disgusting, or that somehow, straight sex is tasteless, totally un chic. Do you want your children to learn that in school? . Any decent teacher wouldn't be blabbing about the sexual habits of people to students.  Sex Education isn't about teaching kids how to have sex or who to have sex with.  So if it's a gay, professional teacher I wouldn't have a problem with it.  However if it's the type of gay person who talks to students about the things you mentioned, I would hope this person would be fired, regardless of what classes he/she teaches.  I would want a straight teacher fired for the same reasons.  Most of all I would hope that most parents are doing the responsible thing and making sure their kids are getting the right information about sex at home.	Education & Reference
Does anyone know how to open up McDonalds in Mongolia? . There is no McDonalds in Mongolia, but i am sure the business would be very good there.Market is  growing extremely. What should i do to open up McDonalds here?. Who should i contact? Does anyone wanna cooperate with me or know who might be interested? What requirements are there? . Total Investment: $506,000-$1,600,000\nInitial Franchise Fee: $45,000\nRoyalty Fee: 12.5%+\n\nYou have to buy a McDonald's franchise. In order to qualify for a conventional franchise you have to have $175,000 (not borrowed). Your total costs to open the restaurant, however, will be anywhere from $430,000 to $750,000 which goes to paying for the building, equipment, etc. Forty percent of this cost has to be from your own (non-borrowed) funds.  You'll pay an initial franchise fee of $45,000 directly to McDonald's. The other costs go to suppliers, so this is the only upfront fee you pay to McDonald's. Then, you'll go through a rigorous nine-month training period where you'll learn about the McDonald's way of doing things -- things like their standards for quality, service, value, formulas and specifications for menu items, their method of operation, and inventory control techniques. You'll have to agree to operate the restaurant from a single location, usually for 20 years, following their guidelines for decor, signage, layout and everything else that makes McDonald's McDonald's.\n\nOnce you've completed training and are ready to go, McDonalds will offer you a location they've already developed. The exterior of the building will be complete, but you will have to take care of interior additions such as kitchen equipment, seating and landscaping. You'll get constant support from a McDonald's Field Consultant, who can advise you on details and will visit regularly. You'll pay McDonald's a monthly fee of 4 percent of your sales, and either a flat base rent or a percentage rent of at least 8.5 percent of your sales. How much money you make depends on many things, including the location and its popularity, the efficiency of your operating costs, and your ability to manage and control the business.

what is the primary function of sperm? . a)activate the ova\nb)bring haploid set of chromosome . The reproductive anatomy of the male human is largely external. The male gonads, called testes, hang in a sac of skin called the scrotum. The testes produce sperm, which, in humans, cannot survive long at body temperature. The penis is the erectile organ responsible for the transfer of sperm to the vagina of the female. Just before ejaculation, mature sperm travel from the epididymis, a coiled tube behind each testis, through a long duct called the vas deferens. Sperm leave the body in semen, a fluid produced by the seminal vesicles. The secretions of the prostate and Cowperâs glands provide additional nutrients for the sperm.\n\n\nAND THE OTHER INFORMATION ABOUT IT ARE AS BELOW.\n\n\nIn male vertebrates, the ducts are directly connected to the testes and include the epididymis, which lies attached to the testis and which transports sperm to the vas deferens. This carries the spermatozoa to the ejaculatory duct, which contracts to discharge sperm into the posterior urethra.\n\nIn most fishes, the ovary has a hollow expansion through which the ova pass into the cloaca. In most other vertebrates, however, no direct connection exists between the ovary and the oviducts that carry the ova into the cloaca or into the independent external opening. In mammals, when the Graafian follicle bursts, the egg falls towards the interior of the abdominal cavity. The oviduct (known in higher mammals as the Fallopian tube) has an open, funnel-shaped end located near the ovary, into which the mature egg is drawn by ciliary action. Occasionally, the egg misses the open end of the oviduct and falls into the abdominal cavity; such eggs are capable of being fertilized, resulting in ectopic pregnancies. In animals lower than marsupials the oviducts open directly into the cloaca; in marsupials and placental mammals, the oviducts, two of which are normally present, fuse at their cloacal ends to form a thick, muscular organ, the uterus or womb, in which the young develop, and a thinner channel, the vagina, which open to the exterior.\n\nFOR MORE INFORMATION YOU CAN CONTACT ME ON ad786_alcatel@yahoo.com or 0093799990020.\n\nThanks and Regards\n\nAssad.

"Calculus: HELP!!!? . An integer ' n '  in base 8 is 3175 to ""the base of 8""(small 8 below the 5 couldnt find the symbol to put in). What is the integer immediately following ""n"" written in base 830. Could you please explain the work and steps used . I am lost.     thanks SOOO much . The 'good news' is that this problem does not involve calculus, only number theory (or counting).  The 'bad news' is that very few students 'get it' when it comes to bases other than 10 (after all, we use base 10 numbers daily, so we tend not to think about how they work!).\n\nI think the best way to deal with this subject is to take a minute to think about ""regular numbers"" like 276.  Say it out loud, ""Two hundred seventy six.""  If you literally started with THREE numbers -- a 200, a 70, and a 6 -- and added them together, you would end up with 276.  Right?\n\nWell, picking a number apart by its digits (like the '2', the '7' and the '6' above) is exactly what you do in any base.  Except, instead of 'hundreds', 'tens' and 'ones', you have to find ""powers of the new base"".\n\nPowers of 10, of course, are easy.  We call them names like 'thousand' (10^3) or 'million' (10^6).  But what are the powers of, say, 8?\n\nLet's list them:\n8 raised to the 0 power?  That's 1.  Any base to the zero power is 1.  So that's nice.\n\n8 raised to the 1 power?  That's 8.  Any base raised to the one power is 'itself.'\n\n8 raised to the 2 power?  That's 64.  Any base raised to the two power is 'itself times itself.'\n\n8 raised to the 3 power?  That's 512.  As you might have guessed, that's just 8*8*8.\n\nAnd so on... we only needed those powers for your problem.  Because the given number (3175) only has four digits!\n\nLet's take each digit, starting with the 3 and working our way toward the right.  We'll multiply each digit times the power of 8 (the given base) that the digit 'stands for'.  At the end, we'll add everything up!\n\n3 times 8^3 = 3 * 512 = 1536\n1 times 8^2 = 1 * 64   = 64\n7 times 8^1 = 7 * 8     = 56\n5 times 8^0 = 5 * 1     = 5\n\nAdd them all up, now.  = 1661 (in base 10)\n\nWe've just 'converted' to base 10 this way.  Does it seem strange that the 'same' number can be written different ways using different bases?  3175 (base 8) = 1661 (base 10)\n\nThis number could be represented a zillion different ways if you keep changing the base!\n\nBut the problem asks for you to convert it to base 830.  In fact, it's unclear whether we should now convert ""1661"" (the n we found) or ""1662"" (""the integer immediately after n"").\n\nLet's convert 1662 for fun, into base 830.\n\nLucky for us, the powers of 830 get BIG quickly, and we don't need more than the first couple of powers:\n\n830 ^ 0 =    1 (as always)\n830 ^ 1 = 830\n830 ^ 2 = ___ (way too BIG)\n\nAll we need to do is ask ""How many times will these powers of our new base go into 1662?""  And then repeat that question with the remainder.\n\n1662 divided by 830 is ""a little over 2"".  (Because 830 * 2 is only 1660.)  So, the first digit of the answer is '2'.  \n\nWhat is the remainder?  Subtract:  1662 - 1660 = 2.  The remainder happens to be two.\n\nHow many times will the next-lower power of 830 go into the remainder?  Lucky for us, the next-lower power of 830 is ""the 0 power"", so we're thinking about 1.  How many times does 1 go into two?  Exactly twice!\n\nSo the final digit of our answer is ALSO 2.\n\nThe answer is (put the digits together): 22!\n\nNeat, huh?"	Education & Reference

Will producing additional 150000 units products increase fixed manufacturing overhead cost? . why it will change the fixed overhead cost and why it dose not?.. . It will depend upon the facilities you currently have, and their output.  If your facility produced 10 million units 150,000 would only be a small amount and may not cause much increase in your costs.  If your manufacturing equipment runs on oil or some kind of support requirements that are increased by the number of units this could increase with 150,000 additional units.  Now if you are currently producing 10,000 units and your facilities have a capacity of 50,000 you will need to purchase new manufacturing equipment to support the additional demand, but if your costs for your equipment are independent of the number of units you produce and the quantity you wish to produce can be supported by your current equipment your fixed costs would not increase, and your fixed costs per unit would decrease. \n\nVariable costs which are not included in your fixed manufacturing overhead cost will also more than likely increase based on your production since you will need more staff to box or ship your new items.

why dont have a menstral period? . i am 29 yr old and have had about 6 periods my whole life starting at age 16. what could possibly be causing this? . There can be a lot of reasons for this.  One of the big ones is being extreme exercise.  Other reasons are usually hormone related and there are many differnt causes.  Definately check with an OB-Gyn about it.\n\nI only had 2-3 periods a year from the time I was 14 until I had a hysterectomy when I was 45.  When I was 29 and got pregnant the first time, I had a miscarriage.  I then had 5 more miscarriages over the next few years.  I saw a fertility specialist, and found out I had what was called a luteal phase defect and my uterus did not build up enough early in pregnancy to support a baby.  There are medications to treat many hormone problems, so the best place to start is your ob-gyn.	Health
Chemistry? . Determine First order, second order reactions for kinetics . For a first-order reaction, the rate of reaction is directly proportional to the concentration of one of the reactants.\n\nDifferential Rate Law:       r = k [A]\n\nThe rate constant, k, has units of sec-1. \nSecond-Order Reaction \n\nFor a second-order reaction, the rate of reaction is directly proportional to the square of the concentration of one of the reactants.\n\nDifferential Rate Law:       r = k [A]2\n\nThe rate constant, k, has units of L mole-1 sec-1. \n\n\nFor a first-order reaction, the rate of reaction is directly proportional to the concentration. As the reactant is consumed during the reaction, the concentration drops and so does the rate of reaction. \nFor a second-order reaction, the rate of reaction increases with the square of the concentration, producing an upward curving line in the rate-concentration plot. For this type of reaction, the rate of reaction decreases rapidly (faster than linearly) as the concentration of the reactant decreases.	Science & Mathematics

The Housing Authority in Virginia Beach will have the most comprehensive list of landlord's who offer low income apartments, duplexes and single family homes.

Is my relationship really based around true love? .  . True Love ....\n\nIt's as mysterious as the stars it was written on, as elusive. It is everything it's hyped about to be. It's worth taking every risk, it's worth fighting for, and the problem is if you don't risk all then you risk even more. Love is kind of an elixir that lures us out of reality and into the realm of fantasy. It's like a drug creating an altered state of consciousness.\n\nLove is the moment when an unfavorable act becomes favorable, when you make excuses for some one else's mistakes, when you learn to tolerate, when you learn acceptance, when sacrificing becomes the beauty of life. \n\nIt's the courage to tell the truth especially when you believe its unspeakable.\n\nIt's the time when seeing some one, being seen by some one and thinking about some one feels good, when you learn to find happiness in the smallest of moments.\n\nThat's love--when you learn to put down your ego and love some one more than that.\n\nLove is forgetting your self and remembering some one else. \n\nLove is choosing your partner exactly as he is, and supporting him in his choices. It's honoring your partner's truth and wanting best for him.\n\nIt's not controlling or possessing but rather respecting and trusting.\n\nIt does not mean owning some one, getting some one, rather it means being happy in your loved one's happiness.\n\nLove means living without judgments. It means treasuring your beloved and never taking him for granted. \n\nLove means being able to forgive and learning to give more then you get. It means reaching out when you don't want to, communicating rather than assuming and asking questions rather than jumping to conclusions.\n\nIt means working things out rather than fighting, fighting rather than leaving, and staying through the hurts and disappointments, knowing that through commitment all can be healed. \n\nFalling in love is like being enveloped in a magical cloud. The air feels fresher, the flowers smell sweeter, food tastes more delectable, and the stars shine more brightly at night. You feel light and lofty as though you are floating through life, and your problems and challenges suddenly seem insignificant and easily surmountable. Your body feels alive, your skin tingles and you awaken in the morning with a smile on your face. You are suspended in a state of supreme delight.\n\nLove is a feeling and an action that arises from the most primal place within us. Making a relationship however, is a process that is learned. A relationship is the vessel that carries the precious cargo of love through time.\n\nRelationships are like a precious antique lamp; it takes a little polish and some effort to restore it to its valuable condition. A relationships love and luster will only improve with age if you continually give it the care that keeps it beautiful. But once you uncover its essential beauty it will bring you joy for years to come.\n\nAfter having said all this I want to say that you have to make the decision on your own, on one hand love is magic, on the other it's time tested relationship worked hard and furiously at.

Herpes symptoms??? Rashes - 'gritty' skin bumps? - Itching??? . My oldest son knows that he has herpes -\nHe came to me asking if his 4th outbreak (ongoing for 2 months, now) can this time, include the symptoms that I've listed? \n\nAs I have no personal experience with this STD; the best I can advise him is to see an MD. . .\n\nAny suggestions, or personal input, from those of you who 'deal' with this virus? . Symptoms of herpes are called outbreaks. The first outbreak appears within 2 weeks after you become infected and can last for several weeks. These symptoms might include tingling or sores near the area where the virus has entered the body, such as on the genital or rectal area, on buttocks or thighs, or occasionally on other parts of the body where the virus has entered through broken skin. They also can occur inside the vagina and on the cervix in women, or in the urinary passage of women and men. Small red bumps appear first, develop into small blisters, and then become itchy, painful sores that might develop a crust and will heal without leaving a scar. \n\nSometimes, there is a crack or raw area or some redness without pain, itching, or tingling. \n\nOther symptoms that may accompany the first (and less often future) outbreak of genital herpes are fever, headache, muscle aches, painful or difficult urination, vaginal discharge, and swollen glands in the groin area. \n\nOften, though, people donât recognize their first or subsequent outbreaks. People who have mild or no symptoms at all may not think they are infected with herpes. They can still transmit the virus to others, however.	Health

We lost the war on 30th April 1975. Now to Iraq. Many of you ill informed tell me ""We are killing more of the enemy than they are killing of us"". Sorry to tell you this but that doesn't mean we will win. In fact as most of you people now know the Iraqi war is not going very well. In fact we are losing and are not going to win. ( Told to me by the Military troops at Selfridge ANG Base in Michigan ) Note:...Four troops just killed in Iraq . This goes on day after day. Do you agree? This war must be stopped. . Well Vietnam was stopped by adequate media coverage of it's failures. Perhaps it needs to be made more clear in the public eye that the events taking place, caused by our countries, is not serving to suit the needs of all people involved. I do not believe that the majority of people that do not live in the countries that this war is taking place are fully aware of the severity of the situation. They need to be made aware. Once they understand the extent of damage that is being caused, which is totally unjustified, they will be motivated into seeing that something is done about it.\nAnd if the Americans are fighting for freedom, what do you think the Iraqis, sorry, 'insurgents' are fighting for? The right to be opressed? I don't think so. They are fighting for control of their own country which does not belong to America.\nAnd if it's true that the reason America came in to Iraq was to free the people from Saddam, why are they not free now? Why was Saddam allowed to torture his people for 25 years, actively being supported by the American government a decade or two ago.\nAnd if America is so tough on dictators why did they put Pinochet in place?\nCan anyone answer that?\nI prey the more soldiers see the light and the web of lies they are trapped in."

what country bartolome de las casas explored for? what was his goal? what was his explorations? .  . BartolomÃ© de Las Casas, O.P. (1474 â July 17, 1566) was a 16th century Spanish priest, and the first resident Bishop of Chiapas. As a settler in the New World, he was galvanized by witnessing the brutal torture and genocide of the Native Americans by the Spanish colonists. He became famous for his advocacy of the rights of Native Americans, whose cultures especially in the Caribbean he describes with care. His first hand interpretations of TaÃ­no cultures as feudal have been criticized 500 years later by Marx-influenced historians since it does not fit into their theoretical vision of the progress of society. However his descriptions of Caciques (chiefs or princes), Bohiques (shamans or clerics), Ni-TaÃ­nos (noblemen), and Naborias (common folk), clearly show a feudal structure. His book A Short Account of the Destruction of the Indies (ISBN 0140445625) (BrevÃ­sima relaciÃ³n de la destrucciÃ³n de las Indias), published in 1552, gives a vivid description of the atrocities committed by the conquistadors in the Americas â most particularly, the Caribbean, Central America, and what is now modern Mexico â including many events to which he was a witness. In one of his last works before his death, De thesauris in Peru, he vigorously defended the rights of the natives of Peru against the native slavery imposed by the early Spanish Conquest. The work also questions the right of property Spain had in taking the treasures derived from the ransom to free Atahualpa (the Inca leader), as well as those valuables found and taken from the burial sites of the indigenous population.

"What are the characteristics that define a rainforest? .  . Characteristics\nRainforests are characterized by high rainfall, with definitions setting minimum normal annual rainfall between 2,000 mm (about 78 inches or 2 meters) and 1700 mm (about 67 inches). The soil can be poor because high rainfall tends to leach out soluble nutrients.\n\nRain forests are home to two-thirds of all the living animal and plant species on the planet. It has been estimated that many hundreds of millions of new species of plants, insects, and microorganisms are still undiscovered and as yet unnamed by science. Tropical rain forests are called the ""jewel of the earth"", the ""Earth's lungs"", and the ""world's largest pharmacy"" because of the large amount of natural medicines discovered there.\n\nDespite the growth of flora in a rainforest, the actual quality of the soil is quite poor. Oxisols, infertile, and deeply weathered, have developed on the ancient Gondwanan shields. Rapid bacterial decay prevents the accumulation of humus. The concentration of iron and aluminium oxides by the laterization process gives the oxisols a bright red color and sometimes produces minable deposits (e.g. bauxite). On younger substrates, especially of volcanic origin, tropical soils may be quite fertile.\n\nhttp://www.answers.com/RAINFOREST"	Science & Mathematics

What things have happened in your lives such as eating habits and changes in lifestyle that might have encouraged this weight gain? \nFor one don't divorce her. Two, hopefully you married her on a higher level beyond her looks even though that also was an attraction you had towards her. Also for her to ask you she is already aware of the fact that she has gained this weight and would probably would like to hear such things like, ""We can do it together, take it one step at a time,etc..."" Do things with her like eating healthy, and exercising, so she knows she has your support in it. Also, try different sexual positions, be more exotic and make love to her because she wants it not just because you want it. Sex can also be a very exciting and fun way to lose weight.

how do you add pounds or draw weight to a bow? .  . As was stated before, just tighten up the limb bolts on a compound and you'll be increasing the tension on the limbs which will increase draw weight.  Use care to do this equally, and incrementally or you will throw off the timing of the wheels or cams for each limb.\n\nAnother option which could be applied to a longbow, a recurve, or a compound bow is to install a new bowstring that is shorter than the one presently in use.  You don't want to go too short, as there is a limit to how much you will be able to gain doing this before you start to have other problems.  Since a bowstring will stretch over time, sometimes buying a new one of the same length will add a couple of pounds just by itself.  You can also twist the bowstring to make it a bit shorter too, but that works better with compounds than with recurves or longbows since you do it only once on a compound bow.\n\nRemember that draw weight is relative to draw length on a non-compound bow.  Increase draw length and you increase draw weight.	Sports

How could my education have been saved?? Could I have used home eduacation? if so then how? . I need advice/an opinion. When I first started high school I lost two people of whom I was very close to. I became very depressed. I started to refuse to go to school on-and-off regularly. It was the biggest mistake of my life. this carried on for two years. No-one helped me. my parents then sent me to a private schoo, and lied to the head tecaher saying that I wasn't behind in my schholwork..when I was..seriously behind.... I found I couldn't keep up with the work..by the end of the year I couldn't cope anymore and because I didn't know what to do...refused to go to school altogether.(this was the end of my third year in high school) I was then at home with 3 measly hours of home tuition in only Englah and art....for the next 2 years. I got G grades in my GCSEs (apart from English) what I need to know is.....when I was at the end of my 3rd year and then went to ahve home tuition...how could I have fixed the situation then/ what could I have done? I didn't have a clue how I could have caught up/what I should have done to fix the situation at this point.  WHAT SHOULD I HAVE DONE BACK THEN? HOW COULD I HAVE FIXED THINGS? PLEASE HELP AS THIS IS IMPORTANT TO ME. Could I somehow have caught up if my parents had been able to arrange proper home education/tuition for me?(starting again with year7/first high school year work) and then taking 5 years to catch up before I sat my GCSEs?(so I would have been taking my GCSEs about now) or would this not have worked? If not...then why?\nalso...how could this home education have been arranged/organised?? Since my parents wouldn't have had a clue how to structure this?\nCan anyone provide me with any answers? please don't say that it doesn't matter anymore...because it really does to me...and it would help me to sort my head out if I knew the answers to these things. \nI live in England\nHow could this home education have been organised/structured?? .

"what is the function of the cloaca? . hello again whats up anyways i need to also know this by tomorrow lol i know im funny anyways because you guys proboly wont even get this anyways thanks againf for your help i greatly apriciate it. ps  i dont know if you guys email back or what ever but even if it is after monday i would still like my answers with lots of love alicea . In zoological anatomy, a cloaca is the posterior opening that serves as the only such opening for the intestinal, urinary, and genital tracts of certain animal species. The word comes from Latin, and means ""sewer"". All birds, reptiles, and amphibians possess this orifice, by which they simultaneously evacuate both urine and feces. Monotremes also possess one. In contrast, each individual among most species of placental mammals and bony fishes has, in lieu of a cloaca, a specialized opening for at least one of these tracts.\n\nExcretory systems with analogous purpose in certain invertebrates are also sometimes referred to as ""cloaca"".\n\nIn birds the reproductive system must be regrown prior to the mating season of each species. Such regeneration usually takes about a month. Birds generally produce one batch of eggs per year, but they will produce another batch if the first is taken away (they have the ability to produce more).\n\nThe cloacal region is also often associated with a secretory organ, the cloacal gland, which has been implicated in the scent marking behaviour of some reptiles, amphibians and monotremes.\n\nSome turtles, especially those specialized in diving, are highly reliant on cloacal respiration during dives. [1] They accomplish this by having a pair of accessory air bladders connected to the cloaca which can absorb oxygen from the water. [2][3]"	Science & Mathematics
"who,when & where does AIDS virus took birth.? .  . This is a pet topic of mine...\n\nThe origin of AIDS and HIV has puzzled scientists ever since the illness first came to light in the early 1980s. For over twenty years it has been the subject of fierce debate and the cause of countless arguments, with everything from a promiscuous flight attendant to a suspect vaccine program being blamed. So what it the truth? Just where did AIDS come from?\n\nThe first 'officially recognized' cases of ""AIDS"" occurred in the USA in the early 1980s (the real origin was later recognized to be Africa and a lot earlier than 1980). A number of gay men in New York and San Francisco suddenly began to develop rare opportunistic infections and cancers that seemed stubbornly resistant to any treatment. At this time, AIDS did not yet have a name, but it quickly became obvious that all the men were suffering from a common syndrome. The discovery of HIV, the Human Immunodeficiency Virus that causes AIDS was made soon after. While some were initially resistant to the connection (and indeed remain so today), there is now clear evidence to prove that HIV does cause AIDS. So, in order to find the source of AIDS, it is necessary to look for the origin of HIV, and find out How, When and Where HIV first began to cause disease in humans.\n\nOne theory of the origin of AIDS is that it developed in the Belgian Congo from contaminated vaccines used in the world's first mass immunization for polio. There are a number of reasons why this theory is plausible enough to be worthy of further investigation.\n\n1. The location coincides dramatically. The earliest known cases of AIDS occurred in central Africa, in the same regions where Koprowski's polio vaccine was given to over a million people in 1957-1960.\n\n2. The timing coincides. There is no documented case of HIV infection or AIDS before 1959. Centuries of the slave trade and European exploitation of Africa exposed Africans and others to all other diseases then known; it is implausible that HIV could have been present and spreading in Africa without being recognized.\n\n3. Polio vaccines are grown (cultured) on monkey kidneys which could have been contaminated by SIVs. Polio vaccines could not be screened for SIV contamination before 1985.\n\n4. Another monkey virus, SV-40, is known to have been passed to humans through polio vaccines. A specific pool of Koprowski's vaccine was later shown to have been contaminated by an unknown virus.\n\n5. In order for a virus to infect a different species, it is helpful to reduce the resistance of the new host's immune system. Koprowski's polio vaccine was given to many children less than one month old, before their immune systems were fully developed. Indeed, in one trial, infants were given 15 times the standard dose in order to ensure effective immunization.\n\nIf this theory is correct, it has serious ethical, health and policy implications. In particular, it points to the danger of interspecies transfer of material through vaccinations, organ transplants, etc., which could lead to new variants of AIDS as well as other new diseases. As well, studying the theory may lead to insights about responding to AIDS and preventing new diseases.\n\nHowever, there has been no sustained attempt to test the theory. This could be done, for example, by testing stocks of polio vaccine for the presence of SIV. An offer to undertake tests was made as early as 1991; only in 2000 were some samples tested, and then only US-made vaccine. Another possibility would be to test stored blood samples in Africa from before 1950. If HIV is found, this would undermine the theory.\n\nAlthough the theory has not been properly examined, many people seem to believe it has been refuted. Hilary Koprowski published a letter in Science in 1992 attacking the theory. In 1993, Rolling Stone, which had published a widely publicized article by Tom Curtis about the theory, published an ""update"", interpreted by Science as a"	Education & Reference

It borders Armenia, Azerbaijan (including its Nakhichevan exclave), and Turkmenistan to the north, Pakistan and Afghanistan to the east, and Turkey and Iraq to the west. In addition, it shares the Persian Gulf waters with Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, Qatar, and the United Arab Emirates.\n\nFrom 600 BC until 1935, the country was referred to in the West as Persia. On March 21, 1935, Reza Shah Pahlavi issued a decree asking foreign delegates to use the native term Iran in formal correspondence. [2] A dispute exists about the country's current official name. After Persian scholars' protested, Mohammad Reza Shah in 1959 announced both ""Persia"" and ""Iran"" could be used interchangeably. In 1979, the Iranian Revolution eventually led by the Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini established a theocratic Islamic Republic. Iran retained its name and its political title was changed to the Islamic Republic of Iran."	Business & Finance

I KNOW that you wouldn't protest against immigrants and have the stupidity to call all Mexicans stupid and lazy, would you? . That is right, 100% correct. Many people say things but it is easier to say them than to do them. They can say many things but it is because that is not them in that position. I'm glad that there are people like you who understand  this.Yes you can be loyal to two countries. It is soooo sad that people say that they could do be only loyal to America and forget their native country if they were in this position, saying that is just a plain big lie. It makes me so angry seeing people saying , ""yes I could do that"" when in REALITY then know that they do not, could not, would not, do that, even if they say they can.\n It is just like speaking two languages, you can never forget your mother  because well, it is your mother language! You can happy, interested, grateful and proud of speaking the other language, and maybe you would even speak it more than your mother language but yet you can not forget the language in which you grew with. It is the same, You can be loyal to two countries, just like you can speak two languages, and many people could say that I'm comparing apples with oranges but I do not care because what  I have said is true.

How much do you get paid from being a teacher? .  . When I started teaching in Louisiana, with a MA and 2 years experience around 1994, I made about $13,000.  I moved to California and teach in Los Angeles, where I make about $60,000.  I finally feel adequately compensated.  I'm able to travel and buy what I want, when I want.  I'm married and my husband is a professor, and his salary is only slightly higher than mine.  In a few more years, I will surpass him in earnings.\n\nSome states are much better paid than others.  If you want to be a teacher, look around you.  Go to where the money is, or get into another field.  Teaching is worthwhile emotionally, but it also really helps to be paid like a professional.  When I was in Louisiana, I didn't feel like a professional.  Now that I'm in California, I feel like I am being paid much better, and my work reflects this.  In Louisiana I felt demoralized.  Here I feel supported.\n\nHope this helps.  Cheers, K, teacher for 14 years\n\nP. S.  What Quatrapiller said is a bunch of crap, by the way.  I and all other teachers don't ALLOW others to get away with not appreciating us.  In fact we kick, scream, fight and yell and DEMAND our just appreciation, because we know we deserve it.  This is one of those old stereotypes that needs to DIE.  I cannot stand self-perpetuating stereotypes.  It's just so WRONG.  \n\nI know I and other teachers aren't at all afraid to step up and demand appreciation and acknowledgement for what we do.  That's part of professionalism: no martyr complex... take pride in what you do... never allow your profession to be put down... build up your profession and your colleagues... demand your just dues.

"I'm want to be a game designer, but I'm only 15. What should I do? .  . A few things to consider:\n\nOne, what part of game development interests you? Broadly speaking, there are three roles involved in the development of games:\n\nProgrammers - game developers, testers, and tools programmers. These are the people who do the actual work of building the game, and create the program that makes everything happen.\n\nArtists - 3d modelers and 2d artists and texturers. These are the people who create the ""look"" of the game - every object that appears on-screen has to be modeled, and the surfaces of the objects need to ""painted"" to resemble whatever they're supposed to be.\n\nDesigners - level designers, interaction designers and ""game designers."" These are the people who figure out how things work, and create the ""feel"" of what it's like to play the game. There ususally aren't many on a development team, and they often end up doing other organizational work, too.\n\nWhat to study depends on which of these sounds appealing. If you like the idea of game programming, then study how to program and practice writing code for fun. If art appeals, get a 3d modeler or 2d painting software and learn to create things with it. If you want to design, make sure you understand at least a little bit about programming and art, and practice your writing and speaking - designers need to be able to communicate.\n\nFor all of these roles, learn to play videogames with a critical eye - when a game isn't fun, ask yourself why it isn't fun. When a game is, ask what succeeds about it. What could make it better? A good way to learn about what makes games fun is to play and create board and card games - learning games as a whole, and being able to talk about them intelligently will be a big help.\n\nAnd, if you decide that gaming isn't for you later, then an education based around the fundamentals of design like that will leave you able to do quite a bit besides gaming.\n\nGood luck!"

Do you mean you were having sex and a farting sound came out of your vagina? Hun, that's normal.  A guy pumping his penis in your vagina repeatedly is going to trap air in there, if you suddenly change position or your muscles clench or he suddenly thrusts is deeply then the air is going to be randomly pushed out causing the sound of fastly escaping air which sounds like a fart.  Just recognise that a 'vart' is normal and that it's going to happen everyso often, just laugh a bit and carry on.  If your guy has any sense or maturity about him then he knows what's going on and will just be waiting for you to stop laughing so he can get back to what you two were doing before hand.  Guy's don't care, why should they?  It's not like you dutch ovened him.  Forget about it, relax any clenched muscles and get back to the good lovin' :D enjoy	Family & Relationships

"What is a blog? .  . A blog is an online journal of your virtual life. \n\nA blog is much simpler: \n\nA blog is normally a single page of entries. There may be archives of older entries, but the ""main page"" of a blog is all anyone really cares about. \n\nA blog is organized in reverse-chronological order, from most recent entry to least recent. \n\nA blog is normally public -- the whole world can see it. \n\nThe entries in a blog usually come from a single author. \n\nThe entries in a blog are usually stream-of-consciousness. There is no particular order to them. For example, if I see a good link, I can throw it in my blog. The tools that most bloggers use make it incredibly easy to add entries to a blog any time they feel like it. \n\n\nBasically, a blog is a lot like an online journal or diary. The author can talk about anything and everything. Many blogs are full of interesting links that the author has found. Blogs often contain stories or little snippets of information that are interesting to the author. \n\nCreating your own blog is now easy because there are Web-based toolsets that make the management of your blog incredibly simple -- Blogger, Xanga, TypePad, and LiveJournal are just a few of the services available. You can create basic blogs for free, and most of these toolsets have additional features available for a price. \n\nCreating a simple blog is free and only takes about five minutes. You enter your name, e-mail address and a few other pieces of information. You select ""the look"" (template) for your blog from a set of standard templates. Click a few buttons and you're done. \n\nNow you can add new entries to your blog. Basically, all you do is type in the entry and push the ""post"" button to post it. You can edit the entry as much as you like by clicking the ""edit"" button. When you are happy with the new entry, you push the ""publish"" button to make your new entry visible on your public blog. \n\nOne of the best Web sites I have found recently is called ExploreMarsNow.com. I added a short entry about it to my blog in about 10 seconds. The entry says simply: \n\nI really like this Web site: ExploreMarsNow. \nThat's it. A blog entry can be that simple. Or it can be an entire story. It's all up to you."	Computers & Internet

Question for diabetics. What do you think of this situation? . I have recently had problems with my blood pressure going up then sometimes in the normal range. I also have had fluid retention. My feet, legs, and ankles swell also. I was given HCTZ to take for the fluid and even after I complained that my feet, legs and ankles had a burning sensation, my doctor said nothing. I went off the HCTZ on my own and the burning sensation went away. I knew it was from the med but he didn't. I have also vision changes. I told my doctor that I had some symptoms that diabetics have. I asked him if a blood test would show if I had diabetes. He said it does and then said my blood tests are fine. Then I got a letter from him telling me my glucose has improved. I was never told that my glucose was not normal. What does this letter mean? He has not asked me to make another appointment nor has he scheduled other tests for me. Has anyone with diabetes ever been diagnosed with a medical conditon other than diabestes, when the real diagnosis should have been diabetes? . First, you should change a doctor.  A good doctor should never let his patient confused like this. \n\nDiabetes is defined as fasting blood glucose higher than 126, twice.  So the easiest way to find out is to get a copy of your blood test result, and look at it yourself.  \n\nSince you've stopped HCTZ, make sure you are taking something else for your blood pressure.

How do I pursuade a Bi-Polar-Manic Depressive person to get help? . This person is basically a great one, but from time to time explodes with very little reason.  Depression is a big part of life, and is not easily overcome.  Alcohol has been a problem from time to time, but self pity overrules all.  I see a glimmer of hope occasionally, but when I suggest medical help, all blows.  Then come the accusations, and darkness, self pity etc. . Part of the problem with people with untreated bi-polar disorder is that the manic episodes are often so great feeling (lots of energy, creativity, etc.) that they don't WANT treatment. That's if they even recognize it as such. As not only the parent of a child with Bi polar Disorder, but also a patient with it, I understand that, yet I know that the crash that always follows is not worth it...to me.  \n\nWithout the person accepting their problem, regardless of what it is (mental health issue or otherwise), there's no way to get them to seek treatment. \n\nWhile it's good of you to be supportive, there comes a point where self-preservation for you must come first...at least until the person accepts the situations and takes action.  This is especially true if you suffer from depressive symptoms yourself.  I find when I'm around depressed people, my own depression worsens or kicks in. \n\nGood luck in coping with this. I'm sorry I couldn't be of more help.	Health

Does it take a PHD to perform autopsy? .  . Autopsies are generally performed by medical doctors (MDs).  You have to go to med school and then a residency in pathology to perform autopsies.  \n\nFrom the Univ of Maryland website: Autopsies ordered by the state can be performed by a county coroner, who is not necessarily a physician. A medical examiner who performs an autopsy is usually a pathologist.\n\nThis information may be specific to Maryland and not applicable to the other 49 states.\n\n\nPh.D.s can do medical research, but they do not practice medicine, so they cannot perform autopsies (maybe if they are county coroner in Maryland?).  However, Ph.D.s can analyze data from autopsies, including blood alcohol level and detection of any type of specific compounds.\n\nFinal Note: County coroners are elected officials, who don't necessarily have *any* medical training.  I'd rather have a real pathologist trying to figure out why I died!\n\n\nYou can also perform your own autopsy here:\nhttp://www.le.ac.uk/pa/teach/va/welcome.html	Science & Mathematics

I truly believe that you would not chose this lifestyle if you had a choice.  \n\nGood luck to you.	Family & Relationships

chaos theory..what do you know about it? . and can u explain for me the butterfly effect? . In a nutshell.. the butterfly effect proposes that the flap of a butterfly's wing in one part of the world say for examle the unitedstates, could cause a tornado to occur in another part of the world for example Europe. So one extremely small event could cause something majorly catastrophic to happen. I believe this was first discovered with sizemographs and earthquake patterns. It's not a fact, just theory, but there is a lot to support it. So chaos theory basically says that any organized system is prone to collapse or fall apart because chaos will eventually be introduced into it. Like in the movie Jurassic park there was a scientist played by Jeff Goldblume who was constantly trying to convince the owner of the island that eventually all the dinosaurs would escape or something bad would happen because of chaos. He was all into chaos theory.. and lo and behold he was right. Ofcourse that's just a movie, but chaos theory applies much to real life.	Science & Mathematics

My live in boyfriend is not very affectionate. What could be the problem? . I use to date this guy about 11 years ago. He was actually my first love and i was his. And now after all these years we're finally together. But he has changed so much in the afection part. Now he hardly ever kisses me, even when we make love. He tells me he loves me everyday, but it's usually just when he leaves to go somewhere. He use to always be affectionate in the public to but now he's not. He has just changed so much over the years and it is really a problem with me because I need alot of attention and affection or i feel like there is a problem or he just don't love me. I have talked to him about several things but all he always tells me is he loves me and ain't another woman that can take my place and he is the happiest he's ever been. He was locked up in prison for about 8 yrs, could this be part of the problem? We both have been married to other people and have kids by them. He is very good with my kids also. . I don't intend to me mean, but it sounds like the issue is yours and not his.  Okay - so he isn't as affectionate, but he sounds affectionate enough.\n\nHe isn't the same guy he was years ago.  Let's face it, the testosterone levels of a 20-yr. old would kill him today.  His body just couldn't take it.\n\nLook - talk to him about it - let him know your needs.  It sounds like he will do what he can to accommodate.  However, if he really loves you and takes good care of your kid, you have it better than 90% of the rest of us.  Be happy in that.\n\nGood luck.\nC	Family & Relationships
"who benefits from plea bargaining? . does it sacrific rights of defendants or does the guilty benefit? . The first stool pigeon in the gang benefits the most, disproportionately to guilt.\n\nThe State benefits because it gets certainty (or at least better chance) of conviction. It saves a lot of money on trials.\n\nLater defendants don't get offered much of a discount for plea bargaining.\n\nIn minor cases, ""mis-pleas"" are common: accepting a guilty plea to a misdemeanor, or not proceeding under the 3-strikes law, to get a guilty plea and not have to go through a very expensive trial and appeal.

Those who live in Canada:Please explain the full time job working hours to me.? . Please mention when the work begins and what time it ends.\nWhat about elementary schools,from what time do students go to school and when do they come back home.\nI want to find out if I work there ,can I take care of my 8year old daughter? . Full time employment in Canada usually means a total of 8 hours per day from the time you start until the time you finish, not including your lunch and coffee breaks.\n\nSchools will vary their starting and ending times.  School Districts are required to do this in order to provide bus transportation for the students who qualify.  For example, I've taught in schools that start at 8:30 a.m. and others that start at 9:00 a.m.  And, I've taught at schools where our day finished at 3:00 p.m. and others where we finished at 3:45 p.m.\n\nSome schools have on-site day care facilities with before and after-school programs.  Participation in these will depend on availability of space, however and you would be lowest on their list since you would be newest to apply. \n\nIn Ontario, there are also government subsidies for day care costs depending on your eligibility status.  You would need to check with the Day Care about that.  \n\nAnother consideration is what you do with your daughter on days when school is not in session (holidays and professional activity days) or when she might not be well enough to attend school and day care.  What do you do when the school phones to say that your daughter has become ill during the school day and needs to be taken home?\n\nYou not only need your initial plan but you also need back-ups.\n\nGood luck.

i've been walking on the beach for exercise.  fast walking.  is it okay to do this barefoot? . i'm just not sure if i should be wearing shoes. . So long as you watch where you step and are not experiencing pain, then you shouldn't worry about it.  Actually, walking barefoot on sand can help to strengthen the muscles in you feet and will often improve balance.  Just keep an eye out for sharp items such as glass or metal that may have been dropped or washed ashore.  Also, be on the lookout for wildlife, such as jellyfish that can wash ashore and are still capable of stinging.  Obviously, if you are experiencing pain related to the walking on sand, you may want to cut back or contact a podiatrist or your physician.	Sports

Some have played equally good sides, some have not. Germany does have the home turf advantage but that's only a small part of the psychology of the game. They have not had great wins yet but none the less they have been determined enough to continue to get the result. Argentina have been very good. They have their attack down well and their defence has withheld. This will be a really good game, I just think in the end the flair and natural ability of the Argentinians will give them the best result."	Sports

Your thoughts on this man being deported? . http://www.nytimes.com/2006/05/12/nyregion/12canadian.html\n\nWould this not prove perhaps that individual circumstances be considered before deporation? Or do you truly believe that illegal=immediate deportation no matter what? . Doesn't Immigration ALWAYS consider individual circumstances before deportation?  In this case it sounds like he had the right to be here and just didn't file an extension which would have been automatic.  In that case and because he was in the military, absolutely I would personally not want him deported.\n\nI note that he stayed in Germany to take advantage of their free health care for his son with a heart condition, and as soon as he got back to North America he ran up to Canada to make sure his kids' paperwork was in place, but didn't take care of his own paperwork.  I totally understand that for the health care of his child he would want to exercise the kids' rights to Canadian citizenship and health care.  However, I wonder if there was some 'taking advantage of Canadian citizenship rights' that was somehow antagonistic to being a permanent resident here.  I don't see it in the article, though, so I hope he is not deported.\n\nI frankly think that so long as an alien is not 'undesirable' there should be an automatic path to residence through the military.  If they are willing to defend this country, I think the least we can do is welcome them to live in it.  However, that is not the law at the moment.	Politics & Government

Specifically, complainants allege that after agreeing to purchase an initial ""ad package"", the company engages in high-pressure sales tactics with the promise of higher earnings. Complainants also state that once they have agreed to pay the substantially higher fees, the company does not respond to inquiries. The Bureau has also received complaints stating that the company refuses to refund monies, stating that there is no money back guarantee or refund policy.""\n\nBBB has also asked them to substantiate the claims they make on their website such as ""How much can you make from these AWSM AD's?

for people with hight BP, why does salt cause a sudden rise in BP & sometimes even unconsciousness/ death? . clinical/ chemistry explination . The pressure in their vessels is high already.  If you add excess salt to your diet your body tries to reach a hemostatic equilibrium by retaining water.  Eventually too much water is kept in the vessels, the pressure increases more and a vessel somewhere bursts.  The most damaging areas are in the brain (causes a stroke and increased intercranial pressure), lungs (causes pneumonia), and the heart (causes heart failure).	Science & Mathematics

"question for patent lawyer/attorney on career? . Hi, im a student in college right now extremely interested in becoming a patent lawyer but I have a ton of questions:\n\n1) What is it like to be a patent lawyer\n2) what does a typical day look like\n3) Im going to get a degree in biochemistry, does it matter what science I choose? Are my career options limited rather than majoring in engineering?\n4) What is the starting salary in new york?\n5) is law school required to become a patent attorney?\n6) When should I take the patent bar?\n7) How do I get an internship for a patent attorney?\n\nAlso, any additional websites would be helpful as well. \n\nand if you can, you dont have to, but anyone who is a patent attorney, could you leave your email so I can email you if I have any questions. (Optional)\n\nThanks so much! . 1.  It's great if you like science.  For one thing, you get to work in a lot of different scientific areas instead of getting pigeonholed into one area.  Second, you make a lot more money than you ever would as an engineer or scientist.  In those fields you often have to stop doing science and get into management in order to advance past a certain point.  As a patent attorney you can advance as far as you like and still get to do the interesting work.\n \n2.  There are so many different areas you can go into, it's hard to say.  You can do patent application preparation and prosecution, you can do transactional work, you can work in acquisitions and due diligence, you can work in licensing, infringement and validity analysis, litigation, writing appeals -- the list is endless.  Also your experience will be different depending on whether you choose to work for a corporation or in a law firm.\n\n3.  Biochemistry is a good field to be in if you intend to be a patent attorney, because patent attorneys with degrees in biochemistry are in demand.  Whether biochemical, chemical, or electrical/mechanical engineers are more in demand varies year-to-year, but don't let that worry you.  Take the course of study you love the most; that's the best way to ensure success whether you go on to be an intellectual property or patent attorney, or whether you stay in the scientific field itself.  Patent attorneys have usually majored in electrical or mechanical (especially electrical) engineering, chemistry, biology, or biochemistry.  I majored in physics.\n\n4.  I don't know what the starting salary is these days.  When I started in 1993 in Washington, DC I started at $70,000/year at a law firm, but I'm sure the starting salary is much higher than that now.\n\n5.  In the United States, yes, you need to be a lawyer in order to become a patent attorney, as well as have a bachelors degree in a scientific field.  So of course you have to go to law school.  You could be just a patent agent with only a scientific degree, without going to law school, but they usually get paid much less -- when they can get work. Also, any attorney can be a litigator, and litigate intellectual property (patent, copyright, trademark, etc.) cases even if they haven't had a technical degree!\n\n6.  Most people take the patent ""bar exam"" soon after starting work for a law firm or corporation.  I took it my final year in law school, which I believe helped me in my job search.\n \n7.  Most law students who want to go into intellectual property law get a summer internship at an intellectual property law firm after their second year in law school."	Politics & Government

"What's the best way to learn how to swim? . I'm an older teenager who is uneasy about going near water simply because I can't swim! . Okay. So, if there is a local, ""open"" swimming pool in your town area, go there. Then, start at the deep end (not too deep). Hold breath in the air and then go down in the water. And just breathe, down in the water, just breathe. Breath with your nose and mouth. Just imagine being a fish, you know, when we were babies in the stomach, we breathe in water! Just do it. Don't be scared. When you breathe underwater, you are fine, soon the water would push you up when you're running out of oxygen or just kick your feet up if you need more air. Then keep doing this. It'll help you *immensley*. Once you learn how to breathe, things will get a lot easier. And just Try to swim or float on the water while breathing. So you are basically teaching your body to swim. Okay, during the summer, take swimming lessons in your local town area. You'll learn breastroke, sidestrock, FRONTSTROKE, BACKSTROKE, elementary backstroke, butterfly. Etc. But most importanly, just teach yourself a little, just be a fish! Just thing as water as your home."	Sports

"Why do so many ""professional"" sites display in fixed 800px width, including this very page? They got no brain? .  . I'm going to guess you are a designer like me who encourages ""fluid"" or ""liquid"" displays that use all of the screen's real estate. I worked on a fluid site for a number of years and realized that sometimes my design might look a little different than I intended it at certain browser sizes. It is also sometimes difficult to get items to layout properly.\n\nHowever, to me the benefits of allowing the user to adjust the screen width outweighed my dislike for how the page might look at some sizes.\n\nMost of Yahoo! uses a fixed screen size. This is probably due to a graphic designer being in charge of the spec guidelines. They probably want everything to be pixel perfect and can't stand the thought of the possiblity of something being out of line.\n\nDesigners need to realize that many users have multiple browsers open at once. If the web sites aren't fluid, then browsing the two sites at once will require using the horizontal scroll bar that nobody likes to use.\n\nI like everything about this site except it rigid width design."

I want to know a bout nano drug & drug delivery system,esp. about anti cancer drug.Is there anyone could help? .  . Generally all nanotech drug delivery systems work by microencapsulating drugs/poisons in vesicles.  The previous reply is correct in saying that certain receptors can then activate the decomposition of said vesicle and the delivery of the drug.  However, also there is research currently being undertaken where it is not just the enemy virus/cell which is sought out, but also the chemicals produced by certain illnesses, for example cancer.  Therefore a nanofabricated drug 'capsule' can be made to release its contents when it is in an area of high concentration of a certain illnesses byproduct.  This has increased the range of diseases which can be attacked.  In particular HIV where the receptors on the outside of the cell undergo mutations depending on the strain and point of lifecycle.

What is the difference between Pride FC and UFC? . Other than the fact that 1 is in a ring and the other in a cage. . I am a fan of both the UFC and the Pride FC so i hope i am able to help.\nPride is in Japan and has a huge following so the money is much better over there and attracts the better fighters. The Pride rules can vary from fight to fight and allow strikes that the ufc wont such as stomping your opponent when they are on the ground. The Pride FC is legal and the Japanese are as crazy about Martial Arts as we are about Baseball.\nThe UFC is American and first aired live in 1993 when the legendary Royce Gracie defeated 3 men in one night to become the first UFC champion. The UFC was seen as barbarrak having no rules unlike Pride witch came about in 1997. The UFC was banned on TV after UFC 4 and relied on the Internet for viewing. Not having a huge following the prize money was not that great and the fighters were not world class athletes with a few exceptions that soon went over to Japan for the better money. The UFC has since become legal with rules that were more suitable for television and has become more and more popular. \n \nOther than one being in a cage and the other a ring there isn't much of a difference some fighters fight in both Pride and the UFC. At the moment Dana White (the president of the UFC) is trying to to make a deal with the Pride organisation to have UFC champ Chuck Liddel to take on Pride champ Wanderlei Silva to unify the two belts. Unfortunately he has been un successful so to answer your question there is no real difference other than some slight rule differences.	Sports

Any Advice, husband thinking of getting circumcised.? . My husband recently began thinking about getting circumcised. Oddly enough i've never been with a circumcised man and didn't really know how to respond when he told me he was thinking about having it done? Is it really any different at all? Has anyone been in a similar situation? Well any answers/advice would help really. . In my experience, sex with a circumcised man verses a non-circumcised man has not been very different.  \n For oral sex on an uncircumcised penis there is the extra skin to work with until the penis is fully extended.  For vaginal intercourse the feel is no different between the two in my opinion.\n   When a grown man gets circumcised it is a lot more painful and will take a while before he will be ready for intercourse again.  Until he is healed you can take advantage of alternative methods of play. \nIf this is what he really wants then I say go for it!  It could spice things up in the marriage to have the change.  You might consider doing something different for fun as well.  It doesn't have to be surgical.  How about a Brazilian wax?\nMy brother had this procedure done when he was older and said it felt like he had a potato in his pants for weeks.  He is very happy with the final result.

Concerning Praseodymium & Neodymium, where are these elements crucial? . Would life on Earth be able to survive without them? . Uses of praseodymium:\n\nAs an alloying agent with magnesium to create high-strength metals that are used in aircraft engines. \nPraseodymium forms the core of carbon arc lights which are used in the motion picture industry for studio lighting and projector lights. \nPraseodymium compounds are used to give glasses and enamels a yellow color. \nPraseodymium is a component of didymium glass, which is used to make certain types of welder's and glass blower's goggles. \nDr. Matthew Sellars of the Laser Physics Centre at the Australian National University in Canberra, Australia slowed down a light pulse to a few hundred meters per second using praseodymium mixed with silicate crystal. \n\nApplications\nUses of neodymium include\n\nNeodymium is a component of didymium used for colouring glass to make welder's goggles. \nNeodymium colours glass in delicate shades ranging from pure violet through wine-red and warm grey. Light transmitted through such glass shows unusually sharp absorption bands; the glass is used in astronomical work to produce sharp bands by which spectral lines may be calibrated. Neodymium is also used to remove the green colour caused by iron contaminants from glass. \nNeodymium salts are used as a colourant for enamels. \nNeodymium is used in the strongest permanent magnets known - Nd2Fe14B. These magnets are cheaper, lighter, and stronger than samarium-cobalt magnets. Neodymium magnets appear in high-quality products such as microphones, professional loudspeakers, in-ear headphones and computer hard disks where low mass, small volume, or strong magnetic fields are required. \nProbably because of similarities to Ca2+, Nd3+ has been reported [1] to promote plant growth. Rare earth element compounds are frequently used in China as fertilizer. \nSize and strength of volcanic eruption can be predicted by scanning for neodymium isotopes. Small and large volcanic eruptions produce lava with different neodymium isotope composition. From the composition of isotopes, scientists predict how big the coming eruption will be, and use this information to warn residents of the intensity of the eruption. \nCertain transparent materials with a small concentration of neodymium ions can be used in lasers as gain media for infrared wavelengths (1054-1064 nm), e.g. Nd:YAG (yttrium aluminium garnet), Nd:YLF (yttrium lithium fluoride), Nd:YVO4 (yttrium orthvanadate), and Nd:glass. The current laser at the UK Atomic Weapons Establishment (AWE), the HELEN 1-TW neodymium-glass laser, can access the midpoints of pressure and temperature regions and is used to acquire data for modelling on how density, temperature and pressure interact inside warheads. HELEN can create plasmas of around 106 K, from which opacity and transmission of radiation are measured. \nNeodymium glass (Nd:Glass) solid-state lasers are used in extremely high power (terawatt scale), high energy (megajoules) multiple beam systems for inertial confinement fusion. Nd:Glass lasers are usually frequency tripled to the third harmonic at 351 nm in laser fusion	Science & Mathematics

Why can't we replace atmospheric ozone depletion? . Many people hear about atmospheric ozone depletion and wonder why we don't simply replace the ozone that has been destroyed.  Knowing about chlorofluorocarbons and knowing how catalysts work, explain how this would not be a lasting solution. . ozone is naturally replaced anyway, but the reaction between chlorofluorocarbons is much much faster than the rate of ozone production (free radicals on chlorine molecules extremely reactive, about 1 million times more reactive than the oxygen atoms involved in ozone production) so the rate of depletion would still be higher.

I'm just really curious? . Can someone please explain to me the meaning of mormon undergarments, what they look like, why are they such a pain, and who has to wear them (male/female)?? I'm just really curious!!!!!!!!! . I am a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints. Your question is a good one, and a concept that is often misunderstood by the rest of the world. \n\nAll adult members, male and female, of the church who enter the Temple are required to wear garments. They are white (similar to an undershirt and briefs) to symbolize purity and knee length to help assure modesty in dress and action. They are symbolic of Paul's words to put on the whole armor of God (Ephesians 6:13). The garment is an outward expression of an inward covenant, much like a member of the clergy who wears a collar or a Christian who wears a cross. They also serve as a reminder of the covenants that we have made to be disciples of Christ, being obedient and faithful to our Savior's teachings. They are not intended to be secret, only sacred.\n\nI hope that this helps. Let me know if I can be of further assistance.	Society & Culture

"Does this sound like a mental illness? . I have a SIL that is constantly wanting to move.  In the last year she has suddenly announced she wants to move several times and started making plans! She has actually moved briefly 200 miles away from her family (she is married and has 2 college age children at home) and got a job. Mediocre jobs, mind you as she is not educated and her husband is the bread winner with a decent job. She is also a job hopper and quits within weeks.  This is taking a toll on her family and causing stress on them but she won't get help. Usually, they just let her go on her way and she eventually comes home disallusioned. That is until the other day she convinced the family to move south.  \nDoes this sound like depression or something else""  I think she is chasing happiness that she will never find.  \nThere is no good reason for these moves, either. No job, etc.  Just running away?\nHow can the family help her?  \nThanks! . I would say she has  a serious problem.  She is very immature -- number one. She definitely needs help of the professional kind.  I know her family cares about her, but this kind of person only is concerned about her own self and how she can meet her own needs - no matter how odd they might be - and at the expence of her own families welfare. She needs a strong husband to stand up and say enough is enough.   And to tell her if she refuses to get the help she needs, then  he can no longer support her - emotionally or financially.  What kind of example is she setting for her children. Her husband should also think of that.  His kids are more important than the pathological relationship he has with his wife."	Health

"For Christians. Will I go to hell according to you ? . I believe that I am basically a good person. I work hard, I look after my family. I try to help anyone whenever I can.

how do we prouve that the volume due to a rotation of 360degrees of an area is integral of pi*[f(x)]^2*dx? .  . You need some theory background first. Integration is most rigorously defined as a sum of an infinite number of rectangles that start on the x-axis and stretch up or down to the function (called a Riemann sum). The rectangles are infinitely thin, but each one still has area length * width, and integration is merely the sum of the areas of all those rectangles.\n\nImagine a rectangle is attached to the x-axis, and the x-axis acts as an axle, so you can spin the rectangle around that axle. The spinning rectangle will look like a cylinder whose radius is the height of the rectangle and whose width is the width of the rectangle (the amount touching the axis). \n\nThe area of a cylinder is pi * r^2 * w. As I stated, the radius is the height of the rectangle, which stretches from the x-axis (y=0) to the function (y=f(x)). Subtract those y-values to get the radius: f(x)-0=f(x). So, r=f(x).\n\npi * r^2 * w = pi * [f(x)]^2 * w\n\nThe width of the cylinder is how much is touching the x-axis and is usually represented by delta-x.  However, when an infinite number of rectangles are used, you use dx instead.\n\npi * [f(x)]^2 * dx\n\nSo, just like the definite integral from a to b of f(x)dx gives you the sum of the areas of the infinite rectangles beneath f(x), the definite integral from a to b of pi * [f(x)]^2 * dx is equal to the volume of the cylinders created when those rectangles are rotated.

You could also talk about the tension on the ropes or chains and explain how the force is perpendicular to the direction of motion and therefore causes a circular or arced path.  It seems obvious because the ropes have a set length, but this is the exact same phenomenon that keeps the earth in orbit.  The gravitational force is perpendicular to the diretion of the earth's movement (on average, of course.  Since the actual orbit is elliptical, it's not a perfect analogy).	Science & Mathematics

is absolute beauty exist? .  . in the natural world animals develop features to attract a mate - the ones with the most perfect features (according, i assume, to their instinctive values of attraction) are the most attractive as mates. it works to ensure that the strongest/best examples of a species reproduce together, to ensure in turn that the species survives. so yes, in the natural world, an inherent concept of absolute beauty would appear to exist.\n\nhowever.\n\ndifferent animals develop different features, showing that each species has a different concept of beauty. also, in relation to human beings, it's important to remember that we have as a species gone beyond the trials of survival which necessitate mate selection in the natural world - in our secure society we can afford to be attracted to any number of things other than physical strength, cunning, childbearing suitability etc. \n\nso, in short, no, a universal concept of absolute beauty does not exist. on an individual level, i'd say that it does exist, but not only is it different in different people; it is constantly changing as we experience new things which alter our perception of the world.

It is so easy not to start smoking or drinking, so why do so many people do it? . I personally believe that it is too easy NOT to begin smoking cigarettes or drinking alcohol (and not to mention abusing drugs).  Sure, there is peer pressure and people become stressed.  But each individual is fully capable of managing stress without resorting to such unhealthy habits.   We were made to be able to cope naturally.  Smoking and drinking are simply too dangerous for excuses.  I'm stressed out all the time; in fact, I get stressed out at the drop of a hat.  But I have no desire or need to do these things, even if they are readily available.  They are obviously extremely addictive and put users at much higher risk for cancer and other diseases.  And how many people kill themselves and others while driving drunk?  I would also like to know why exactly 18 year-olds (and younger) consider themselves old enough to drink.  They're not, I'm not.  It's illegal, simple as that.  We underestimate the dangers of these habits.  My main point is:  it's just too easy to avoid them. . It's easy to start, hard to stop, and some people think its cool so they do it to try and impress them to be cool too. So, its generally peer pressure that starts it and then that person finds out the benefits and ignores the long term damages, and keeps doing alcohol or drugs or whichever, until they are so addicted its almost impossible to stop before they die. Thats why when they go through a serious condition (heart attack) and are hospitilized, then told they have to stop its much more likely that they will rather than stopping on their own.	Health

Why do so many people equate being a christian with belief in GOD and anyone who is not Christian is atheist? . Certainly, all Christians must believe in GOD but many non-Christians also have strong religious beliefs, including a belief in GOD but do not necessarily buy the myths of the Christian religion.  Like Jews. Jesus himself was not a CHRISTIAN as they are known today. He was different from the folks who claim to follow his beliefs. he did not believe in anger or spite or hatred or killing. he believed and practiced love and forgiveness that was deep and abiding. How many Christians actually follow his teachings? Most use the Jewish Bible to justify their actions. this is the same bible that jesus rejected.\nThe majority of god-believing religious people on planet earth are NOT Christians. So please explain to me why I keep seeing answers that imply that anyone who does not accept Jesus as their personal savior and think he was the one and only son of God who was  sacrificed to save us from our sins and was raised from the dead as a miracle to prove that he is the one and only,is atheist . You will keep seeing Christian answers saying Jesus is our Savior, and all that you said because that is what we believe. Just as much as you and all other religions believe otherwise.

"is there software that will write C++ code automatically? .  . It depends. There are packages out there that will convert UML to C++ code or many other types of code such as Java or SQL that you then run through a compiler or interpreter. Can it do that for a PC application? Probably no. Can it do that for general applications? Probably yes. Is it a good idea? That is a loaded question. It is definitely a programming paradigm shift, modifications and maintenance may be more difficult but on the other hand good requirements analysis and documentation are required since they ""are"" the code.

I need help, I'm 16 & argue with my boyfriend all the time for no reason! how can i calm things down a bit? . I really like him and want to stay with him! But i keep picking at things he does and he's really immature infront of his friends. . Ok well some of these answers are just plain stupid. Geez arguments happen in every relationship people if you break up everytime you encounter an argurment or disagreement you will be looking for that right guy forever.\n\nFirst off, both of you need to just lighten up. I don't know what you are fighting about but many times arguments happen because of stupid disagreements (this is most often the case in younger relationships). Listen to what he has to say, have him listen to what you have to say. Try and find a compromise. The best couples are the ones that are willing to compromise (give a little to get a little). It doesn't always have to be one person's way or another.\n\nSecondly, he is 16, he is going to be immature. Some girls are too at that age. Hell I know girls that are in their early teens that are immature and some guys too. Just remember he may be 16 but he is still a youth. Give it some time and try and help him along rather than confront him on it.\n\nFinally if none of this works, weigh the pros and cons of the relationship. Can you see yourself with this guy in 5 years, 3 years, hell 1 year from now and more importantly do you want to.\n\nBEst of luck with everything.	Family & Relationships

Frequency of pitch in a cup of tea? . If you tap the rim of your cup with a spoon, you get differently pitched tones - the rim by the handle and the opposite section are the same tone, and the ones inbetween are different, but the same as each other. This seems to work on all cups but it easier to discern in a bone china mug. If you tap all the way round, the tone goes up and down in quarter sections. Why's that then? . I guess that where you tap the cup is important. The ringing sound will be generated by the energy you put in from the tap. The tone is dependent on the internal volume at the point where you tap, and the thickness of the cup where you are tapping.\n\nIf it were a cylinder I guess that it would produce an even tone all over, maybe you should try that?\n\nFar from being boring this is an interesting question about harmonics, I am off to the kitchen, with a spoon...

What is the 13th zodiac?? .  . Ophiuchus is often mistakenly called the 'thirteenth sign of the zodiac' because the sign is thought of as an additional sign to the the twelve Tropical or Sidereal signs. \n\nIn fact, Ophiuchus is a Sun-sign in the Real Solar Zodiac, i.e. the Sun can be seen against the stars of Ophiuchus between 30th November and 17th December each year. [The dates of the cusps move a little from one year to the next, so sometimes they are quoted as 1st December to 18th December.] Aquarius, the Water Carrier, is the actual 13th, and last, sign of the Real Solar Zodiac.\n \n \n\nOphiuchus the Sun sign. The curved line marked with degree signs is the Ecliptic. The Ecliptic, the Sun's path through the heavens as seen from Earth, runs through Ophiuchus from about 245 to 265Â° away from the Vernal Equinox. This means that the Sun can be seen against the stars of Ophiuchus from 30th November to 17th December\n \nOphiuchus in the Planetary Zodiac: As Ophiuchus is a Sun-sign it is also a member of the Planetary Zodiac and the Lunar Zodiac, i.e. as well as the Sun, the planets and the Moon can frequently be seen against the stars of Ophiuchus, from the view point of the Earth.\n\nThe planet Pluto could be found in Ophiuchus until the end of 2003, after which it passed into Serpens Cauda, the Serpent's Tail. The Centaur object, the minor planetoid Chiron, was visible against the stars of Ophiuchus until November 2001, after which it passed over the border into Sagittarius. Venus and Mercury can be found in Ophiuchus for a time each year. Shown right is an example of a star chart for Pluto in Ophiuchus in June 1999.\n\nSo why isn't Ophiucus in the Commonly-Used Western Zodiac? Ophiuchus is an Ancient Greek constellation. The Serpent Bearer is one of the original Ptolemy constellations, appearing in Al Magest Star Catalogue [c 130 - 170 AD]. He also appears on the Farnese Globe, a Roman copy of a circa 2nd century BC depiction of Atlas holding the Celestial Sphere above his head. So why isn't Ophiuchus a member of the standard astrological zodiac - the Tropical Zodiac? \n\nGood question! Ophiuchus is a Sun-sign. The Moon and planets all are seen against the stars of Ophiuchus. Unfortunately, the answer to the question is that Ophiuchus isn't in the Tropical Zodiac not because there is something wrong with Ophiuchus but because there is something wrong with the Tropical Zodiac.  The Tropical Zodiac  is an inaccurate oversimplification of the heavens dating from a time when we did not have telescopes or computers.	Entertainment & Music

why do the pharmaceutical company's put mercury in vaccines if they know mercury is toxic? .  . Mercury is cheaper to produce and, thus, saves overhead.

I agree though, Mercury, in significant amounts, can cause serious brain damage and even mental retardation if a person is exposed to a sample of mercury for too long or if the sample is large enough.

"Why do Protestants only have two sacraments? . Why do Protestants only have two sacraments? . Assuming that you're in reference to baptism and the Lord's supper its because they claim to see only these two in the Bible, and the Bible supposedly being their sole guide in faith and practice, those are the only ones they keep. But not all stop at two. Some keep foot washing as an ordinance, others like the Lutherans actually have confession available for those who desire to avail themselves of it, and some think of ordination as a sacrament. But then there's that other side of the coin too. Strictly speaking a ""sacrament"" gives grace. Most protestants don't believe that and refer to such practices as church ordinances. I know ...

i have severe pain in the lower left side of my abdomen. any ideas? .  . If you haven't had this pain for a long time or if it only come every once in a while it could actually be stress.  Your muscles in your abdomen may be spasming.  Or it could be a cyst on your ovary.\n\nI had a very, very severe pain in my left abdomen once and I ended up going to the emergency room.  They told me it was a kidney stone, but that turned out to be wrong.  Then my general practitioner told me it was a cyst on my ovary bursting, but after doing an ultrasound we found out that was wrong too.  So, I finally went to my gynecologist and she said it was probably just a muscle spasm.  So, she gave me some muscle relaxers for everytime it acts up and everything has been fine ever since.	Health

If space is a vacuum, wouldn't spacecrafts implode rather than explode? .  . To allow any astronauts  on board to breathe, the cabin would be be pressurized with a breathable atmosphere.  This internal pressure would be greater than the (very tiny) pressure outside the spacecraft.  And just like increasing the pressure inside a balloon by blowing into it causes it to expand, this increased pressure inside the spacecraft would, if there was a catastrophic failure of some kind, cause the space craft to explode rather than implode.  The exact opposite happens to submarines that are deep underwater.  If something happens to a submarine at depth, it will implode as the pressure of the water around it is greater than the pressure of the interior spaces.	Science & Mathematics

"how long is it healthy to use a computer per day? .  . Since 1977 I have professionally used computers. My vision is 20/20. I do not have Carpal Tunnel Syndrome. I do not have back problems, either. I do however have a neck problem that is caused by a disease not related to computer usage and is aggravated by the usage.\n\nI believe if you practice good work habits like:\n   1) Sitting straight with arms parallel to upper legs. Feet flat on the floor.\n   2) Not reaching out to use mouse and keyboard.\n   3) Having proper ambient lighting.\n   4) Taking regular breaks--walk and stretch.\n   5) Ensuring monitor is near head level (so that your head doesn't tilt down or up more too much).\n\nSome people believe that monitors radiate electromagnetic emissions...

"How come I want to be saved but everytime I try and pray I dont feel like I am saved? .  . Being saved isn't a ""feeling"" it's trusting in the truth contained in God's Word. Have you walked the Roman Road?\n\nThe ROMANS ROAD....is a pathway you can walk.\n\nIt is a group of Bible verses from the book of Romans in the New Testament. If you walk down this road you will end up understanding how to be saved. \n\nRomans 3:23 ""For all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God.""\n\nWe all have sin in our hearts. We all were born with sin. \n\nWe were born under the power of sin's control.\n\n- Admit that you are a sinner.\n\n\n\nRomans 6:23a ""...The wages of sin is death..."" \n\nSin has an ending. It results in death. We all face physical death, which is a result of sin. But a worse death is spiritual death that alienates us from God, and will last for all eternity. The Bible teaches that there is a place called the Lake of Fire where lost people will be in torment forever. It is the place where people who are spiritually dead will remain.\n\n- Understand that you deserve death for your sin.\n\nRomans 6:23b ""...But the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord."" \n\nSalvation is a free gift from God to you! You can't earn this gift, but you must reach out and receive it.\n\n- Ask God to forgive you and save you.\n\nRomans 5:8, ""God demonstrates His own love for us, in that while we were yet sinners Christ died for us!""\n\nWhen Jesus died on the cross He paid sin's penalty. He paid the price for all sin, and when He took all the sins of the world on Himself on the cross, He bought us out of slavery to sin and death! The only condition is that we believe in Him and what He has done for us, understanding that we are now joined with Him, and that He is our life. He did all this because He loved us and gave Himself for us!\n\n- Give your life to God... His love poured out in Jesus on the cross is your only hope to have forgiveness and change. His love bought you out of being a slave to sin. His love is what saves you -- not religion, or church membership. God loves you!\n\nRomans 10:13 ""Whoever will call on the name of the Lord will be saved!"" \n\n- Call out to God in the name of Jesus!\n\nRomans 10:9,10 ""...If you confess with your mouth Jesus as Lord, and believe in your heart that God raised Jesus from the dead, you shall be saved; for with the heart man believes, resulting in righteousness, and with the mouth he confesses, resulting in salvation.""\n\n- If you know that God is knocking on your heart's door, ask Him to come into your heart. \n\nJesus said,\n\nRevelation 3:20a ""Behold I stand at the door and knock, if anyone hears My voice and opens the door, I will come in to him..."" \n\n- Is Jesus knocking on your heart's door?\n\nBelieve in Him. Ask Him to come in to your heart by faith,\nand ask Him to reveal Himself to you. Open the Bible to the Gospel of John and read what God says about Jesus, about you, and about being born again. \n\nGod will help you. He loves you. \n\nYou need to look for a local church where God's word is preached. The Bible says that we are to desire God's word like a newborn baby desires mother's milk.\n\nAren't you hungry to know the truth?\n\nWater baptism is one of the ways you first show that you have been joined to Jesus. This is an action, and actions will not save you. However, it is an act of obedience and a symbol of commitment.\n\nThe symbolism is this: When you go down in the water you show that You have been crucified and buried with Him,\n\nAnd when you come up out of the water you show that you have been raised to walk with Him in newness of life. \n\n(See Romans chapter 6)\n\nYou have been born again. \n\n(See John chapter 3)\n\nYour body has become God's temple. Your heart is where He lives. Forgiveness is yours in Jesus. And you belong to Him.\n\nYou were sin's slave.\n\nBut now...\n\nYou are a child of GOD!\n\nJohn 1:12 &quot"	Society & Culture

Ok. say for instance I make 12$ an hour..after tax thats taking home 8$ an hour..some illegals who work in my trade pay no taxes..and they make about 10$ an hour..technically making less hourly than me..but taking home more. this is what bothers me. Where 25% of tax payers money goes to taxes..illegals pay none..imagine how much money America would make is they just let them all have visas..and tax them. Thats the only problem I have, I'm not racist towards anyone. I just have a problem with the money issue. . I am amazed by the ignorance in the responses in this thread.\n\nThe only taxes illegals pay is sales tax, assuming they purchase goods here.  Some of them pay an income tax with a fake social security number, but you should research their reasoning behind doing that before giving them a pat on the back.  If it cost them anything by using a fake SSN, they wouldn't do it.  Chew on that. \n\nThe lower price I might pay for strawberries and a trimmed lawn is peanuts compared to the taxes I pay to put illegals' kids through school, provide them meals, pay their hospital bills, and paying to keep a large majority of them in prison.  This is causing my state (California) to go bankrupt.  The burden illegals place on the economy is FAR greater than anything they may provide to aid the economy.\n\nThe government needs to ENFORCE its laws in an effort to alleviate the problem.

What do you understand by density-gradient centrifugation? .  . YOu have one force pulling things in one direction.  This is a centrifugal force due to spinning and pulls the suspended things to the center.\nThen you have viscous and frictional forces that retard the exodus of materials to the center.\nIf these two forces are matched you reach a terminal velocity.\nWhen you have a density gradient, what you actually have is a gradient of retarding forces.  Remember that density is related to viscosity.\nEvery particle has a different value for an effective force that will be accelerating it towards the center.  If it reaches a layer where the retarding forces equal this force it will essentially stop accelerating.	Science & Mathematics

What are some reasons for women to turn to prostitution? . does abuse as a child have something to do with it or lack of self confidence? . Abuse and lack of confidence might play some role in making it easier for them to accept. But if you talk to many who have gotten out of the life, they will tell you that they were recruited by deceiving freinds who enticed them into having sex, then got them hooked on drugs for control, then once they were hooked, told them that they would have their drug supply cut off if they didn't have sex for money. They were often told that it would be just once, and they gave in. Then they were forced to do it over and over again. Whatever beating, starving, was used, also contributed to this.\n\nThere are many reasons, but most of them seem to follow a pattern like this. This is why pimps often try to target young girls who have run away from home and foolishly accept the offer of someone to take care of them and give them a place to stay without and 'strings' attached. They find out later that is not true.\n\nThe pimps break down the girls' self-confidence (or target ones with little to start) and abuse them to make them dependent on the pimps.\n\nI'm sorry to be so blunt about this, but it is true. The entire thing is ugly, but it is too bad to be false. This is why they call it 'white slavery'. It IS slavery. Pimps should be killed, not praised like rappers do. Anybody who thinks otherwise simply doesn't know what they are really like, or maybe they are on the side of the pimps. If they praise pimps without really knowing what they do to the girls, they are supporting the pimps without realizing it.\n\nAs for rumors that some girls start as prostitutes without some external pressure, I suppose that must happen, but I would tend to think that is extremely rare. It may be that abuse and lack of confidence are the greatest factors in those rare cases. But by far, more women turn to prostitution under pressure by a pimp than otherwise.	Society & Culture

have you ever seen ppl being bullied or ignored because they are asian or black? . i have seen some asian girl being ignored in the class by other white girls. do you have a similar experience and how did you feel about it? . firstly, are you sure you're not one of those girls? Don't take offense, im not trying to insult you. It's just that you referred to her as 'some asian girl'. If you feel bad about her being ignored, that's a good thing. it means you have a heart. but just think about how she must be feeling. Try talking to her, be nice to her. Mind u, i'm not saying to be nice out of pity. but if you never try speaking to her, you may never know what sort of a friend you're missing out on.\nAt my school, we had a lot of international students from the asian region. They could all speak english pretty well, but they tended to keep to themselves. But i still spoke to some of them and some of them ended up becoming quite good friends of mine. Don't be afraid to break through the barriers. loneliness is one of the saddest things a person has to face. There is too much going on in this world for us to tolerate racism. It's when we allow racism to succeed that we get events like the Holocaust, and the Stallinist purges.\nReach out to her. She's human too, and for all you know, friendship from you could be just what she needs. Never underestimate the need for friendship. Don't worry about what other people think of you if you do this. Being nice to someone has its own rewards, and it's the right thing to do.	Family & Relationships

If your husband can afford to take you to court, you need to be on your toes.  A highly paid lawyer can turn the smallest things into a custody issue. Stupid things like feeding your kids McDonald's instead of home cooked food, or if they are left in daycare too long or with a babysitter while you work.  If you smoke around your children and your husband doesn't.  Also, courts frown upon parents having boyfriends/girlfriends around the children, especially if you live together.  If you live with a boyfriend and your husband doesn't live with a girlfriend, a good lawyer can get your kids taken away because your home is immoral. I am not saying any of these things apply to you, just trying to show you the types of things the court will look at.  CPS is one thing, but fighting against a good lawyer is another.

while getting up from a deep sleep, I could not stand on my legs and was falling down. Why? Serious answer pl? .  . I work in a sleep lab and I have seen this before, it is called sleep paralysis.  It is very normal and every night your body goes into a mini coma when in your deep rem sleep.  Sometimes you get up from rem too quick and your body has not recovered yet.  Maybe you took medications that made your rem sleep more dominant, or maybe your not sleeping long enough.  This problem usually is seen in older patients and patients on certain medications.

Serious Sleeping Problems??? . I've been having problems getting to sleep, and often lay awake for hours. Ive no stress have a happy life and nothing to worry about!! Been to the docs he gave me  sleeping tablets called temazapam which worked really well, but he wont give me any more, as there addictive, what else can i do????? I have been like this for over a year!! . Could be a hormonal imbalance. Get you hormones tested--especially your adrenal glands, with a saliva test (done at home, very easy to do). These are more accurate than blood tests, as they measure hormone levels at the cellular/tissue level. Most orthodox/establishment MDs are not aware of this. Finding a good alternative medicine MD or naturopathic physician will help you along this path. It might have been better for your MD to have recommended a more natural sleep aid, but again, they are not educated in this way.\n\nHomeopathics, herbs, Bach Flower Remedies, may help, but you really must have the cause determined by a competent and thorough professional. Although these substances are natural, they are not candy!\n\nAlso, if you drink coffee or caffeinated beverages, you may want to stop/reduce your intake,  or at least do not consume them after 1 or 2 PM. \n\nSome references below, for you. Good Luck and Sweet Dreams!	Health
"OUTLOOK is forever shutting down my curser and ""Requesting Data"" from my company's server.? . This happens like every 2 or 3 minutes.  It is aggrevating as Hell.  Does my administrator need a lesson or do I?  Can anyone tell me what to do to make the ""requesting"" less frequent? . This is due to outlook trying to connect to your company's Exchange server and having network troubles doing so.  This is a problem for the admin.  You cannot control the communication timing when using the direct connection to the Exchange server.  There are a few potential causes:\nNetwork is very busy.\nPoor network connection (e.g. low signal on wireless).\nServer is very busy.\n\nIf the admin cannot solve these problems, one thing you can do is setup your system to use offline folders.  Basically Outlook makes a copy of your mail data on your computer and occasionally gets an update from the server.\n\nWith help from your admin, go to the Microsoft Exchange Server settings and hit the advanced tab.  You will see a button labelled ""Offline server settings"".  Choose a location for the .ost file and hit OK.\nOn the General tab there is a section called ""When Starting"".  Select Manually control connection state and change the default to ""work offline"".\n\nNow when you go to tools and options, you should see a ""Send/Receive"" button on the ""Mail Setup"" tab.  There you can schedule how often Outlook synchronizes with the server.\n\nI haven't filled in every last detail, you should get assistance from your admin before attempting this."

How dose such a heavy ship flouts? .  . How does a ship float? Well, some ships are made of wood, and wood floats, so in that case is easy to understand. What about ships made of heavy steel, though? Or the concrete ships (above) that were constructed during a steel shortage at the end of WWI? Steel and concrete are heavier that water, how do they float? \n\nA ship will float as long as it weighs less than the water it pushes out of way, or displaces. Ships can use materials in their hulls that are heavier than water, but there must be air within the ship. Since the air doesn't weigh as much as the water, this lowers the weight of the ship compared to the same volume of water. Try this experiment to see how trapping air in a ship can make it float. You will need a lump of clay and a sink filled with water. \n\nSTEP 1 - Roll the clay into a ball and place it in the sink. Does it float? It shouldn't because the clay weighs more than the water. \n\nSTEP 2 - Now shape the clay into a rounded cup and put a small lump on the bottom as a keel. Put it in the water with the open part of the cup facing up so it stays filled with air. Does it sink? It shouldn't. As long as the bowl of the cup is large enough and contains air the clay will float. This is because the air makes the clay ship weigh less than the water it displaces. \n\nSTEP 3 - Now fill the bowl of the cup with water. Does it sink? It should. When the bowl is filled with water the clay ship weighs more than the water it displaces and sinks. \n\nWhen a ship floats it is said to have positive buoyancy. When it sinks it has negative buoyancy. \n\nFor another buoyancy experiment try the pencap submarine.	Science & Mathematics

Do you prefer your scrotum hairy or shaven? . Is it ghey to shave your sack? . No, it's not gay to shave down there, it feels good for you and it's much nicer for your partner.\n\nIf you're going to shave your pubic area, you need to do it every day (which is no hassle really, it only takes 5 minutes).  Doing this will almost completely prevent stubble and bumps.\n\nI recommend that you have a soapy shower, dry thoroughly, apply talc and shave with a single or dual foil electric shaver. Doing it every day means you stay virtually smooth all the time, which is a lovely feeling (for you and anyone else that it may concern). The talc is important because it lets the shaver glide softly and easily over your skin, giving you a smooth comfortable shave, unlike a harsh razor.\n\nI would never consider using chemicals on such a delicate part of the body, and waxing sounds *way* too painful - Far better to shave or (if you can afford it) go for one of the permanent hair removal treatments.

I Believe U should ask your doctor for an XRAY for your shouldier,& in most cases U will need to have an MRI, for your doctor to  ""Really Discover the true source of your pain"". If your current doctor does not respond get another opinion. The Physical pain & Associated symptoms does NOT in any way suggest that it is Anxiety or  Depression,the fact you have put up with this wrenching pain for 6 months suggests,you have something PHYSICALLY wrong with your shouldier.Don't let this doctor fob you off like this ok. The symptoms you r describing could be either[ a torn ligament,in which case only an MRI will show this up]or  very briused and damaged muscle's & tendons around your shouldier, The numbness is trying to tell your physical body,your blood circulation is being restricted to the areas you have mentioned.The fact that  your 2 upper and lower ribs r also affected tells me you have a Physical  Medical Ailment,Definitely Nothing to do with anxiety or depression.You need to have exrays and possably an MRI coving ALL your affected areas. Sweetheart NO IT IS NOT IN YOUR HEAD OK. Hope U get the medical tests & treatment you ""REALLY NEED""     Love & care\n ps.or you could have a very small fracture in this shouldier,they R hard to detect,so U need to be FIRM Medically about your Shouldier.

Loved those books (the early ones, they got a bit mixed later on) and I have a tatoo of a Draconian on my left arm...\n\nOf course the ultimate fantasy book in my opinion that would be ripe for the live action treatment (or even animation for that matter) would have to be The Silmarillion.

I would go with Walker and here's why. Williams is in a better pass offense, Denver lives and dies with the run game, but Shanahan HATES the Raiders. I believe they still owe him money when he use to coach for them so he always tries to blow them out. The Raiders can't run and they gave up 9 sacks to Seattle.  Niners have Gore and they have shown flashes that they can move the ball with Bryant and Battle through the air.	Sports

Do police make there databases of this sort public? . nothing that is available to the public. Yes law enforcement has a database. Serial numbers of property get entered when stolen like a vin/plate of a stolen car. If property is recovered by law enforcement they can run it in the system and it will come back with a hit if the serial number has been entered. Do you suspect you have stolen property in your possession? If you do take it down to your local police station and explain that you have this in your possession and want to be sure it was not stolen. Be honest with them because they will ask how you got it and who/where you got it from.	Politics & Government
"What was ""The Gilded Age"" and why was it called that? .  . Where the term, Gilded Age came from was American author Mark Twain.  He used the term to describe the culture of the newly rich, lacking tradition, the wealthy became showy as their counterparts in upper-class Europe.  This was the age when enormous mansions imitated European palaces.  The mansions were filled with works of art, antiques, rare books and very gaudy decor.  These wealthy Americans spent their leisure time attending operas, relaxing at luxurious resorts because they believed they were signs of refinement.  \n\nThe average Americans enjoyed fairs that exhibited industrial machines, the latest inventions and other American progress.  The fairs included the Philadelphia Centennial Exposition of 1876, and the Chicago World's Columbian Exposition of 1893.  Americans attended circuses, vaudeville shows and sporting events.  Baseball becamse so popular after 1900, it became a term we use today,"" national pastime"".  \n\nAmerica exploded with playing popular songs from sheet music on parlor pianos, played records on phonographs, and bought inexpensive books that emphasized adventure and the value of hard work and courage."

"why is the sea blue? .  . Why is the sea blue? Why is glacier ice blue? Why is the sky blue?\n\nPeople should just summarize this as: Why are large natural semitransparent masses usually blue. The answer has always to do with the nature of light. \n\nAlthough people are not totally full of it when they claim that water can appear blue due to reflection from the sky, the fact is that even when the sky isn't blue, water can appear bluish.\n\nThe reason is that water (and the other semitransparent media I described above) absorbs lower energy photons (light) easier than it absorbs higher energy ones. What we call ""blue"" is just higher energy photons, which are more likely to be scattered or reflected than absorbed. This is why you see blue when you look at deep water, glacier ice, or the sky."

I've been married before to a real jerk.  I've found someone nice.  Should I marry again if he asks? . The man to whom I was married before verbally and physically abused me for several years.  I had very low self-esteem after the divorce and dated a lot of people who were not for me.  Some were nice, but our personalities didn't match or...for whatever reason.  However, now I've found a man who has every characteristic for which I have been looking for years, and my family (who agrees that he is a good man, by the way), says that I'm too quick to jump, and that I need to see other people instead of just settling down with him.  I don't think seeing someone for a year is too quick to jump.  We've talked about marriage, but the question has not been asked.  If he does ask soon, though, even going against my family's better judgement, should I marry him?  I know that I do love him...and it's been a long time coming! . If you feel you are ready take the offer.  You are marrying him, not your family.  You may kiss many frogs to find your prince.  If it feels right and you are sure about yourself and have confidence in this relationship after getting bashed in the last, then why ask?  Good luck!	Family & Relationships

I had bad influence (outside the family) and i began talking back with my mom. and not showing her that i love her. Im 15 and now, i never say I love you to my mom, and i always end up arguing with her somehow. i don't want to, i hate my self for doing it. but when ever i talk with her it seems like i fall into an argument and i hurt her. Im the nicest person to everyone in the worldd, except her. \n\nHow can i stop this? any mothers please help. i don't want to hurt her anymore. . First, I am a mother.  You need to think about what you are going to say before you say it. Remember she is the only mother you will have.  Also, try to explain to your mom how you are feeling.  This may help take away some of the frustrations you have.  I was a teenager once, I did alot of aruging with my mom as a teenager and it was about how i felt she was treating my brother a lot better than me, ect, which by the way she did, and now admits.  I ended up moving in with my dad and step monster, oops step mother, and It was find for like 4 months, then she showed her real colors.  It might not seem like it now, but try and talk with your mom, explain that you are just frustrated, and you need to tell her how you feel. I actually thought I hated my mom for many years, but now that I am older, I realize that i didn't hate her, I just did not like her actions, and the decisions she made.	Society & Culture

"How do you know if you have to get Tommy John surgery? .  . ""The doctors call it a UCL â ulnar collateral ligament reconstruction.  \n\n**As the success rate of the surgery increases, so does the number of cases. Ten years ago, doctors were more likely to recommend rest for a partial ligament tear. The numbers now favor surgery. \n\nBaseball players and fans call it Tommy John surgery, after the pitcher who was the first to have the surgery 29 years ago.  The surgical procedure hasn't changed much since it was pioneered by Frank Jobe for John in 1974. A tendon is removed from the patient's wrist or hamstring and grafted into the elbow â woven in a figure-eight pattern through tunnels drilled in the humerus and ulna bones.  The surgery requires a full year of rehabilitation and typically another year pitching before returning to pre-injury form.  Essentially, the body must convert a tendon into a ligament, get it carrying blood again and train it to start working as a ligament. (A ligament connects bones, stabilizing a joint. A tendon attaches muscle to the bone.) It is very weak immediately after the surgery, and the rebuilding process must be gradual.  The elbow is immobilized in a hard brace for about a week, then the patient begins exercises to regain limited range of motion the second week. By the second or third week, he can use the arm for everyday tasks like eating and combing his hair.  He can start swinging a golf club after three months and usually begin a light-tossing program at four months."""	Sports

Its killing me not knowing more answers already, lol.  Any thoughts anyone? . A. No, not every single town in the US has latinos. Mine doesn't. \nB. Many areas in the midwest, particularly in sparsely populated farming areas, have only 1 hospital. They would be lucky if it was actually in their town and not 50 miles away. Rural hospitals are closing all the time, because few of the people they serve have health insurance and they can't afford to stay open.\nC. I think both jake and the black guy are former government employees. Gray anderson is a bad guy, but not in a terrorist way - he wants to take control of the local government and turn it into a big brother fascist type operation - he will have to deal with eric and jake and their mom, who want to preserve democracy and abide by the rules of the constitution, even during this emergency situation. i think thats going to be the real conflict in the show - the rebuilding of society where the normal rules dont apply - you have to make your own, and what are they going to be?"

Do I need 3 years warranty upgrade for my HP Laptop? . I purchased a HP DV4000 Series Laptop which has i yr Int Warranty. Do I need to purchase a warranty upgrade to 3yrs Int warranty? Do you think it's good? . Depends upon how critical the laptop is in your situation.  In most cases I would not buy it.  Usually they cost about 15% of the original list price of the laptop for each years extended warrranty.  \n\nA small percentage of the laptops have hardware related failures.  The odds are in your favor unless you drop it or travel with it a lot.  If you can write it off as a business expense that might make the cost more appealing.\n\nSo, figure out how much it will cost and figure in 2-3 years new laptops will most likely be less expensive or at least the same price with more features.  In most cases, unless the laptop is critical to your day-to-day business I would not spend the money.	Computers & Internet

"What is the formula to find number of diagonals in an octagon? . and also formula to find number of diagonals in polygons? . The question apparently is ""How many diagonals does a polygon with n sides have?""  \n\nThe first formula is n(n-3)/2.  \nOne way to see this is to notice that you can draw (n-3) diagonals from every vertex of the polygon. This is because there are (n-1) other vertices, but two of them are adjacent vertices and so don't count towards making diagonals. This seems to give n(n-2) diagonals, but this way of counting counts every diagonal twice since each diagonal connects to two vertices, so you have to divide by 2.\n\nBy a recursive formula, we mean a way of expressing the answer for n vertices in terms of the answer for n-1 vertices. Suppose, for example, that you already know the answer for a polygon with n-1 vertices. Now if you add another vertex between two of the vertices of the original polygon, then all the diagonals of the original polygon will still be diagonals of the new polygon, and so will the side joining the two vertices that you added a new vertex between, and so will the line segments joining the new vertex to all the other vertices of the original polygon. (Got all that?) So if we let diag(n) be the number of diagonals for a polygon with n sides, we get the formula:\n\n        diag(n) = diag(n-1) + n - 3 + 1 or\n\n                  diag(n-1) + n - 2\n\nThe first formula is better, since it actually gives you the answer.  \nBut sometimes it's easier to get a recursive formula first and use \nthat to get an explicit formula (your first formula is an explicit one \nsince you only need the number of vertices in the polygon to get the number of diagonals in that polygon).  This is called ""solving the recursion.""  Sometimes a recursive formula is the best you can do because there simply is no explicit formula.\n\nI hope this helps."	Science & Mathematics

She needs to be thinking of your children right now, and focusing on their needs. Clearly if she bearly knows this guy, it is not appropriate for her to expose her children to him. The reason that they got molested, is because she didn't screen the guys she marries in the first place to make sure that hed be a fit parent or not, hence she married and had kids with a loser who is now behind bars. She needs to give her children more attention, since there is clearly a problem since it took her a while to find out about the molestation. I do think that she is trying to move on with her life too quickly, and should stop and take time to think whats the next best move for her and her children. Also the children would definately need therapy of some sort, and by moving on with her life she is indirectly telling them to move on with theirs and implying that what happened to them didn't matter. Her children might interpret this as neglect, and not feel that they are important to her, which could be a floodgate for future incidents or behaviour that they may be involved in. She should think of her childrens future and not just her own. Especially not while shes blinded by her latest love.	Family & Relationships

She has no right to answer or give an opinion since she was never part of a Greek organization, although she clearly seems jealous that she wasn't....\n\nGreek life is wonderful and it can really enhance your college life, as well as later in life. I've remained close to many of my ""sisters"" over the years. Putting my sorority on my resume even helped my land a job at a big company. I was told by HR that people who've been in Greek organizations have a higher likelihood of being successful in the workplace than those who weren't. I don't know if it's true, but it's worth considering. \n\nMy significant other was in a fraternity and is still close with all of his ""brothers"" as well. They still have get togethers a few times a year and help out with their chapter when needed.\n\nDo not think or let anyone ever tell you that being in a sorority is like buying friends. ALL organizations have dues...even my son's PTA organization. The cost pays for the parties and other supplies needed for get togethers and charity events. It's no different than paying for any other organization.\n\nAs for disadvantages, I suppose you might close yourself off to other organizations, as they do take up a lot of time.  Greek organizations are not just about partying, contrary to popular belief.  We partied hard, but we also participated in Adopt A Highway, Soup Kitchens, local elementary schools, donated money to a school for deaf children and helped to spread information about safe sex to high school and college freshmen students, just to name a few.\n\nHope this helps."

"Boy Trouble!!!!!!!!? .

Now recently he's started to tell me that he feels really comferable around me and feels like he's known me my whole life even though we only really knew eachother this year and that I'm like a sister to him. Theres only 1 problem I REALLY LIKE HIM A LOT! what should I do. And how can I get him to like me in more of a girlfriend kind of way? . I was in a similar situation with the guy that I'm with now, only we didn't go to the same school.  We were best of friends for a year and stuff then he started going out with my best friend.  They broke up and it was really hard on my best friend so I told her that I would never go out with him.  Yes, as foolish as it may seem, I had an amazing amount of feelings for him.  But I played along and said, ""Haha, yes, we're like brother and sister.""\n\nWell, long story short, we got past that [so I thought] and we started going out.  Then, he just randomly comes along one day and says ""It's akward because we used to be like brother and sister."" etc.  So, that ended, we were still friends and now we're ""together"" again, I suppose, though not exclusive.\n\nSee, boys are undecisive and it may take some time for them to realize their true feelings for you.  I think you are blessed to have such a good friend but, hon, you can't MAKE him like you.  Just be who you are, and that's what he loves you for, is being you.  Just give it time and maybe someday, he will like you in the way you like him.  If you really like him, you shouldn't tell him, so you don't make it akward between you two.  But, if the time comes along when you just can't take it and you NEED to tell him, do so.  But in the right way.  Just cherish what you have with him, because it's better than nothing."

"Do you think that being gay is a choice or something that you just feel when you are born? . Isn't it the same as being born a certain color or race and not having a say-so in it?  A gay friend told me that if he could be straight, he would only because he would not want the crap that comes with ""coming out"".  What do you think? . I insist that it is not something you're born into - but results from a bad family dynamic.  A withdrawn, aloof father who shows no affection, love, concern & closeness & bonding with his son will do this to him, as will a dominant , bossy, loud-mouth & demanding & assertive mother who ""wears the pants"" while the father sits meekly & looks on and farts his time away.   when the boy doesn't bond with his dad & identify with him as a male role model - no doubt the boy will turn out to be a homo.\n\nFor lesbians, it happens with a nasty father, showing no love & respect for her - as well as a cold, detached, uncaring mother who doesn't bond with her daughter - but ostracizes the girl.\n\nProblem is that all this happens AT A VERY TENDER AGE - and that's why people always suspect they're ""born"" that way or that the genes did it to them.  \n\nNO One - in their full sanity & rational mind, fully competent mentally - would ever CHOOOOOOOSE to be homo.  It's not like on a certain morning a guy gets up from sleep & decides - ""Well, I don't want girls, I want a guy to f-ck around with""  No -that's not what happens.  \n\nwhat happens is that viscerally, from within, the guy starts to feel physical & emotional attraction & need for a man's intimate presence - rather than for a female.   Parents bear the SOLE LIABILITY  for a lesbian daughter or a gay son.  \n\nthis has always been so - and is the undeniable truth !!!!!!!!!!!!"	Society & Culture

Is Arch Dams are the safest and strongest dams ? Is it have any problem in its saftey? .  . All dams have various levels of natural strength and safety. All types of dams have also suffered catastrophic failures.\nThe best example I can give you of a concrete dam failure is the St. Francis Dam in southern California, 1928. It was a concrete Gravity Arch dam about 200 feet high. It failed under a full reservior, due to the re-activation of an ancient landslide that composed the dam's left abutment. However, it's twin sister, the Hollywood (Mulholland) Dam, after retrofitting in the early 1930's, has stood strong to this day.\nEarthen dams have also failed, such as the Teton Dam in the 1970's.\nThe Van Norman Dam in the San Fernando Valley (rolled earth fill dam) collapsed during the 1971 Sylmar quake, but didn't fail. It held it's water long enough for emergency crews to lower the water level to a safe point, saving many lives and homes.\nThe biggest safety concerns for concrete dams are:\n1. Is the concrete of sufficient strength, with a well-cleaned aggregate?\n2. Is the foundation sound?\n3. What kind of siesmic activity can be expected in the area?\n4. Are there sufficient seepage galleries and grout curtains to control excess water and prevent piping?\n\nIf you're comparing concrete dam types, I'd say an arch dam is at least as safe as a concrete gravity dam (such as Shasta) provided it has firm rock to brace against.\n\nBasically, a dam is a wall that creates an entire lake behind it. Water is very heavy, and will always try to escape. So, as safe as they try to build them, that safety is always tenuous at best. \nCheck out my website on the St. Francis Dam, at...\nhttp://www.geocities.com/zeebya/integintro.html	Science & Mathematics

"does anybody know what this word means? . zoroastrianism. . Zoroastrianism was once the ""official"" religion of Sassanid (Sassanian) Persia, and played an important role in the Achaemenid as well as Parthian empires in Persia. The religion is also known as Mazdaism by some followers; and currently, as Zarathustrianism by others.\n\nZoroastrian areas once stretched from Anatolia to the Persian Gulf, and its followers once numbered in the millions. Its followers today, located in South Asia, Iran, and throughout the diaspora, number much less, but the religion is alive and dynamic.\n\nThe origin of the religion is ascribed to the prophet Zarathushtra, who is commonly known in the Western world as Zoroaster, the Greek version of his name. The etymology of his name is disputed and several different explanations exist. The modern Persian form of the prophet's name is Zartosht (Ø²Ø±ØªØ´Øª).\n\nZoroaster came to reform ancient Indo-Iranian religious practices (some of which were parallel to the Vedic religion of ancient India).\n\nAccording to different scholarly histories, Zoroaster lived in what was then ancient Persia. His dates are contested, but were clearly somewhere between the 18th and the 6th centuries BC (although Plato put Zoroaster in the 64th century BC). Zoroaster is thought to have written the Gathas, poems which have been assidiously preserved by his followers through centuries of oral transmission, before the whole of the Avesta (in which the Gathas are a central portion) were commited to writing in the Parthian or Sassanian periods. The Gathic dialect is similar to the Vedic Rig Veda and thus Zoroaster has sometimes been dated as roughly contemporary to the Rig Veda, normally ascribed to c.1500â1250 BC. However other sources suggest a later dateâin the 6th century BCE.\n\nThe faith is ostensibly monotheistic, although Zoroastrianism has a dualistic nature, with a series of six entities (similar in function and status to angels) accompanying Ahura Mazda (the Supreme Being), and forming a heptad that is good and constructive, and another group of seven who are evil and destructive. It is this persistent conflict between good and evil that distinguishes Zoroastrianism from monotheistic frameworks that have only one power as supreme. By requiring its adherents to have faith and belief in equally opposing powers Zoroastrianism characterizes itself as dualistic.\n\nZoroastrianism may also be known as Mazdayasna ""Worship of Wisdom"" by some its followers after the ancient name for God, Ahura Mazda, ""The ahura (divinity) Wisdom"". A modern Persian form is Behdin ""Good Religion/Law"" (see below for the role of daena Law). Zoroastrians may call themselves Zartoshti ""Zoroastrians"", Mazdayasni ""Wisdom-Worshippers"" and Behdini ""Followers of the Good Religion"", and even Zarathustrian."	Education & Reference

"what is the quickest way to lose weight, but with less effort? . im a college student, and i want to lose a few pounds. what is the quickest way to do this, with the least effort involved? . I love Dr Phil for one reason and here it is\n\nHe continually asks his guests one simple question: ""How's it working for you?""\n\nSuccess in anything comes from FINDING WHAT WORKS then DOING WHAT WORKS.\n\nI am going to reveal to you the Secret Weight Loss Formula that Celebrity personal trainer donât want you to know about.\n\nBefore I reveal the secret, first I need to explain to you that there is process that your body goes through to burn body fat. \n\nSo how does your body burn fat?\n\nThat process is the same for every human being. I will outline the steps and then show you how you can easily apply some fundamental rules to allow your body to burn the maximum amount of fat with less effort and minimum time. Once you understand that simple process, you can easily see why you are not getting the results that you want. Even bigger, you will finally see that getting that dream body is getting so much closer to reality that you will be extremely motivated to get started as soon as you can.\n\nHow does your body release the fat from the cells?\n\nBefore you can turn your body into a fat burning machine, here what needs to happen: your body fat need to be released from the fat cells. You can accomplish this step successfully with your nutrition program. Here are some specific tips that you can apply right away to achieve that.\n\n1.Eat 4-6 small, frequent meals and never skip meals.\n2.Include small amounts of good fats.\n3.Eat natural foods; avoid processed & refined foods\n4.Eat lean proteins with each meal.\n5.Eat more complex carbs, fruits & vegetables.\n\nThe most misunderstood weight loss strategy.\n\nReleasing fat from the fat cells is not the end of it; actually, it is just the beginning. Because the fat needs to be transported from the fat cells to your muscles so it can be burned there. This is done through your blood and the cardiovascular system is responsible for that. The more effective is that system, the more effective your body will become at burning fat. You can improve your cardio vascular system by doing so cardio training.  However, donât go out yet and spend 1 hour on the treadmill because you probably not going to be doing too much good like that.\n\nThe reason is excessive cardio combined with a restrictive diet burns fat but mostly muscle tissue. That is not a good thing at all, because muscle tissue is where you burn the fat and if you are burning away muscle tissue, you are burning your ability to burn more fat in the future (weight loss plateau). You just donât cut the hand that feed you. So cardio burns fat and it can also burn muscle tissue, this is a huge dilemma. Damn if you do, damn if you donât. But wait there is a solution to thatâ¦\n\nYou need to do some MODERATE cardio training. The key word here is moderate. \nDoing too much cardio can be detrimental and I am sure you have seen those people that are doing cardio on a daily basis and still not getting anywhere. The result is a low metabolism. Low metabolism means, your body fat is not going anywhere, anytime \nsoon. Here is what you need to do:\n\n1.Do some moderate cardio training; the key word here is moderate\n2.Never diet but consume little fewer calories that you will burn (No starvation diets, Please...)\n\nThe world most efficient âfat burnerâ available in the market is FREE and is already available to you.\n\nBefore I reveal to you how personal trainer get those celebrities in the best shape of their life in such short period there is one more thing that I want you to understand. Because it is very important. \nWeight loss marketers always claim that they have the magic âfat burnerâ that will melt your fat away. The problem is that they have a new one coming out every year, so I wonder if the one from last year was so effective, why we need a new one. There is only one thing that actually burn body fat is you already have it. It does not come in a bottle or a special recipe. Body fat can only be burned"	Health

What is the limit (calculus)? . these are in my calculus textbook and i can't figure them out\n\nlim        (sin(-2x)) / x\nx->0\n\nand \n\n\nlim        (sin(x+pi)) / x\nx->0 . If you are permitted to use L'hopital's rule, these are simple. Substituting, we find that both of these limits yield the indeterminate form 0/0, so we have:\n\n[xâ0]lim sin (-2x)/x = [xâ0]lim -2 cos (-2x)/1 = -2\n\n[xâ0]lim sin (x+Ï)/x = [xâ0] cos (x+Ï)/1 = -1\n\nIf you have to evaluate these without L'hopital (which I suspect, if you can't figure them out), then this is slightly harder, but still possible. Taking the first one:\n\n[xâ0]lim sin (-2x)/x\nUsing sin (-x)=-sin x:\n[xâ0]lim -sin (2x)/x\nApplying the double angle formula:\n[xâ0]lim -2sin x cos x/x\nRearranging:\n[xâ0]lim -2 cos x sin x/x\nWe know that [xâ0]lim sin x/x = 1 (this may be proven geometrically, without L'hopital, and in fact is an integral part of the proof that d(sin x)/dx = cos x). Thus, considering sin x/x as a single unit, this limit assumes the determinate form -2 * 1 * 1, so:\n[xâ0]lim sin (-2x)/x = -2\n\nFor the second:\n[xâ0]lim sin (x+Ï)/x\nUsing the angle addition formula:\n[xâ0]lim (sin x cos Ï + cos x sin Ï)/x\nSimplifying:\n[xâ0]lim -sin x/x\nAnd because [xâ0]lim sin x/x = 1:\n[xâ0]lim sin (x+Ï)/x = -1	Science & Mathematics

What are some Voir dire questions from both a prosecuting and defense attorney point of view? . I am doing a paper for my criminal justice class and we need to make voir dire  questions playing the role of both a prosecuting and defense attorney. I am lost, anyone have ideas? . Basically, the goal is to find a way to ask questions that will uncover those people who are likely to be on your side (either side). \n\nSome of these questions are designed to find potential jurors who would be biased against your case, or good for the other side, so that you can get them dismissed from the jury. Those are the most common, and they don't have to be too subtle.\n\nThe other type of questions are those which will reveal the jurors likely to believe your argument, but you need to do it in a way that doesn't reveal your strategy to the other side. This requires a lot of subtlety. It's usually just easier to accept anyone on the jury that you can't exclude.\n\nAs far as any particular situation, look for reasons of potential bias or prejudice. So, let's take a mugging case with three teenagers (first time offenders during spring break) as the defendants. \n\nThe defense might ask questions about who has ever been mugged, or felt threatened walking home at night, or was picked on during high school. These would indicate people likely to convict because they are afraid of being mugged themself. \n\nThe prosecution might ask questions about tolerance, mercy, people who have lived a little on the wild side themselves, people who are bullies, etc. This would indicate people likely to acquit because they either identify with the defendants, or because they believe everyone deserves a second chance.\n\nThe specific questions vary based on the fact pattern. But the goal is always to find out who among the jury pool would be bad for your case, for whatever reason, and get them dismissed.	Politics & Government

The toy is very simple to build, going together in minutes, and is very simple to understand and explain, and yet fascinating to watch and to use.  \n \n gauss rifle Click on image for animated view  \n \n The photo above shows six frames of video showing the gauss rifle in action. Each frame shows 1/30th of a second. In the first frame, a steel ball starts rolling towards a magnet taped to a wooden ruler. In the second frame, a second ball can be seen speeding between the rightmost two magnets. By the third frame, the accelerator has sped up so much that the ball that is seen leaving the left side of the device is just a blur as it smashes into the target. One ball, starting at rest, has caused another ball to leave the device at a very high speed.  \n \n gauss rifle materials Click on image for larger view  \n \n The materials are simple. We need a wooden ruler that has a groove in the top in which a steel ball can roll easily. Any piece of wood or aluminum or brass with a groove will work. We chose the ruler because they are easy to find around the house or at school or at a local stationery store.  \n \n We need some sticky tape. Again, almost any kind will do. Here we use Scotch brand transparent tape, but vinyl electrical tape works just as well.  \n \n We need four magnets. Most any type will do, but the stronger the magnets are, the faster the balls will go. Here we use the super strong gold-plated neodymium-iron-boron magnets we have made available in our catalog for the other projects. They work great.  \n \n We will also need nine steel balls, with a diameter that is a close match to the height of the magnets. We use 5/8 inch diameter nickel plated steel balls from our catalog.  \n \n The only tool we will need is a sharp knife for trimming the tape.  \n \n gauss rifle first\nClick on image for larger view  \n \n We start by taping the first magnet to the ruler at the 2.5 inch mark. The distance is somewhat arbitrary -- we wanted to get all four magnets on a one foot ruler. Feel free to experiment with the spacing later.  \n \n gauss rifle tape\nClick on image for larger view  \n \n With the sharp knife, trim off any excess tape. Be careful, since the knife will be strongly attracted to the magnet.  \n \n It is very important that you keep the magnets from jumping together. They are made of a brittle sintered material that shatters like a ceramic. Tape the ruler to the table temporarily, so that it doesn't jump up to the next magnet as you tape the second magnet to the ruler.  \n \n gauss rifle two\nClick on image for larger view  \n \n Continue taping the magnets to the ruler, leaving 2.5 inches between the magnets.  \n \n When all four magnets are taped to the ruler, it is time to load the gauss rifle with the balls.  \n \n gauss rifle all\nClick on image for larger view  \n \n To the right of each magnet, place two steel balls. Arrange a target to the right of the device, so the ball does not roll down the street and get lost.  \n \n To fire the gauss rifle, set a steel ball in the groove to the left of the leftmost magnet. Let the ball go. If it is close enough to the magnet, it will start rolling by itself, and hit the magnet.  \n \n gauss rifle ready\nClick on image for larger view  \n \n When the gauss rifle fires, it will happen too fast to see. The ball on the right will shoot away from the gun, and hit the target with considerable force. Our one foot long version is designed so the speed is not enough to hurt someone, and you can use your hand or foot as a target.	Science & Mathematics
America the melting pot? . Is Spanish or other language teaching in public schools helping or hindering the joining of others into our society? . Well, since unlike the immigrants who come here from countries such as Germany, Poland, Hungary, etc, Spanish people are not required to learn English (I guess we really are not created equal, since some groups of people can learn the language and others just are not smart enough)I guess it helps those of us born here, since we have to cater to them.

"Does anyone share in my theory that aliens are the gods in ancient mythology? .  . Yes I agree with you.  I have done extensive research into this theory and believe that it answers a lot of questions that no one else has been able to answer.  There are many books on the subject, Zechariah Sitchen is another author not already mentioned, that has written extensivly on the subject.\n\nMany believe that the gods in the ancient Sumerian writings were aliens.  These are also the oldest writings in history and most scholars agree that they are the root of most religions including Christianity, Judaism, and Islam.  Many of the scriptures in the OT bible can be traced back to the Sumerian texts that told of the same story, first.\n\nThere is the primitive tribe in Africa called the Dogon that have advanced knowledge of the solar system.  They have known for many years how many moons Jupiter had and about the rings of Saturn. They have knowledge of the Sirius B and C stars before science knew of them.  ""The Sirius Mystery"" is book written about this.  When it was originally printed in the 70's Sirius C had not yet been discovered by science.  It was discovered in the 90's and that more or less proves the Dogon correct.  How did they know this?  They insist that thousands of years ago men cam from the Orion galaxy and taught their ancestors.\n\nI am glad to see some other open minded individuals with opinions about this topic instead of the usual response from people that just want to shoot down theories because they have no knowledge of them and they don't agree with what they have always believed or been told but don't have the initiative to actually go out and research it and then make up their mind."

Anestigiologist...? . Hello, I've always wanted to be an anestigiologist...\n\nDoes anyone know how long i would go to school for, how much would I make, and what would i learn and take in college?\n\nIs there a certain type of name for this job..? . First if you haven't started undergraduate school, then you have a long ways to go.  You'll have to take a bunch of science classes including a year of biology, chemistry, organic chemistry, and physics; each for a year and with labs.  You'll also have to get good grades because there are tens of thousands of students every year going for a career in the health sciences.\n\nThen you'll have to take the Medical College Admissions Test (MCAT) which is like the SAT in that it is multiple choice, but it is in the subjects listed above and significantly more difficult.\n\nLook at medical school websites to see their admissions requirements and what the average GPA and MCAT of their students are.\n\nAfter getting into medical school, which is a feat in itself, you'll take the boards, USMLE, or the US Medical Licensing Examination.  That's another multiple choice test... it's 3 steps, but step one is probably the hardest test you'll ever take.  If you do poorly on that test, then kiss anethesiology goodbye as you'll probably do internal medicine or pediatrics.  Then you'll finish med school doing clinical rotations at hospitals.\n\nYou will have to study like a maniac and will probably want to kill yourself a couple of times a year.  Good luck, but if you really want to do it, you'll make it.  Also, I know it sounds really crazy and hard, but if you just take things one step at a time as they go, it is not that bad.... not great, but not impossible, like I said, tens of thousands do it every year.

Best Firewall for win xp pro? . I want to know which is the best or good Fire wall for my PC Running win Xp Pro. the windows fire wall i dont know much about.\nbut i had zone alarm before and when i talked to the microsoft they said that there fire wall is better then Zone alarm, i think he's just taking there side. . Zone Alarm is the best free firewall.  The only hard part about it is finding the free link on Zonelab's website.  I believe it to be better than Microsoft's firewall.  The reason being is you have more control over it.  Now Microsoft's One Care is the best software for the price.  Generally it is on sell somewhere for $29.99 and you can get a low price guarantee just about anywhere.  One Care is only good for broadband users, people with legal copies of Windows XP, and best bang for the buck can be installed on 3 PC's.  PC-Cillin Security Suite would be my alternative for people without broadband.  I just focused on the firewall aspect of these products and price.  I believe in not spending outrageous amounts of money on PC protection.  All PC protection is only 80% effective no matter what the software people may say.  I would try AVG Free Ant-Virus for viruses and they make an anti-spyware.	Computers & Internet

Cancer was invasive malignant ductal carcinoma. want to share some advise to those who's doc tell them to wait. Please don't wait for anything.  If I had waited like they asked, 6 mo.

Am going to Dana Farber in Boston for possible chemo treatments.  Don't know about that decision yet.  God bless you . With any occupation, incompetence exist! That is why everyone stresses get second and third opinions! I would report that doctor to your states medical board for investigation! You might save someone else's life! My wife's parents both died from cancer and in my opinion it was the doctor who treated them! As we all know, money is the driving force behind everything in America. Moral values went out the window many moons ago! So, it is in the medical communities best interest to drag you through the quagmire of brutal treatment so they can capitalize on your pain and suffering! Let's face the facts, if they gave us the cure (which they do have) doctors would lose surgery and treatment fees, hospitals would lose all those chemo treatment cost, surgical fees, etc, pharmaceutical companies would loose all those prescription drug incomes and so on! The whole thing boils down to how much people are making! \nWish you the best of luck for a full recovery and a long life!	Health
Why would you marry a woman if you're gay? . I am not against homosexuality. The lives of many women and children are destroyed when a man decides to come out of the closet after marrying and creating a family. I know of two very close friends of mine who had nervous breakdowns, after discovering their husbands were gay. It is a deep, hurtful betrayal that no woman would find easy to forgive. Her whole world is shattered, because it is a painful realization that your husband can't love you the way you thought he did.\n\nWhy be a selfish coward and hurt people this way? Why not stay single or if you're going to get married to a woman, why not tell her the truth before hand, so that at least she knows what to expect?\n\nI ask please that no one gives any gay bashing comments or that it's a sin comment. . Long answer, One I am very qualified to answer. I am a 39 year old gay man that came out only 7 short years ago. I did this by telling my wife I was gay and I wanted a divorce. \n\nNow, I am ashamed of what I did to my ex-wife and best friend. We have worked through the issue over time and we are still best friends. She knows I loved here and cared for here when we were married, but also now that we are just friends. She places no blame upon me. She blames society and their lack of ability to accept people for who they are.\n\nWhen I married my ex-wife I was 26 and the year was 1992. I was an active duty military office. I came from a Lutheran background with a father who hated gays. I had every reason to do what society expected of me to do. Get married. I honestly thought I could fight off the feelings of being gay. Besides back then to even mention the word gay instantly conjured up that I was an AIDS carrying, child abusing abomination. If I had been true to myself I would have faced a horrific life of gay bashing. Getting fired from good jobs because I was gay and any number of other persecutions. I lied to myself and her.\n\nThe marriage worked in the beginning, but the sex soon stopped (or close to it). I simply didn't like it, but I did try to fulfill my duties. I stayed faithful to her through out the marriage and never cheated. However, as time has evolved so have the feelings toward gays. When I came out in 1999 being gay was chic then. Everyone knew one, had to have them over to parties, and finally realized we were not the deviants they thought we were. Logic and love finally had taken over in the world.\n\nSo, now you have heard some of my life story. So you ask why do we do this? Pressure placed upon us by society. From peers in school and college. Military service, jobs, Churches, families and friends. All of these who still don't accept us. Many still today have one or several of these reasons to hide. Only when we feel safe, and only after years of fighting with ourselves do we come out and destroy our marriages. We do what is expected and pressured to do, plain and simple. BTW for the record women do this too.\n\nSo don't blame the man/woman. Blame those out there placing these pressures upon us to hide who we really are. Blame those placing the pressures upon us to marry so we can have grandchildren or advance our careers. We are not cowards. We are victims.\n\nTo you I say you should find out his side of the story. What caused your friends husband to hide who he was, and pressure him into the marriage? Learn the other side of the story. Then help your friend realize he did love her, and by setting her free both can now go on and find another one to love again. Help their children love both of them and accept them. Stop the pressure that caused this lie to start. Stop judging, and learn and accept. Only then can the pressures other cause us stop. For we are all loved by God, and we all should love and accept each other.	Society & Culture

Hey girl My husband just got back from a year long deployment but he was gone for a total of a year and a half. I was pregnant with our first child and it was hard! Here are some tips that helped keep us together:\n\nWrite a journal between the two of you. You write in it for a couple days and tell him EVERYTHING that happens then send it to him and ask him to do the same.\n\nDon't freak out if he doesn't call you. Remember no news is good news. If something happens to him they will know and will contact his family who will contact you.\n\nTell him everything when he calls, big stuff first and then the little stuff. All they want to hear about is something outside of the war. If he starts talking about it, listen. He probably needs to get it off his chest. \n\nCommunication is key! Write him letters every once in awhile. Let him know you always think of him. Send him cards when you see a cute one in the store, there doesnt need to be a reason. Send care packages just to let him know you care. Send something for each and every holiday no matter how small.\n\nYou will be ok. Get involved with his FRG she will have all the updates you will need and there will be other wives and families and gf/bf's that are going through the same thing you are.\n\nMy husbands unit only lost 15 people out of thousands. They are taking many measure to provide ultimate safty. Don't worry too much just be there for him and keep him in your prayers. If you need to talk and you don't have anyone there to talk to contact me. I am a soldier my self so I may be able to answer some ?'s.	Politics & Government

Also if she smiles when she isn't smiling then she likes you, and if it is a big smile then she totally likes you but if it is a nice friendly hello smile then she is just trying to be nice.

Anybody who tries to give you exact percentages for highly-variable phenomenon is most likely engaging in pseudoscience!\n\nHowever, a big portion of communication - especially unfilterted/honest communication - is transmitted through body language; the facial muscles are different for a fake smile vs. real smile etc.  This is not enough to overcome cultural barriers - although it helps in determining if someone from another culture is experiencing some type of emotions (angry/sad/happy etc).

I need help from men who were molested as children. Problem with my boyfriend? . I have been with my boyfriend for about 5 and a half months. When we first got together he was very interested in sex and aggressive about it. After a month or two his interest wained. I almost always have to initiate it and he says no about 70 percent of the time. I am pretty sure he isn't sleeping with anyone else because he's with me almost all of his free time. He practically lives here. He told me he was molested as a child by his mother's boyfriend. I am wondering if this could have to do with his difficulty in being more sexual as we get closer. It seemed to start when we got more emotionally involved. Everything else in the relationship is good and we are rather close. He assures me he finds me attractive. I've tried to get an explanation out of him and all he has said is that this happens with every girl he's with for awhile. HELP! I'm going nuts here! . as strange as this is for you i feel your confusion.i was molested at age 11 and i am 36 now - i am just now getting counseling for it. my counselor says that i have been blaming my self for it as if it was my fault.\nyour boy friend has some problems only he can work out.\nbut the sex things are probably hard for him because he might be having flash backs of remembering that hurtful time of his abuse. it has nothing to do with u you are not the problem the pain of the past may be causing this difficulty - be patient with him and tell him you understand and will be supportive of him, love never fails.

To do this you find the first derivative:\nf'(x) = 3x^2 -8x + 3\nWhen f'(x) = 0 there is a miinimum or maximum.\nWhere is this one increasing to a max and/or min?  Set it equal to 0,\n3x^2 -8x + 3 = 0; apply the quadratic formula to find the 0's for x:\n\nx = {-(-8) +- sqr[(-8)^2 - 4(3)(3)]}/2(3)\n   = {8 +- sqr[64-36]}/2 = {8 +- sqr[28]}/2 = {8 +- 2sqr(7)}/6\n   = (4+-sqr(7))/3 = x1, x2\n\nNow you have two values of x; now look at f(x) in the interval\n(-infinity, x1), then (x1,x2), then (x2,+infinity); this will tell you the answer.  Make a table showing the values approaching x1, \nx1 to x2, then x2 on.  And there you have it.	Science & Mathematics

value of japanese invasion currency? .  . Banana money. No value.\n\nWhy is called banana money?\n\nBanana money is an informal term given to a type of currency issued by Imperial Japan during the Japanese Occupation of Singapore, and was named as such because of the motifs of banana trees on the banknotes. It was in widespread use within the occupied territories where the previous currency became a scarcity. To supply the authorities with money whenever they required it, they simply printed more notes. This resulted in high inflation and a severe depreciation in value of the banana note. Moreover, counterfeiting was rampant due to its lack of a serial number.\n\nAs with other currencies issued by Japan in occupied territories, local residents were forced to adopt this type of currency. After the surrender of Japan, the currency became entirely worthless, and to this day the Japanese government has refused to exchange these currencies. Some locals managed to escape poverty because they had hidden Straits dollars, the previous currency before the Japanese invaded. Those with hidden stashes of Straits Dollar were thus able to use them the moment the British resumed control of Singapore, when they became valid again.	Business & Finance

Tax implications of being given a house? . I'm thinking of buying a house, leasing it to my in-laws, then once the mortgage is paid off, giving it to them and transferring the title.  Would they have to pay income tax on the value of the house? . I believe the current laws are that you can give someone $11,000 tax free. So if you and your wife both gave it would be $22,000. But, if you put their name on as the co-purchaser while the mortgage is being paid off, you wouldn't run into this issue.\n\nI just did something similar for one of my children.	Business & Finance

Credit people please help..Credit Question? . Im 23 and im rebuilding my credit. I settled 1 account on my credit report and paid one off in full. Now i have to build up again. I got a $250.00 credit card. My question is....Is it better to pay it off in full everymonth or leave a small balance? no one can seem to give me the right answer......i only charge maybe 50 bucks a month. I need my score to go back up. thanks :) . To rebuild your credit you should leave a small balance and pay on it every month on time. What they are looking for is a history of payments to show that if they loan you money on something that you cant pay in full like a house or a car, that you will make the payment every month on time. You also have a right to put an explanation on your credit report for the accounts that were pass due, something like job loss, illness, divorce that will explain why you got behind on those accounts. To do that go to your local credit bureau offices (you need to go to all 3 since they do not share info).	Business & Finance

"any opinions on this article about stress do u agree with it. what do you think about it? . As we remember our cultural differences, let us also remember our similarities. One of these is stress. As humans, when we become stressed, the ""fight or flight"" response kicks in. The adrenaline rush that wreaks havoc with our autonomic nervous system causes a host of annoying symptoms: sweaty palms, pounding heart, ""butterflies"" in the stomach, skin-tingling sensations, a slight fuzzy headedness or mild disorientation, tightness in various muscles, and other common signs of stress. Unrelieved or prolonged stress can initiate or aggravate various diseases or conditions. In other words, stress is universal to the human condition, and too much of it is not a good thing. \n\nSome causes of stress and the ways people have found to relieve stress may differ across cultures. For example, people in Western cultures tend to be time bound. The clock is a central part of their lives, and punctuality is a desired trait to be cultivated. Lateness, at best, betrays a lack of organization. At worst, the latecomer reveals a lack of consideration for others' time. A person who shows up late for an appointment is sure to cause stress in those who are left waiting. In some Latin cultures, however, time is no big deal. For example, a ten o'clock appointment in real time may mean anytime before noon. People in these cultures may feel stressed by others who insist that ten o'clock means ten o'clock. \n\nPeople relieve stress in different ways. Relaxation techniques, meditation, and massage therapies are common to many cultures although their specific practices and methods may differ. Some of the best stress relievers are those that individuals come up with based on a consideration of their preferences and needs. For example, some find relief in a favorite hobby or activity. For some, a workout at the gym relaxes them. For still others, reading is a favorite escape from the day's cares. \n\nStress can be the result of poor organization or inadequate preparation. For example, students who put off studying until the night before a test or who put off writing a research paper until the week before it is due are almost certain to experience stress and perhaps even failure, which will result in more stress. Although this kind of stress can be prevented, some stress is natural to certain events and circumstances and must be dealt with as it arises. Following is a list of common stressors that may affect people in many cultures: \n\nPersonal injury    Death of a pet \nDeath of spouse or family member    Increase in rent or other payments \nSerious illness   Traffic or road conditions \nBeing downsized or fired from a job   Change in government \nCareer change   Promotion at work \nMoving to a new city, state, or country    Losing a friend \nDivorce    Debt \nArgument with spouse   Lack of sleep \nLoss of income   Change in eating habits \nDamage to home or vehicle    Having to learn a new skill \n\nWhat causes stress in your life? What can you do to prevent stress in those situations over which you have control? What ways have you found to cope with the stress that results from unexpected events? . What causes stress?\n\n1.  Illness of aging parents and in-laws\n2.  Rearing a pre-teen\n3.  Keeping up with housekeeping while working full-time\n\nWhat can I do?\n\n1.  Encourage them to get regular check-ups and get treatment for on-going medical problems\n2.  I'm open for suggestions on this one - all I can do is love and encourage him thru the lows and celebrate with him during the highs!\n3.  Realize that in all actuality, my house is probably cleaner than most stay-at-home Mom's, and as long as the kitchen and bathrooms are relatively germ-free - we're okay!\n\nCoping?\nPlain and simple - I pray!  I know beyond a shadow of a doubt that since God created me, He knows what's going on in my life and exactly how I'm feeling.  He even promised in His word that He wouldn't put more on us that we can bear!  He is my source of Joy and Peace and I couldn't make it through a day without Him - God bless!!!"	Health

How do I download a program off of my hard drive to a usb driver to transfer to another computer? . I bought a new computer and I want to transfer 3 programs that I need to save. I bought a USB Flash drive to transfer to and it came with no instructions. . The previous answers assume there are no DLLs / program components saved outside the default program install folder, and there are no registry keys needed for the software, and that the software does not use a dongle to prevent unauthorized copying.\n\nThe short answer is, depending on the program, it may suffice to simply copy the .exe file, or program folder, to your drive, then move it to another computer.\n\nHowever, most programs require certain registry entries in order to work; others require certain libraries to exist on the computer, which may not be located in the program folder itself; and others configure themselves to your computer specifically, using a hardware component (dongle) to run.\n\nAlso, it violates most software licenses to operate the same program with the same registration number on two computers.\n\nIf you are trying to transfer a program from your old PC to a new Windows PC, you can use the files and settings transfer wizard, possibly, to move the program.\n\nThere are also commercial PC transfer programs that will do a better job of moving software than the file and settings wizard.\n\nIn short, your thumb drive idea probably isn't going to work, and even if you can get it to work, you're probably violating the software's license.

"Did Dianne Carroll have children? Were any of them adopted, or relinquished.? .  . She had 6 children.  Read below:  \n\nHorsehair rebuilt after summer bushfires \nReporter: Tim Lee\nFirst Published: 25/5/2003 \nThe recent summer bushfires killed vast tracts of bush throughout the forests of southern Australia. Now, four months later, green shoots fringe the blackened trees and spring from the ashes as the bush regenerates. \n\nHowever the fires permanently destroyed some priceless man-made landmarks. More than one hundred mountain huts were razed by fire, among them the heritage-listed 'Horsehair' hut.\n\n'Horsehair' had been Victoria's oldest surviving alpine hut. Though scarcely had the ashes cooled, plans were already underway to re-build it. \n\nBut many of the other huts may never be re-built. Many public land managers argue such huts do not belong in the high country.\n\nIn 1872, the sound of cross cut saws and broadaxes echoed across Mount Hotham. A group of Cattlemen, hauled logs, split shingles and built a mountain refuge. For as long as cattle have run in the High Country, there have been huts for the stockmen. These rustic buildings afforded some comfort when the day's mustering was done. When blizzards raged and the snow flew fierce and blanketed the landscape, they saved many a life.\n\nBut this summer, nature's fury came in another form. The worst bushfires in 60 years tore through the High Country. \n\n""Three months ago on the 26th of January, a wild fire came through here, and I don't think any of us here can probably imagine what that was like, but that wildfire took out the oldest Cattlemen's Hut on the High Plains, still existing, Horsehair Hut,"" Fiona Magnuson said. \n\nThroughout the Southern Alps, in the Kosciuszko region of New South Wales and in the High Country of North-East Victoria, bushfires swept across more than one million hectares. They killed vast tracts of forest, numerous wildlife and more than one hundred alpine huts in the two states. \n\n""I estimate 53 in total have been lost in Victoria, that number will probably grow when we get access to some of the more isolated areas, it'll probably reach close to sixty by the end of the period,"" Robin Rishworth said. \n\nEven before the fires had been extinguished, plans were underway to re-build some of what was lost. Dianne Carroll's high country heritage compelled her to action. An historian, author and mother of six, Carroll soon found willing support from near and far. So, three months later, phone calls and e-mails have mustered many to the cause. The crack is heritage skills exponent Graeme Fall. \n\n""Squaring off beams and the sides of the beams for the logs to fit together in the walls of the building and I'm going to be doing a mantelpiece shortly, split a piece of wood out of a log and then take one side off and make a smooth side on the top of the mantelpiece,"" Graeme Fall said. \n\n""Our huts, especially the older ones are our only visual link to the past and our pioneers and each one we lose it's another chapter of our history, although re-building it's not the same as the original, it's going to keep the history of the original going,"" Dianne Carroll said.\n\nThe original hut stood on freehold land close to here. But an airport recently built to serve the nearby snowfields had intruded on its outlook. So a new site has been chosen. But some parts of the old hut have been salvaged. The giant logs, killed by the bushfire, were milled nearby. The new Horsehair Hut will be true to the original. \n\nFrom Melbourne the Range Rover Club has arrived and from over the range North East Mason's Response Unit. Dianne Carroll's public plea for second-hand building materials has produced some useful timbers, for next to nothing. \n\n""I think we're up to $37. Yeah. It's all been donated time, material, and I'm still in disbelief. I think today's the first day it's hit me and the more the hut looks lik"	Family & Relationships
Do you think it is fascism to forbid talking other languages except home language? . In Holland it is wanted to be forbidden to talk other languages except Dutch. In Germany two people who talk in Turkish have been kicked out from a gym center. Don't you think these are fascist applications? . I think it is a little extreme, but I can understand the frustration.  Here in Texas, I get annoyed when people of Hispanic origin refuse to learn English, and our society and government enables them to do this by not requiring immigrants to learn english, and even forcing government employees to speak spanish.  Also, our local and national businesses learn spanish to accomodate those who do not speak our language.\n\nI am all for immigration....that is what the makes the U.S. An intresting place to live, but I doubt that if I moved to Mexico or Spain or any other spanish speaking country, that they would learn english to accomadate me.  I understand why they would not....pride in their culture...we have the same and would appreciate immigrants having enough respect to learn it.  After all, it is free from our government.  \n\nSo, I guess my final thought on your question is that I agree that it is a little extreme to forbid it, but at the same time, I see why and understand the reason.\n\nTake care and God bless.

Wedding dress cost - how much is too much? . Are there any rule of thumbs?\nHow much of total budget (%)?\nOr dollar amount for middle class? .

Some dresses go up into the 10s of thousands and some middle class families are willing to spend that amount on those dresses.\nWhat are you willing to shell out?

How do you separate the gases in the air? . Like oxygen, helium, and carbon dioxide. . First step\nKnow the properties of gases\nCarbon dioxide will turn into a solid while cooling air, so it should be removed. \nAll remaining gases will become liquid when they are cooled. \n\nStep 2\nThe only step to separate gases in the air is to cool them. There are  2 principal ways: By reducing the pressure from standard pressure to lower presure values. OR by decreasing temperature. \n\nMETHOD: Fractional distillation of air should be used. It involves pumping air into a container, after having removed carbon dioxide from it. \n\nCarbon dioxide, being an acidic gas, is removed by passing air through an alkali by bubbling the air through the alkali. \n\nThe air rid of carbon dioxide is then passed through a special and sealed container, where the pressure will be reduced for the gas components to appear as a liquid. On the basis of recorded boiling points of gases, each gas is collected in turn. \n\nCONCLUSION:Thus you have separated the gas mixtures from air. You can use them to propel rockets.

"what emotional effects does losing a parent have teenagers? . its research . I technically lost my father when I was 17.  He did not die but due to a major accident he does have such severe brain damage he has the mental capacity of a 5 year old.  He can more or less operate, but has no idea who I am and is prone to severe tempertantrums, seizures, and fits of throwing up.  He has to eat through a tube in his stomach because the accident paralyzed most of his face and throat.\n\nI know for me, it was hard to see him there and know it really wasn't him.  I wanted to be angry at him, but the man I wanted to be angry with was little more than a shell of the one who had raised me.  I wanted to cry, but my dad had always been the one to give me a shoulder.  When I tried to touch him he yelled at me because I had taken away his book earlier.  I was the bad guy at the moment.  It was a complete role reversal that I almost couldn't handle.  I felt wierd having to discipline my own father for back talking me when I told him to hold still so I could change his feeding tube out.  In essence my dad was dead and all that was left was a child to be taken care of.\n\nI cried often then, and could not talk about it.  When asked I changed the subject or simply remained quiet.  I'm 21 now and my dad currently lives in FL with his mom.  I don't have to take care of him anymore, but it was still hard to, after having been a daddy's girl all my life, walk down the aisle on my wedding day alone, because my daddy didn't know he even had a daughter anymore.  And I dreaded it since I was 17, knowing that all the things promised me by society had been stripped away, leaving me to improvise. Things like being walked down the aisle.  Snapping picture after annoying picture at my high school graduation.  Helping me move into the dorms at college and giving every male on campus the ""touch her and die"" look. Spoiling my children (which we've yet to have) and sending them home hyped on sugar.  I missed and will miss out on those things and I knew it from the time of my dad's accident.  It was hard, in a little way, to deal with those events without my dad there, as I'd always imagined, and perhaps taken for granted that he would be.  \n\nAt the time of my dad's accident it was simply something to take care of.  It wasn't until everything WAS taken care of that the things I had really lost set in, and began to hurt."	Education & Reference

fatty liver degeneration? . what is fatty liver degeneration .What are its causes .How it affacts human health .What is its remeady . Here is a bunch of information for you- D\nFatty liver is an excessive accumulation of a type of fat (triglyceride) inside the liver cells. \nIn the United States and other Western countries, the most common causes of fatty liver are alcoholism, obesity, diabetes, and elevated serum triglyceride levels. Other causes include malnutrition, hereditary disorders of metabolism (such as the glycogen storage diseases (see Muscular Dystrophy and Related Disorders: Introduction and Hereditary Metabolic Disorders: Glycogen Storage Diseases), and drugs (such as corticosteroids, tetracyclineSome Trade Names \nACHROMYCIN V\nTETRACYN\nSUMYCIN\n, and aspirinSome Trade Names \nECOTRIN\nASPERGUM\n). The mechanism by which these diseases or factors cause fat to accumulate within liver cells is not known. Simply eating a high-fat diet, for example, does not produce a fatty liver. One possible explanation is that these diseases or factors slow the rate at which fat is processed (metabolized) and excreted by the body. The resulting buildup of fat within the body, according to this theory, is then stored inside the liver cells.\n\nSometimes the cause of fatty liver is not clear, especially when it occurs in newborns; however, it is likely to be a defect in the mitochondria of the liver cells.\n\nIn some people, a fatty liver not due to alcohol abuse or drugs and toxins but associated with obesity, diabetes mellitus, and raised serum triglycerides will progress to scarring (fibrosis) and cirrhosis, possibly because of underlying inflammation. This type of fatty liver is sometimes referred to as nonalcoholic steatohepatitis.\n  \nKnown Causes of Fatty Liver \n\nObesity \nDiabetes \nChemicals and drugs (such as alcohol, corticosteroids, tetracyclines, valproate, methotrexate, carbon tetrachloride, and yellow phosphorus) \nMalnutrition and a low-protein diet \nPregnancy \nVitamin A toxicity \nBypass surgery of the small intestine \nCystic fibrosis (most likely accompanied by malnutrition) \nHereditary defects in glycogen, galactose, tyrosine, or homocystine metabolism \nMedium-chain aryl dehydrogenase deficiency \nCholesterol esterase deficiency \nPhytanic acid storage disease (Refsum's disease) \nAbetalipoproteinemia \nReye's syndrome \n\nSymptoms and Diagnosis\n\nFatty liver usually produces no symptoms. In rare cases, however, it results in jaundice (a yellowish discoloration of the skin and the whites of the eyes), nausea, vomiting, pain, and abdominal tenderness.\n\nA physical examination that reveals an enlarged liver without any other symptoms suggests fatty liver. Liver function tests are also performed to determine if there is a liver abnormality, such as inflammation (see Liver Function Tests), which sometimes accompanies the extra fat in the liver cells and can be associated with the development of cirrhosis in nonalcoholic steatohepatitis. Excess fat in the liver can be detected on abdominal ultrasound. The diagnosis may be confirmed by a liver biopsy, in which a doctor inserts a long hollow needle through the skin to obtain a small piece of liver tissue for examination under a microscope (see Diagnostic Tests for Liver and Gallbladder Disorders: Biopsy of the Liver).\n\nPrognosis and Treatment\n\nAlthough excessive fat in the liver may not in itself be a serious problem (the fat can disappear, for example, if the person stops drinking), its underlying cause might be. For example, repeated liver injury from toxic substances such as alcohol may eventually progress from fatty liver to cirrhosis (severe scarring of the liver). Therefore, treatment of fatty liver aims at minimizing or eliminating the underlying cause of the disorder.\n\nLast reviewed/revised February 1, 2003\n  \n  \n Liver Degenerative Disease\n\nWhen compared to other health conditions, it is striking how little attention is given to diseases of the liver, particularly considering the rising level of concern about health and health-related environmental issues.

whats the possibility of turning out pregnant if you had sex for the first time but used no protection? .  . It depends on a lot of things..where you are in your menstrual cycle, for example. The chances of someone getting pregnant within an entire year of unprotected sex is 84%.\n\nIf it's been within five days of unprotected sex, then you can take emergency contraception, or Plan B. It's 75-89% effective against pregnancy and it has VERY few side effects (the main ones being some people get nauseous and some people have their next period early, and it might be lighter or heavier than usual.) It's a very safe medication as well.\n\nTo find places near you that carry emergency contraception, go to www.not-2-late.com.\n\n\nIf the incident was over 5 days ago, then it takes two weeks from an act of unprotected sex for a pregnancy test to come out positive (if you got pregnant from that incident.)

"I think I may be gay... how do you know what is normal and what is not? . I don't think being gay is contagious in any way, but I was hanging out with some gay friends... and though I didn't have feelings for them, think I like girls more than guys... I am scared of men, due to being raped and a victim of incest. I used to be super promiscuious, but I never felt anything. I thought it was because I was numbing out but maybe it was because i just don't have feelings for guys. Any insight? . How to tell if you're gay: \n1. If you are over 30 and you have a washboard stomach, you are gay. It means you haven't sucked back enough beer with the boys and rather you've been sucking-off the boys and have spent the rest of your free time doing sit-ups, aerobics, and doing the Oprah diet. \n\n\n\n2. If you have a cat, you are a Flaaaayming gay. A cat is like a dog, but gay: it grooms itself constantly but never scratches itself, has a delicate touch except when it uses its nails, and whines to be fed. And just think about how you call a dog...""Killer, come here! I said get your butt over here!"" Now think about how you call a cat... ""Bun-bun, come to daddy, snookums!"" Jeeezus, you're fit to be framed, you're so gay. \n\n\n\n3. If you suck on lolipops, Ring-Pops, baby-pacifiers, or any such nonsense, rest assured, you are a Gaylord. A straight man only sucks bar-b-q ribs, crab-claws, raw oysters, craw-fish guts, pickled pigs feet, or titties. Anything else and you are in training to suck El Dicko and undeniably gay. \n\n\n\n4. If you refuse to take a dump in a public bathroom or piss in a parking lot, you're in a deep homosexual relationship. A man's world is his bathroom, he defecates and urinates where he pleases.\n\n\n5. If you drink decaf coffee with skim milk, you like a high hard one in the poop-chute. Coffee is to be had strong, black (or with thick, wholesome milk) and full-aroma. A vagina-eating man will never be heard ordering a ""Decaf Cafe Latte with Skim"" and he will never, ever know what artificial sweetner tastes like. If you've had Nutrasweet in your mouth, you've had a dick there too. \n\n\n\n6. If you know more than six names of colors or four different types of dessert, you might as well be handing out free passes to your bung. A real man doesn't have memory space in his brain to remember all of that crap as well as all the names of all the players in the Major league, NFL, NBA, college ball, PGA, and Nascar. If you can pick out chartreusse or you know what a ""fresier"" is you're gay. And if you can name ANY type of textile other than denim, you are faggadocious! \n\n\n\n7. If you drive with both hands on the wheel, forget it...you hungry for meat-popsicle. A man only puts both hands on the wheel to honk at a slow driver or to cut the dude off. The rest of the time he needs that hand to change the radio station, eat his hamburger, hold his beer, finger the bi-atch in the passenger seat (whoever she happens to be), or, if he's Latino, talk on his cell-phone. \n\n\n\n8. If you enjoy romantic comedies or French films, mon-frere, vous sonnez le Gay, oui? The only time it is acceptable to watch one of those is with a woman who knows how to reward her man. Watching any of the above films by yourself or with another man is likely to result in SHC (spontaneous homosexual combustion), which is what happens to fags when they flame out too quickly."

Is it better to move up the property ladder or pay off extra on your existing mortgage? . I have a one bedroom maisonette and find that I'm getting on okay. When I get married there will be two of us here with double the salary. \n\nIs it better to move somehwere larger and get a larger mortgage\n\nOr is it better to pay extra on this mortgage and try and clear some of it quickly before moving on? . I can tell you as a Long Term Single Parent, that it is FAR BETTER and was FAR BETTER for me to pay off and pay down the existing mortgage on the home I purchased rather than move on up to another property -- because ... I kept this home through out all the years I was on Active Duty, rented it out, and when I finally secured my Military Retirement -- NOW .. the home was within a few payments of being paid off in full - a REAL BLESSING considering that I had two young children to raise and DID Raise them to adulthood in the home.\n\nFAR, FAR better to repurpose your space, or if you can -- to build on and/or remodel to obtain additional room -- and that is ONLY of you have the existing property space to do so.  \n\nIF NOT -- paying down the mortgage faster allows you to not just gain greater equity in your existing property, but also to have that as a Leverage in when you DO need to either move on up or remodel.

I'd guess in the late 60's early 70's.  \n\nIn essence, the point was that the world was running out of food.  People who had outlived their usefulness were encouraged to remove themselves from the poulation in very comfortable and pretty suicide centers (I forget what they called them).  \n\nIn addition to that food was strictly rationed, and very very processed.  There were two types of foods.  Soilent Orange and Soilent Green.  Everyone loved soilent green, it was tastier, but there was a horrible state secret.......  it was people....  from those suicide centers.  \n\nDefinitely a nightmare scenario, but thankfully, with genetic engineering and plant sciences, we have overcome that food problem, and are all going to die out from complications of global warming or nuclear war rather than this particular overpopulation scenario.  I guess we could starve, but state sponsored cannibalism is probably not on the menu.  Then again, I never thought the US would go for  GITMO or the NSA domestically spying, either."

Please solve showing work? . For 1989 and 1990 DaVE johnson had the highest decathlon score in the world.When Johnson reached a speed of 32 ft/sec on the pole cault runway, hs hieght above ground t seconds after leaving the ground was given by h=-162^2+32t. For how long was he more than 14 ft in the air? \nPlease show your work . I think your equation should say âh = -16t^2 + 32tâ - the â-162^2â part doesnât make sense.  He goes up and down following a parabola, so there has to be a t^2 term somewhere for this equation to work.\n\nIâm going to assume that it should be -16t^2 and go from there.  To find the point where he gets to 14 feet, simply set the equation to 14:\n\nh = -16t^2 + 32t\n14 = -16t^2 + 32t\n0 = -16t^2 + 32t â 14\n0 = 8t^2 - 16t + 7\nt = [16 +/- sqrt((-16)^2 - 4(8)(7))] / 2(8)\nt = [16 +/- sqrt(256 - 224)] / 16\nt = [16 +/- sqrt(32)] / 16\nt = 1 +/- sqrt(2)/4\nt = 0.65s, 1.35s\n\nSo at 0.65s and 1.35s, he was at 14 feet.  Subtract the two and you find that he was at or above 14 feet for 0.7s.  (For a precise time, you can subtract [1 + sqrt(2)/4] - [1 - sqrt(2)/4] and get sqrt(2)/2.)	Education & Reference

How can a nurse ascertain a alcoholic is telling the truth? .  . There is no absolute way to ascertain if anybody is telling you the truth. You have to go with your gut feeling. Always accept what the patient is telling you without judgement. You will not only be using your questions and answers for your assessment, but also your assessment skills of appearance, labs, auscultation, and treatment for withdrawls. You will need to look at the whole picture. This will tell you if the patient is telling you the truth.\nSometimes it is helpful to talk to other nurses who have treated the patient before. They have a good grasp on what the patient has been through and should be able to give you some helpful info.	Education & Reference
What is the solution to this somewhat challenging mathematical riddle? . Two truth-telling mathematicians--called Alejandra and Baltasar--ride in a bus.  The following conversation is overheard:\n\nA: The product of the ages of my kids is my own age, and the sum of their ages is the number of this bus.\n\nB: Hm.  Perhaps if you told me what your age is and how many children you have, I could logically infer the ages of your kids?\n\nA: No, I'm afraid that wouldn't be possible.\n\nB: Now I know your age.\n\nAssume that the ages of Alejandra's kids are all integer numbers (and that, of course, Alejandra has at least one kid).  \n\nQuestion: What was the number of the bus? . Letâs call a positive integer ambiguous if there are two different partitions of equal\nsize of it into summands whose products are the same. For example, 14 is ambiguous because\n14 = 3+3+8 = 2+6+6 and 3 Â· 3 Â· 8 = 2 Â· 6 Â· 6 = 72. A number is called doubly ambiguous if\nthere are two pairs of partitions each of which has the same product, and these two products\nare different. For example, 13 is doubly ambiguous since 13 = 1 + 6 + 6 = 2 + 2 + 9 and\n1 Â· 6 Â· 6 = 2 Â· 2 Â· 9 = 36 and at the same time 13 = 1 + 1 + 3 + 4 + 4 = 1 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 6 and\n1 Â· 1 Â· 3 Â· 4 Â· 4 = 1 Â· 2 Â· 2 Â· 2 Â· 6 = 48. Now the first mathematicians response to the second mathematicianss\ncomment is equivalent to âthe bus number is ambiguousâ. Note that if n is ambiguous, then so\nis n + 1 and if n is doubly ambiguous, then n + 1 is also doubly ambiguous. An examination\nof all partitions of 11 shows that 11 is not ambiguous. Thus every integer n at least 12 is\nambiguous, and every integer bigger than or equal to 13 is doubly ambiguous. The second\nmathematicianâs comment that he knew the age of the first mathematician implies that the bus number is not\ndoubly ambiguous. Thus the bus number must be 12.	Science & Mathematics

Will it collapse? . A large truck wants to cross a bridge that is 1 mile long. However the bridge can only hold 14000 lbs. The driver had then somehow calculated that the weight of the truck at that time plus his own weight is exactly 14000 lbs. The truck makes it half way across the bridge and stops. A bird lands on the truck. Does the bridge collapse? Give a reason. . THE BRIDGE DOES NOT COLLAPSE.\nThe reason is simple, after travelling half way with an additional load of 14000lbs, the weight of fuel burnt in the truck is more than enough to compensate for the weight of the bird. So, when the bird lands on the truck, the bridge does not collapse.\n\n:-)	Entertainment & Music

history of mathematics in medical? . prominent figures in respective fields.\napplication of maths in it in this field . Mathematics in medicine starts with enzyme kinetics, introducing the ideas of the Law of Mass Action, nondimensionalisation, and perturbation analysis. It also briefly introduces autocatalysis, and cooperative reactions. A pregnancy testing kit can be mathematically modelled and analysed: this will introduce the use of Laplace transforms in partial differential equations and asymptotic results. The vascular system can be discussed and solutions for pusatile blood flow will be derived. This in turn can be applied in the analysis of a catheter in the pulmonary artery which is heated one degree above blood temperature. Knowing the power input we deduce the cardiac output. Finally Infectious diseases can be discussed. In particular the SIR model is dealt with; this is followed by an analysis of a sexually transmitted disease and then the spread of rabies is considered.\n\nDavid Bernoulli was famous for his mathematics applied to medicine	Science & Mathematics

what do you understand by a communicative approach to language teaching? .  . The communicative approach tries to de-emphasize grammar and emphasize communication.  Some activies communicative teachers use are question/answer, information gap, surveys, etc.  In reading, students are encouraged to 'negotiate meaning', that is, learn to use all sorts of clues and cues to get the general thrust of the reading. (getting the gist, cognate cues, previous knowledge, etc.)\nMost second language texts in the US purport to be communicative, but if you looka them carefully, they still have a grammar syllabus.  For example, the title may be called 'friends and family' and the student goals may be to talk about friends and family, put the actual thrust of the chapter is agreement of nouns with possessives and with adjectives.  There will hardly be a verb in the whole chapter!\nI'm convinced that TPRS (Teaching Proficiency through Reading and Storytelling) is the way to go. blaineraytprs.com  I switched from an eclectic manner of teaching (TPR, grammar, communicative, project based, games) to TPRS and my students actually can communicate!  It looks like a scam when you first see it, but check it out thoroughly--it's based on the Natural Approach and Krashen's theories of language acquisition.	Education & Reference

"The saying ""if Mahommed doesn't go the mountain, the mountain will go to Mahommed""? . This is in my language (Portuguese) I don't know if there's an English equivalent. What might be the origin of this saying? . IF THE MOUNTAIN WILL NOT COME TO MOHAMMED, MOHAMMED WILL GO TO THE MOUNTAIN - ""If one cannot get one's own way, one must adjust to the inevitable. The legend goes that when the founder of Islam was asked to give proofs of his teaching, he ordered Mount Safa to come to him. When the mountain did not comply, Mohammed raised his hands toward heaven and said, 'God is merciful. Had it obeyed my words, it would have fallen on us to our destruction. I will therefore go to the mountain and thank God that he has had mercy on a stiff-necked generation.' The saying has been traced back in English to 'Essays,' (1625) by English philosopher Frances Bacon (1561-1626). It was included in John Ray's book of English proverbs in 1678. First attested in the United States in 'Jonathan Belcher Papers' (1733). In German, the phrase translates as 'Wenn der Berg nicht zum Propheten kommt, mu?der Prophetzum Berg kommen."" From ""Random House Dictionary of Popular Proverbs and Sayings"" (1996) by Gregory Y. Titelman (Random House, New York, 1996). I put the ""?"" in the German phrase because there was a do-jigger that I don't have. \n\n> p.s. BTW, the expression has no basis in the authentic tradition of prophet Mohamed (pbuh) although it is attributed to him."	Society & Culture

There are three factors that determine your eligibility for Pell:\n1.  your enrollment status (full-time, part-time, etc.)\n2.  your Cost of Attendance (COA), and\n3.  your EFC\n\nIf you are full time and your COA is at least $4,050, you can receive Pell if your EFC is $3850 or lower.  However, Pell amounts are pro-rated, so a student with a $3,850 EFC will only get $400 (at most) in Pell (for the YEAR).  Not very much, huh?\n\nThat said, as you can see on the table below, Pell is very sensitive to EFC changes, so if there were any errors on your FAFSA, you will want to correct those ASAP.  If you don't feel that your EFC is accurate, you should speak to your school.  They may allow you to submit documentation of your financial hardship which they can then use to recalculate your eligibility for Federal Aid.	Education & Reference

Does anyone know the laws regarding the use of public school property? . We like to play football on Sunday afternoons at our local High School.  We've been playing there for about nine years now.  Recently we switched to the soccar field because the field itself is really nice.  This past weekend we were playing and someone from the school said he recieved a call and told us we had to leave or he was going to call the police.  We didn't want to start any trouble, so we left. We want to find out what rights we actually have regarding this.  Being that it is the tax-payers field and all.  We have the same purpose as the school, and that's to keep the field as nice as possible.  We always move from where we played the week before and we've never left any trash.  If you have any info for me, please reply. . I can't agree with the previous poster, at least as to the law in California (and you there - the asker - you've got to tell people what state you're in when you ask these kinds of questions).\n\n\nSchools are built with public funds, and as such are public property.  They are controlled public property when school is in session (because the government has a compelling interest in keeping the school property controlled during school hours), but when students are not present, the school does not have the authority to tell you you cannot be there...conceivably on the very land your taxes helped to purchase and maintain.  \n\nSo the info I have for you is really more of a suggestion; contact the district office of the school you want to play ball at, and ask them.  If they tell you you can't be there during non-school hours, ask them for the law that says you can't.  Be polite, but be insistent.  Once you have that law (assuming it exists), read it for yourself and see what you think.  If you disagree that it says you can't be there, take it up with the school district again.\n\nNot so long ago I was faced with this exact situation...a school employee was complaining that people were on the campus, not doing anything illegal, and he wanted them removed.  I knew of no legal authority to make them do so, so they stayed on the campus (this was on a weekend).  I spoke to the District Superintendent a few days later and asked if he knew of any law that kept people off public school grounds during non-school hours.  He didn't.\n\nGood luck with this.  I hope if you get an answer from the school you'll come back here and contact me with it - I'd be interested to know what you find out.	Politics & Government

How Come There Aren't Any NEW Cemeteries Opening Up? . Honestly, so many dead the last 200 years, and where do all those dead bodies go? Where is the room to bury them all?\n\nI know there is cremation, scattering of ashes, burial underground and above ground, but really bodies take up a lot of space at the cemetery. . I have asked myself that question too so I did a little checking and I found out some information, for some cemetaries the use the stocked body solution some the cremation but what I found more interesting is that there taking existing land that belong formally to home owners and turning them in to cemetary land. I know here in California we have had plenty of scandal over the years about that and rest assure that is the question that is constantly being asked is where do the bodies go? In the cemetary my mom is buried at they have redeveloped land that was formally from owners who they have bought the land from and turned it into part of the cemetary  which now the place where my mother is at has lots of land there, we were fortunate that we got a new portion of the land before most of the land was taken because there are people dying every 24 seconds and that is true..But next time check your local cemetaries and see how much land they have left and check if they plan to redevelop land for that purpose I did and I was glad I did!

"what does 6/6/06 mean?I know that it is a date.? . Does 6/6/06 have anything to do with the movie ""The Omen""?That the devil comes or something like that. . ""Here is wisdom. Let him who has understanding calculate the number of the beast, for the number is that of a man; and his number is six hundred and sixty-six,"" (Rev. 13:18).\n\n     666 is the number of the antichrist, the end times figure who will arise with the purpose of opposing God and God's people.  666 is the gamatria of the name of the antichrist. \n     In Greek and Hebrew there are no numeric characters.  There are only alpha characters.  For example, the letters a, b, c, d, e, f, etc. are alpha characters.  The numbers 0, 1, 2, 3, etc., are numeric characters.  They are different -- except for the letter ""o"" and the number ""0"".  When the Greeks wanted to write a number, they used letters for numbers.  The Greek letter ""alpha"" had the numeric equivalent of 1.  The next letter ""beta"" has the numeric equivalent of 2, and so on.  (CARM has a chart of the Hebrew and Greek numeric equivalents if you are interested in more information.) \n     Therefore, whenever a word in Greek is written, because the letters are also numbers, every word has a numeric value.  This numeric value is called a gematria.  The Greek word for Jesus (IhsouV) has a mathematical equivalent of 888.  Also, the Greek word for fish is 1224. \n     What the Bible is saying is that the future antichrist will have a name that when it is written in Greek, its numeric equivalent will be 666."

How can you get rid of reoccurring mouth sores? .  . Depending upon which kind...Canker or cold sore?   (in the mouth) Canker sores are often connected to stomach problems bacteria or stress.  Look up apthous ulcers and stomatitis so you can better understand them and help yourself.  If you also have stomach problems of any sort, it could be related.  Stress, poor diet(acidic foods such as coffee, chocolate (sorry) meats and vinegars can add to the problem) or any bacterial infection could be contributing to these sores.  \n\nIf it's cold sores(on the mouth), LYSINE pills are good for suppressing viruses(herpes simplex).  There are also LYSINE balms for this topically.  \n\nFor Canker sores, soothing and healing the stomach lining helps.  You can  look into is DGL-deglycerrized licorice.   This excellent supplement helps heal the stomach lining which can then help with canker sores.  I used to get them all the time...I also had constant stomach aches due to stress!!  So maybe this will help??  Teas made from mucalents like slippery elm, marshmallow can help soothe the stomach.  Ginger is also good for the stomach.  As far as the sore itself, avoid acidic foods, keep the mouth clean.   Goldenseal powder(yuck but effective) is a good natural antibacterial/biotic to heal wounds.  Use a little on the wound once a day. It's an immune enhancer.\n\nMostly figure out what's going on in your own body by looking at all symptoms, reading and then connecting the dots, so to speak!  \nGood luck!	Health

Below I included a portion of our states statute.

The requirement for you to have a license depends on the government agency you work for. If they require that you have a license in addition to your identification then yes, you must have a license while operating a government vehicle. If they don't require a state license then you don't need one.\nIf you wish to drive your private vehicle then yes, you need a state issued license.\n\n31-7-107.

I feel old when I see kids with LiveJournals and doing stuff online that I didn't start using until I was 18.\n\nAlso, cellphones.

In San Diego the same house would cost almost a million dollars.\n\nQuality of life.  In San Diego I was constantly stressed for money and felt like I lived in an over-populated area.  Everywhere you go there are people swarming like bees.  Not so in the Midwest.  Here you can drive down a road or walk through a shopping mall and it just feels right.  Less people, less congestion, less traffic.\n\nDon't think that there is nothing to do out here.  I live in Omaha and it's a HUGE restaurant city.  People here LOVE to eat out and there is a great restaurant on every corner.  And they are affordable!  Music is big in Omaha too.  The local music scene is big and growing.  Lots of great local bands are from here, including The Faint and Cursive.\n\nThings cost less!  I used to spend $2500 a month just to get by in San Diego.  Here my basic bills are under $1600.  My rent in San Diego for a tiny 1 bedroom apartment in a nice area of town was $1400.  Ridiculous!  Here I pay $900 and I live in a 1500 square foot two bedroom condo with garage in the best part of town.\n\nBottom line - I love the Midwest now, and I came from Southern California!  Consider it.

"atoms????????????? . the question is elements that have a different number of neutrons and protons are called:\n\nanswer please. . Atoms are electrically neutral if they have an equal number of protons and electrons. Atoms which have either a deficit or a surplus of electrons are called ions. Electrons that are furthest from the nucleus may be transferred to other nearby atoms or shared between atoms. By this mechanism atoms are able to bond into molecules and other types of chemical compounds like ionic and covalent network crystals.\n[edit] Elements, isotopes and ions\nAtoms with the same atomic number Z share a wide variety of physical properties and exhibit almost identical chemical properties (for the closest instance to an exception to this principle, see deuterium and heavy water). Atoms are classified into chemical elements by their atomic number Z, which corresponds to the number of protons in the atom. For example, all atoms containing six protons (Z = 6) are classified as carbon. The elements may be sorted according to the periodic table in order of increasing atomic number. When this is done, certain repeating cycles of regularities in chemical and physical properties are evident.\n\nThe mass number A, or nucleon number of an element is the total number of protons and neutrons in an atom of that element, so-called because each proton and neutron has a mass of about 1 amu. A particular collection of a certain number of protons Z, and neutrons A-Z, is called a nuclide.\n\nEach element can have numerous different nuclides with the same Z (number of protons and electrons) but varying numbers of neutrons. Such a family of nuclides are called the isotopes of the element (isotope = ""same place"", because these nuclides share the same chemical symbol and place on the periodic table). When writing the name of a particular nuclide, the element name (which specifies the Z) is preceded by the mass number if written as a superscript, or else followed by the mass number if not a superscript. For example, the nuclide carbon-14, which may also be written 14C, is one of the isotopes of carbon, and it contains 6 protons and 8 neutrons in each atom, for a total mass number of 14. For a complete table of known nuclides, including radioactive and stable nuclides, see isotope table (divided)."	Science & Mathematics

My  boyfriend and I have been tring to have a baby for about a year we're both in are early 20's .What should . What should I do I really what to have a little baby? . Yeah I'm with her. Get married first, but don't get married because you to want a baby together because that's not the way to go. The to of you should really love each other enough before you even consider marriage or a baby! Out of that love a child should be conceived, and not because one or the other of you just wants to have a baby. Seriously, think about it before you have the WHAT-IF'S ans WHAT COULD HAVE BEEN thoughts in you mind.	Health
who are the Soninke? .  . The Soninke (also called Sarakole, Seraculeh, or 'Serahuli) are a MandÃ© people who were the founders of the ancient empire of Ghana c. 750-1240 CE). After contact with Muslim Almoravid traders from the north around 1066, the Soninke nobles of neighboring Takrur embraced Islam, being the earliest sub-Saharan ethnic group to follow the teachings of Muhammad. The Ghana empire dispersed, resulting in a diaspora which today finds Soninkes in Mali, Senegal, Mauritania, Gambia, and Guinea-Bissau.\n\nLinguistically, their nearest relatives are the speakers of the Bozo languages, centered around the Niger Inland Delta.

If you were selling coffee makers machines, what would u give as an offer added to it? or as a gift? . or a discount on what other product?\nI thought about a box of coffe cups and mugs that could come along as an offer with the coffee machine but then again, most of the cafe's such as starbucks(who would be my target market to see the machines to) have their own cups and mugs, why would they be interested in my offer?\nso what other offer would be impressive? . What kind of coffee makers are you selling? Ones for the actual store like Starbucks to use or for them to sell in their store?\n\nIf you want to market your product in their store you may want to co-brand with them. Offer to put their logo or a coupon for their coffee with your maker so that when a customer buys it you benefit and Starbucks benefits. Make the coupon only good for the intial purchase.\n\nBuy this coffee maker and get 50% off of 1-lb of Starbucks coffee.\n\nIf on the other hand you are marketing your coffee maker to stores like Starbucks for them to use then you have a tougher road to go.\n\nThink from the perspective of the store owner - how would using your coffee maker benefit me the store owner? Why should I use yours and how can you make it appealing to me?\n\nThe first thing I'm interested in as a business person is the product not the freebies or the offers. Those are secondary. So sell the benefits and then the add ons.\n\nWhy not consider free replacement or service contract for 6 months or 1 year?\n\nAnother might be - emergency replacement makers provided within 24-hours of notification.

Iam very  much interested in astrology, iam a libran, DOB 27/09/1981. Whats my life gona be like?? . whats my career & married life gona be like? and ofcourse my future? . Libra woman mostly has an egg oval facial shape.  She has a nice smooth skin and a good figure. She will spent so much efforts to  keep her skin clean and pretty. She can be easily allergy to cosmetic and make  up, but taken care of her face and avoid wrinkle is her hobby. She is good at it  and tend to look younger than her age.   \n\nShe can be very naughty like a little boy, but yet  fully 100% woman. She looks nice in either Jean or night gown. She thinks woman  is equal to man. Sometimes she can think faster than you, but she will not leave  you far behind. She will try not to make you feel like you are competed or  defeated in any games she plays with you even she is winning.   \n\nShe is a little flirt even she has no idea what she  wants. She can not decide what to do, and what not to do, so she can not set her  schedule very well in all cases.   \n\nShe is gifted with how to dress, and how to match  her dress. She likes to dress in black and wear perfume. She likes a mild  flowery scent. \n\nIn any argument, she can really  argue. She can argue for hours, and mostly win the argument. If it is not a  serious argument, she could argue and once a while give you a smile also. She  will make a good politician, because she can tell which party will win the  election. \n\nShe always has a good reasons ,even she likes to  contradict herself. She can not decide what is right and wrong for her, because  everything has a good side and a bad side. Woman in other Zodiac might not care  what other people think, but Libra woman care what other people ,or what you  feel as much as her own feeling.   \n\nShe can adjust to her environment very well, so at  work she will be at the ladder up. She likes team work in doing things. If you  ask her for help or advice, she will help you except if she does not like your  guts. She can change you and make you think you change by yourself without her  influence. \n\nGood side of being with Libra  woman are she never interfere with your privacy. She will not make you loose  face in front of your friends. Even she cares about how much money she has left  his her bank account, she will never forget to let you know how much she cares  for you. \n\nShe think taken care of the house is a woman job  and she can do it well. But if you expect a Libra woman to fear you, then you  are wrong. She is a strong woman even she looks at you with that sweet innocent  pairs of baby's looks and may loose you (let you win) in a few poker games.   \n\nIf she is the one you are after, then go step by  step. The best way is using her friends introducing you to her. Do not make her  feel or treat her like a bubble head. You have to move forward toward her with  confident and secure. Show her that you are a kind , polite and a real  gentleman. Be a slow hand or else you might get smack!	Entertainment & Music

I think online dating is worth a shot, but you need to make sure to keep your expectations in check.  Personally, I've met two great guys through online dating and probably 50 not-so-great guys in between.  It can work; and it does sometimes.  I dated a guy I met online for 3 years and he wanted to get married, but I wasn't ready.  Then I met a different guy who I dated for a year and a half.  So yes, it is worth trying; I was only 19 when I met the first guy...  I don't know if someone who's 25 and really serious about dating will want to date someone who is 19, but you never know, where you are in life is more important than age anyway.

What are orchids? .  . Orchids (Orchidaceae family) are among the biggest and most diverse of the flowering plant (Angiospermae) families, with over 800 described genera and 25,000 species. Some sources give 30,000 species, but the exact number is unknown since classification differs greatly in the academic world. Revisions of different genera occur on a monthly basis and this will increase with the growing use of genetic research and biochemistry. There are another 100,000+ hybrids and cultivars produced by horticulturalists, created since the introduction of tropical species in the 19th century. The Kew World Checklist of Orchids includes about 24,000 accepted species. About 800 new species are added each year. Orchids, through their interactions with pollinators and their symbiosis with mycorrhizae fungi, are considered by some, along with the grasses, to be examples of the most complex floral evolution known.\n\ncheck out this page!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!1\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orchidaceae	Education & Reference

Do you believe in God? .  . Do you know what it took to even ask the question? You have a physical machine called a body that is able to use its mind to ponder the question, relay visual information from a physical world of comparable low-tech computers through the optic nerve, into the brain, with the mind to comprehend the ramifications, then transfer that thought process to an incredibly complex systems of nerves, tendons, and touch to the fingers to type the letters. This then communicates a question of the soul. The soul is something that science cannot a.) explain and b.) create. It can only mimic with unsatisfactory results. That soul is concerned for the existence of an eternal destiny beyond time and space--that there is a world beyond the physical world we see in the here and now. The free-will to choose to believe or not believe. A being that can love, write poetry, paint or play works of incredible complexity and beauty. To smell, and taste, enjoy. So, like you, I set out on a path to find my Creator. It is obvious that He exists, but is He personal or an impersonal force? My answer came through the study of prophecy in the Bible. Like the DNA strand and life itself, it was hard to dispute the evidence. Now with the realization of the truth of the Bible, God made it clear that He was not only a personal God, but One who wanted to know ME, and that He knew everything about me--the number of every hair on my head (which lowers daily).

"what is the cost of biomass? . I woud like to know the cost of biomass. if possible i would also like to know the conservation and the efficiency of biomass. . I'm not sure exactly what you're getting at with this question. Biomass just refers to any organic substance on the planet: plants, animals, bacteria...  See first link below.\n\nWhen people talk about the relative ""cost"" of biomass, they are often comparing the amount of water and energy it takes to create a certain amount of plant biomass (e.g., 1 kg of wheat) vs the same amount of animal biomass (e.g., 1 kg of steak). Because of the way the food chain works, it takes a lot more resources to create meat for consumption than it does to produce a plant-based (vegetarian) diet. A lot of people therefore eat vegetarian because it's better for the environment (and the earth can sustain a LOT more people on a vegetarian diet.) See second link below for details.\n\nBiomass can also be burned for energy  - e.g. chaff, manure, or peat. This is usually called biofuel. The efficiency depends on the material, but like all methods of producing energy, there is some pollution generated by burning.\n\nI hope this is helpful."	Science & Mathematics

If your property was zoned conservancy without your consent, and you were required to obtain a conditional use permit anytime your were to improve your property by 15% or more of it's value.  Would you continue with the improvement? . NO!\n\nThe people of this country seriously need to lobby. The latest Supreme Court ruling regarding E.D. is NOT a good thing for property owners. Becuase the Supreme Court is the final say, what needs to be done is citizens need to write and pressure local and state officials as well as Congress to get laws in place to protect property owners.

"Why does ebay allow some sellers (power sellers) to sell Items that I'm not allowed to sell? . I have tried listing in the past on ebay: Jarts, among other items that ebay has kicked off for safety reasons, but they still allow others selling the exact same items to continue to list and sell them.  When I email ebay about this, I just receive an email saying they are dangerous and against ebay policy to allow selling them.  Why does this apply to only me?  It really sounds predjadous.  Ebay doesn't have any live people to contact about this.  I've even worded my ads just like the others that don't get ejected. . Power Sellers bring in money for them (moreso than other sellers). Plus, they have access to a direct line at Ebay where they can talk to a live person to get problems resolved. Thus, their ""squeaky wheel"" is much louder. Besides, Ebay does not care about too much of anything except money. Look up their child pornography sometime. They turn a blind eye to quite a bit."	Business & Finance

"what is quantum mechanics all about? .  . ""Quantum mechanics is a physical science dealing with the behaviour of matter and waves on the scale of atoms and subatomic particles. It also forms the basis for the contemporary understanding of how large objects such as stars and galaxies, and cosmological events such as the Big Bang, can be analyzed and explained. Its success is due to its accurate prediction of the physical behaviour of systems, including systems where Newtonian mechanics fails. This difference between the success of classical and quantum mechanics is most often observed in systems at the atomic scale or smaller, or at very low or very high energies, or at extremely low temperatures. Quantum mechanics is the basis of modern developments in chemistry, molecular biology, and electronics, and the foundation for the technology that has transformed the world in the last fifty years."""

We cannot even be sure if all of our 'past' was just fed into us at one single moment, or if it really did exist.How can we know for sure that the world really exist or if we are 'something' stationary and just that the signals are continuosly being fed into us?The dream state gives more proof for this, coz even in a dream we can feel, touch, hear, smell and see our body someplace else(a different world),which actually doesn't exist in reality!And what happens when we r in deep sleep- no senses,no world, no people-nothing!\n\nI found this to be a bizarre concept, but couldn't find anything to prove it wrong either.

The Rebellion started with petitions to the government for paper currency, lower taxes, and judicial reform. When this failed, the farmers took more drastic measures. The first target of the Rebellion was the Court of Common Pleas at Northampton, which an armed body of farmers kept from sitting on August 29th. Similar groups of insurgents stormed the courts at Worcester, Concord, Taunton, and Great Barrington in the following weeks.

"How to find wormholes in the universe? .  . Wormholes can probably exist and are around us all the time.  The only problem is that they are very, very, very small.  They exist only on a quantum level, and could theoretically be seen if you could look a things on a quantum level.  If you could look look at things on this level then you would observe what is called ""quantum foam"".  It is in this that you would see wormholes.  One problem though, is that these wormholes, once they appear, would close up and disappear again very quickly.  \n\nAgain, theoretically, you could hold one of these open, IF you had a strong and dense enough material.  But this material would have to be more dense than anything that anyone knows about.\n\nJust as a side note - blackholes cannot be wormholes.  Blackholes are a different phenomena to wormholes.  A wormhole is a traversable bridge between two areas of space.  A blackhole is a supermassive star that has collapsed back in on itself, creating so much gravity that not even light can escape.  Plus, the singularity of the blackhole is protected by an ""event-horizon"", which if anything fell it will be lost forever."	Science & Mathematics

"based on odds, how many hours might it take to shuffle a deck of cards back into order? . In order of number and suit, just as if you openned the deck for the first time. Also assuming that you aren't really trying to shuffle them into order. Based on the odds of this being a happenstance. . Shuffling is pretty complex as you probably mean a riffle shuffle or something like that.  But let's assume you're shuffling by spreading out all the cards on the table, and randomly picking them.\n\nAssuming you want the cards in a specific order, then for each card, you'd have to randomly select the ""right"" card.  For the first card, you have 52 to choose from, and a 1/52 chance of getting it right.  For the second card, you now have 51 to choose from and thus a 1/51 chance of getting it right...on down to the last card.\n\nSo your odds are:\n\n1/52 * 1/51 * 1/50 * 1/49 * ... * 1/3 * 1/2 * 1/1\n\nor 1/52! or about 1/8*10^69.  To put that in perspective, lets say all 6 billion people on earth are shuffling one trillion times a second (man is that fast shuffling!) for a billion years, you're still not even in the ball park of being close (1/10^30) of having one person get it right."

"What is the best g-spot on a girl. I want to try it out at school tomorrow? .  . Every woman has a G-spot.  The G spot is a zone about 2 or 3 inches inside the vagina on the front wall of her vagina (if sheâs standing up) or the âroofâ of her vagina (if sheâs lying on her back.),closest to the pubic bone. With the right technique and a bit of practice, it can yield lots and lots of pleasure for women including orgasm, multiple orgasms and female ejaculation.\n\nThe G spot itself feels like a very subtle bump 2 or 3 inches inside a womanâs vagina, about 1 to 2 inches in diameter. Itâs almost unfindable until the woman is excited. When her partner hits it right, she'll know!\n\nThe important things are foreplay, having the woman bring her knees up to her chest, and hard pressure on her G spot. Hard pressure on the G spot is vital, since it doesn't respond to light rubbing or stroking, only heavy, deep massaging. Another important thing is that the massaging partner must have VERY short nails, or she will feel scraped inside laterânot pleasant.\n\nForeplay builds her sexual excitement and fills her vaginal and clitoral areas with blood - the equivalent of a man getting an erection. Lots of foreplay makes any sexual touch much more pleasurable. If you go straight to G spot massage with no foreplay it won't work!\n\nHer partner lies between her legs, then gently places his fingers two or three inches inside her vagina.  He then makes a ""come here"" motion with his fingers, massaging first gently, then harder, eventually using lots of pressure.\n\nG-spot massage makes some women feel like they have to pee. Not likely, but thatâs what it feels like. So she should pee before you get started, and put a towel down on the bed. Sheâs not going to pee, but she has to get used to the feeling, and that takes some practice sometimes."	Business & Finance

what is a salary of an assistant professor? . What is the monthly salary of an assistant professor (PHD)in a canadian university?? . I'm about to complete my Ph.D.   I and many in my cohort have just accepted positions as assistant professors in U.S. universities.  I can't give you precise info on Canadian pay, but I know enough to tell you that the pay will vary widely with the subject area, size and type of university, and the market that particular year.  I've seen offers everywhere from $33,000 to $120,000 U.S.  Most packages seem to be between $40 and 60,000, but it is usually much less in the arts, and on the higher end in engineering, business, or the sciences.  Again, this is all U.S. numbers, but it's pretty much the same job market, so I suspect there won't be much difference (aside from the conversion rates), because the Canadian schools hire in the same conferences that the U.S. schools do, so they must pay in the same range to be competitive.\n\nAlso, it doesn't really pay to think about monthly salary.  They will mostly quote you yearly salaries, but it is often a 9-month contract, and in many cases, you'll have the choice of whether to add to it by teaching over the summer.	Business & Finance

My crank makes a creaking sound??? . When my left foot is on the downstroke my crank assembly makes a creaking sound.  Everything seems to be tight but the noise is getting annoying.

But until you put a significant load on them, they won't make a noise.\n\nYou can tighten the bottom bracket yourself if you have a crank removal tool and a bottom bracket tool.  One of the reasons that the bottom bracket doesn't get installed tight enough is that it doesn't want to turn freely in the shell.  When you remove the bottom bracket, clean the threads really well and re-install using a liberal amount of grease.  Of course, if this is all too much for you, take it down to a decent bike shop and ask them to tighten up the bottom bracket.	Sports

My white blood cell count is high at 15...is this really bad? . I am 27/f...just got back from hospital. Had some shooting stars in my vision and then a massive headache. My blood pressure was elevated 156/88, BS 92, TEMP 97.2, Was given a CT scan that came back normal. The Dr. said the only thing bad in the blood work was WBC a little high. Should I be worried about this. He didnt seem to be, but after researching on here it seems this number is a bit high? . If your White Blood Count 15,000 it is a bit high, because the normal value maximum is 10,000.The high WBC indicate infection, you should consult he doctor and ask for further laboratory diagnostic test to confirm the causes of high WBC.\nContact me at\nrwnug@yahoo.com or YM with id rwnug or \nmy blog http://rwnug.multiply.com or\nhttp://www.friendster.com/rwindu\nThanks...!

"Is Jesus the Son of God or  is He God? . i believe Jesus was God in the flesh . According to the Bible, Jesus is God, and has always been God.  But in order to accomplish the salvation of man, He laid aside that right, and took a position that was less then God - that of His Son - and humbled Himself to God as His Father being obedient even to the point of dying on the cross.  Because of that, He was raised from the dead and returned to the position of full Godship with His Father.  (Read Phillippians 2: 6-11).\n\nIn the Jewish culture that Jesus lived, to term translated ""the son of..."" was a legal term that referred to someone who had all the rights and power of their father.  To refer to Jesus as ""the son of God"" meant the He had all the rights and power of God.  It is differrent that what we think of when we hear the English term ""the son of..."".  This is why during Jesus' trial before the Jews, when He referred to Himself as ""the son of God"", the high priest torn his garment and called him a blasphemer, because He made Himself equal with God.\n\nYou may debate all day whether or not Jesus was divine, but there is no room for debate over whether the Bible SAYS Jesus was divine.  There are hundreds of refers to His divinity in it.\n\nSo the answer is: Jesus, by claiming to be the Son of God, was claiming to be God.  They are the same thing."	Education & Reference

"Does anyone have any creative wedding ideas? . I'm getting married next June and I want my wedding to be really unique. Does anybody have any special ideas? We're getting married by the lake. . 1. For a unique party favor my groom and I are giving out lottery tickets. Only $1 each.. I will have a note in the program stating the tickets were chosen because we are so lucky to have our family and friends with us on our wedding day.\nI will also add a line that all winnings will need to be split with the bride and groom!\n\n 2. Instead of having an ordinary guestbook, that you hardly will look at again, I am going to create a photo guest book.  My guestbook attendants will take polaroids of each guest... either individually or in a group, however they come, and put it on the pages of the guestbook/scrapbook.  The guests will then sign on the bottom of their picture.  My fiance and I will then have a photo album of all the guests at our wedding! :) GST\n\n3. We are getting married next year and instead of the traditional wedding we have decided to go with a ""rock-n-roll"" theme. We are going to have records displayed around the hall with our names on them and a picture of the two of us. Our colors are navy blue, black and silver so there will be plenty of those colorsâ¦from the silver glitter on the black tables cloths to the silver spray painted roses.\n\n 4. Since this is a second marriage and there are children that will be blended into a new family, we are decorating the tables at the reception with photo trees holding photos of my future husband and I and our children doing things together. We feel it shows that this marriage is not the union of just two people, but the formation of a new family.\n\n5. We had a shortage of single men and women invited to our wedding, most of our friends and family were already married.  So we needed to come up with something different to replace the traditional bouquet and garter throwing.  We invited everyone to the dance floor and the dj played several lovely, slow songs.  First the dj told all couples married two hours or less to sit down (everyone got a kick out of that).  Then a few moments later, any married a year or less, than five years, ten years and so on, until there was only one couple left.  They were neighbors and friends of my family and had been married for fifty years.  We asked them to stay on the dance floor while I took a seat and my husband made a big show of removing my garter.  We then faced the winning couple, congratulated them on their fifty years and asked them for their best marriage advice as we presented them with the bouquet and garter.  They were very touched and it gave us a great feeling too."	Family & Relationships

why did god make pain? .  . Certain physical pains God gave us so we would know if something was wrong.  It wouldn't be very fun to catch on fire and not realize it.  The pain is there so we will stop the problem.  As far as emotional pain, it's just something else that lets us know we're alive.  Just because you're in pain, doesn't mean that God hates you, or thinks you need to be punished.  Sometimes God gives us pain, so we'll remember to turn to him for help.  Remember, he created us because he wanted something to love.  If you pray to Him, and let Him know you love Him, and that He's first in your life, a lot of times the pain, be it physical or emotional, will go away.  Sometimes pain takes time to heal, but if you keep your faith in God, He'll carry you until your ready to stand.\n\nAnd don't forget to go to a pastor, or someone else you feel comfortable talking with.  Talking with others helps you get through almost anything.	Business & Finance

What is the world coming to? . I have seen alot of questions about people be gay or not. HONESTLY, who cares if someone is gay or not? The way I see it, we were all put here for a reason, GAY OR NOT... it should not matter if we are or not, as long as we fill what we were put here to do. . I think your question is very interesting. What the world is coming to is very involved in what you are asking as well as other sins.\n\nIt matters a great deal whether a person is homosexual or not. The Bible says it is an abomination to God. God destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah for their sins, one of their most predominent being homosexuality.\nyou can read more here :\nhttp://www.chick.com/reading/tracts/5003/5003_01.asp\n\nThe legalization of abortion, homosexuality etc is going to lead to the judgement of our country make no mistake. Some judgement has already come.\n\nAs far as what the world is coming to.The Bible has the answer to that also. \n2Timothy 3:1 This know also, that in the last days perilous times shall come.\n 2 For men shall be lovers of their own selves, covetous, boasters, proud, blasphemers, disobedient to parents, unthankful, unholy,\n 3 Without natural affection, trucebreakers, false accusers, incontinent, fierce, despisers of those that are good,\n 4 Traitors, heady, highminded, lovers of pleasures more than lovers of God;\n 5 Having a form of godliness, but denying the power thereof: from such turn away.\n\nYou can't deny that is a very good description of the world we live in.\n\nHope is found in the Lord Jesus Christ. He died for our sins and arose the third day that we might be saved. God's wrath and judgement is coming to this earth - only those who have trusted in the Lord Jesus Christ will escape that wrath.\nRevelation 6:17 For the great day of his wrath is come; and who shall be able to stand?\nIf you really want to know more about what the world is coming to read this :\nhttp://www.chick.com/reading/tracts/5025/5025_01.asp\n\nAs far as being put here for a reason - you are right - we were put here for a reason. The Bible tells us in Revelation 4:11, that reason is to please God. If one is living in sin that is not pleasing to God. Hebrews 11:6a tells us that without faith it is impossible to please God. Faith in what?  Faith in God's Word, in the Lord Jesus Christ. The only way to please God is to be reconciled with Him through the blood of the Lord Jesus. When we trust Him as our Saviour that pleases God. When we live our lives according to His Word that pleases God. That is our purpose on this earth.	Society & Culture

Still, even with optimal medication treatment, many people with the illness have some residual symptoms.

Maybe stop helping so much, just be supportive, and let him know you are available if he wants help or just to talk to.

"Please read before judging, should the age of consent be abolished? . Human beings grow & evolve at different rates. when it comes to maturity, one size does not fit all.\n\nSome people are PHYSICALLY ready in early teens, and yet there are people in their 20's who are not emotionally ready for sex.\n\nThoughts please.... . Just because a person ""believes"" they are emotionally ready for sex does not mean that they are intellectually capable of making that decision. Children in their early teens (and I do mean children - even if some people may find that condescending) have not developed or learned enough to make smart, informed decisions about sex. Remember that children in that time of life are going through incredible physiological changes. Hormones affect the mental and emotional state, as well as, the physical state of the individual. They're becoming more aware of their sexuality, personal relationships, that their future lies ahead, that they are growing up. It is a very exciting and rewarding time of life, but it is also a very confusing time.\nIt is because of the vulnerability of children at this stage that society has decided it is necessary to protect them from certain aspects of life (cars, guns, alcohol, SEX...) by making it illegal for them to participate fully until they reach a certain age - an age at which an individual may be better equiped to make those decisions. An age at which that individual may be less likely to fall victim to a cunning, manipulative, desperate sexual predator."	Politics & Government
"What are the 'Hare Krishna Hindu practisers' doing, trying to make a joke of the whole religion???? .

Publicise hinduism??I am a hindu and it annoys me to see this ridicule!\nKindly do not give me lectures from the bible or racist answers! . I think Native Americans feel the same about the sudden popularity of ""shamans"" and sweat lodges among those who don't know.  And I've also heard that some Muslims, at least, have issues with the Nation of Islam.  \n\nI think in all cases, it starts with someone on a spiritual quest trying to find something to bring them closer to God.  They do not intend to mock, but they do not study in depth.  They take a few ideas, some rituals, and cobble together something they feel comfortable with.  They do not intend to offend and I don't think they realize they do.  Then they pick up followers who have less of an idea....\n\nPlease don't feel that they are mocking you or your beliefs.  They aren't -- they just don't understand.  They mean well and they may indeed be extremely religious -- just not in the way you are used to!  It is possible to be extremely religious and sincere in your longing to draw closer to God without understanding the history or beliefs behind some of the rituals you have copied.\n\nIt is possible to be a Christian without following the rituals of the Catholic church.  There are many varieties of Christians, Muslims, etc.  From my reading, I think there are also many varieties of Hindus.  Can't you just see them as a small sect -- even if they don't understand your religion as you do?  I'm sure it would be easier for you to do that than it is for most Christians to deal with the Westboro Baptist Church (the bigots who picket funerals of gays) or for moderate Muslims to deal with having their religion smeared by the actions of a few terrorists."

how do we measure the radius of earth back in the 15th century? .  . The previous answerer gave one method that was actually used in antiquity and gave a very good answer. Other methods involved looking at the horizon from the top of a mountain and trying to measure the angle down to the horizon from a level. That can be used to figure out the size of the earth, but the angle tends to be too small to give much accuracy. Many scholars in the 15th century, though relied on this figure more than the one done by the stick method (which was much more accurate). This is part of why they thought the earth was so much smaller than it really is.	Science & Mathematics

"What does it mean to be clinically depressed? . What are the symptoms? And can it be cured? . I've suffered from depression my whole life, while it hasnt been cured, it can certainly be managed with medications.  You can search depression on almost any site and get the answer to your question.  Usually, it starts with a depressed, or sad mood.  What is depression?\n\nDepression is a mood disorder that causes you to feel sad or hopeless for an extended period of time. More than just a bout of ""the blues"" or temporary feelings of grief or low energy, depression can have a significant impact on your enjoyment of life, your work, your health, and the people you care about. \n\nDepression affects people differently. Some feel down for extended periods of time; for others the feelings of depression come and go. If you have short episodes of mild depression, you may be able to continue to work and take care of daily activities. However, if you do not seek some form of treatment for your depression, you are at risk for getting more depressed or becoming physically ill. In severe cases, depression can cause people to become incapable of communicating, unable to do routine activities, or suicidal. In these cases, it is essential to seek medical attention.\n\nPeople with depression may be reluctant to seek help because they feel that it is a sign of personal weakness or a character flaw or that they should be able to ""pull out of it"" on their own. We now know that depression, like other medical conditions, has a chemical and biological basis. Treatment for depression is safe and usually effective even for severely depressed people.\n\nIf you think you may have depression, take a short quiz to evaluate your symptoms:\n\n'check out yahoo health for further info.

"How can you relate the osmosis process to the process of semi-permeable membranes and capillary beds? .

(possibly one I could get a visual (mental) picure of.\n\nthanks so much for any help\nRN student . Basically the semi-permeable membranes and capillary beds carry out osmosis. Osmosis is the passive diffusion of water molecules from a higher water potential to a lower water potential. Water moves from an area with higher concentration of water to an area with less water until the concentration of water in both areas become equal. Semi-permeable membranes and capillaries have thin walls that allow the passage of water. Thus water can move according to its concentration across the membranes."	Science & Mathematics

Mario Ancic?? . Do you know a lot about Mario Ancic, and his career?? . Tennis career\n\nJuniors and pre ATP\n\nMario AnÄiÄ was born in Split, and started playing tennis at the age of seven.\n\nHe became one of the top junior tennis players in the world. In 1999, he represented Croatia in the NEC World Youth Cup, helping them to the runners-up position. He also made his debut for Croatia in Davis Cup in the tie against Portugal in a dead-rubber against Joao Cunha-Silva, but lost in straight sets. He ended his first year as a junior as world number 24.\n\nAnÄiÄ kept up the good work in 2000, reaching the final at Jr. Boys Wimbledon at the age of 16, where he lost to Nicolas Mahut of France in three sets. He was also a finalist at the Jr. Australian Open and semifinalist at the Jr. U.S. Open, losing to Andy Roddick on both occasions. The same year he won his first futures tournament in Zagreb, beating Ivo KarloviÄ in the final. In Davis Cup play, he won his rubber against Latvia and finished the year as world number four among the juniors.\n\nIn 2000, AnÄiÄ played alongside countryman Goran IvaniÅ¡eviÄ in the doubles event at the Sydney Olympics, losing in the first round.\n\n2001 saw AnÄiÄ reach the finals at the China and Canada futures events.\n\nIn 2002, AnÄiÄ compiled a record of 30-16 in Challenger play, winning the title in Belgrade after defeating Nenad ZimonjiÄ of Serbia and Montenegro. He followed this up with runner up efforts in Ho Chi Minh and Kyoto.\n\nATP tour career\n\nHis debut at an ATP event was at Miami where he lost to Adrian Voinea in the first round. The clear highlight of his season came on his Grand Slam debut at Wimbledon, where he qualified and caused a major upset by defeating then world number 9 Roger Federer on Centre Court in the first round. In doing so he became the first teenager to win on his Wimbledon debut on Center Court since BjÃ¶rn Borg triumphed in 1973.

By giving him an allowance and making sure he can now see how much they are saving and spending she allows him to be involved and hopefully he learns how to cope.

This way she's helping him take some responsibility. \n\nAs far as doing housework he's the same, you've enabled him by being his surrogate  ""mother"" he doesn't feel the need to do these things.

When people talk about compressing the golf ball what do they mean? . I saw an interview and a golfer mentioned that when it's cold it's harder to compress the golf ball.  I think he even said that because it's harder to compress the golf ball his shots don't travel as far.  Can someone explain how compressing the golf ball helps my shots travel farther and how does one go about compressing the golf ball. . It is about the laws of motion and the physics of a collision.  The collision here is the the golf iron colliding with the golf ball - the iron of course transfering enough energy to the golf ball to send it winging through the air. It is also about efficiency.  The heavy mass at the end of long thin pole allows a faster swing, thus increasing the opportunity to impart momentum to the golf ball.  Newton's three laws explain all this. See below.\n\nFor the second piece of effiency one must understand elastic collisions transfer energy better than inelastic collisions.  To make the collision between iron and ball more elastic, the ball is built with a spongy center and flexible shell.  Thus when the iron hits the ball it momentary deforms so as to mimic an elastic collision and thus capture more of the iron's energy.	Sports
"what is the treatment of phobia from airplane? .  . I'm curious what kind of trauma you might have experienced that involved a plane.\n\nIt's probably normal to have some fear involving flying (which I presume is the fear you're having).  It's important to remind yourself whenever you have a ""phobia"" (an incapacitating fear) that there's risk involved with everything you experience and do, and that some things you deal with are much riskier than the thing for which you're phobic, and of those riskier things, you deal with them with a relatively large amount of confidence.\n\nThe statistics with respect to dying on an airplane are very low.  In fact,  you are much more likely to die in a car accident than in a plane accident.\n\nWhen I get afraid of flying, I tell myself a few things:\n\n- While it's terrifying that I might not have control over my fate when in a plane, it's very bothersome to spend a whole flight worried.  So, calm down and accept that I've made a choice to do this.\n\n- It is unlikely that the plane will crash.  Look at the confident flight attendant, who has likely flown all week, for months, perhaps even years.  Look at her when there is turbulence, and you will see that it means little to her.  This is a reminder that you too can be confident if you so choose.\n\n- If being prepared in case of an emergency is a concern, make sure you go over the safety information for the plane, plus note where the exits are for each plane you're on.  Measure out what you expect would be your emergency exit path should there be one.  Being prepared mentally may mean a more successful exit should there be an emergency.\n\nThose are some ideas.\n\nBut you can't measure these ideas unless you get on a plane.  You can, however, work them out beforehand in your mind to an extent.  The true test will come when you book your next flight and board.\n\nAnd you'll likely have even greater success in overcoming your phobia if you fly much more often: Each flight you take will make flying less and less significant to you, meaning that your fear will quell as you build successful flying experience.\n\nVery good luck!"

Since he is so blatant does he know that I know and wants me to know or can he be totally oblivious and thinks I don't know? I don't actually mind, since he is pretty attractive. . Putting feelings aside and trying to JUST answer your question... If the guy is saring at your breasts and is obvious about it, I don't think he is so taken with the ""twins"" that he doesn't know you see him. Again putting feelings aside... If you are interested in him and want to know for sure make a pass at him or get him alone and flash him. Good luck! \n\n(As for my feelings... I kinda agree with the others. He is married and even if he is interested, it seems like he is a dog and only interested in a date with the ""twins"")"	Family & Relationships

two arguments against capital punishment and two not against it? .  . Assuming that the guilty party's identity and responsibility have been fully determined, traditional teaching does not exclude recourse to the death penalty, if this is the only possible way of effectively defending human lives against the unjust aggressor.\n\nIf, however, non-lethal means are sufficient to defend and protect people's safety from the aggressor, authority will limit itself to such means, as these are more in keeping with the concrete conditions of the common good and are more in conformity to the dignity of the human person. \n\nToday, in fact, as a consequence of the possibilities which the state has for effectively preventing crime, by rendering one who has committed an offense incapable of doing harm - without definitely taking away from him the possibility of redeeming himself - the cases in which the execution of the offender is an absolute necessity are very rare, if not practically non-existent.

What is the average price of a good engagement ring? . I've heard answers that range from $2,000 to $15,000. . Don't go by anybody else's formula about how much you should spend--especially the jewelry industry and their bogus 2-month's-salary story.  Decide how much you're comfortable spending, considering what else you could do with the money by saving it for your future together.  Then find a ring that matches your budget.  Don't let salesmen talk you into spending more; you're the one who knows your budget.\n\nIf you're worried that your fiancee won't be sufficiently impressed with the ring you choose, you could explain that you saved money on the ring by putting aside some money for a down payment on the house you'll buy together (or something else she feels is important).\n\nAnother cost saving strategy is to buy a ring with lots of small diamonds rather than one big one.  Diamonds cost MUCH less that way, and it still looks nice because you have lots of sparkly diamonds!	Family & Relationships

It's a novel approach to research but then, so was the Internet 10 or 12 years ago.

European television? . I noticed that in England and France shows come on at weird times, like 20:25, 21:55, 16:50, etc. Since shows there sometimes don't start on the hour or half hour like they do in the U.S. does that mean if a program starts at 20:40 on a French station does that mean all the other French stations will have a programme that starts at 20:40? To me not starting a show at :00 or :30 seems hard to schedule. . In the UK, channels like channel 4 often do this as they include short 5 minute programmes at times in their scheduling (things like viewer voxpops, short animations etc) - but the other channels don't follow suit and you normally still have something starting on the hour or half hour. The BBC use their weather bulletins to make up any time problems with scheduling, they'll be very short or very long if something in the timing has gone wrong and they need to make up or waste a bit of time.

What should I do with my 16-years old son he has lack of confidence? .  . 16 was a turning point for me.  I was skinny, weak, afraid of girls and even sucked in school.  At 15 I got into martial arts because I was sick of being bullied.  It was the single most significant influence in my teenage life.  After a year of that, I felt much more confident, bullies left me alone and I got my first girl friend.  The physical exercise made me stronger and helped my mind get clear.  The discipline put my behavior in line.  If such a thing would have been push upon me by my parents I would have rebelled, but coming from my Sensei a 5th degree black belt, I respected him and I wanted to be like him.  He was / is a man of great inner strength and integrity.    \n\nI think all teenagers go through a period of doubting their abilities, worth and place in the world.  It is part of their stretching out into the world.  Around 16 is when boys really start to separate away from their parents (for girls it seems to be around 14).  This is REALLY scary for them, and yet something they must do to grow up to a young adult.  The best thing to do is to let him know that you are there for him and you support him.  The reality is that his peers will have much more influence on him at this age than you will.	Health

So it means that this KALYUG will last atleast minimum 4 Million more years from now on. And the Hindu religious books say that after that, God will take rebirth in the form a Horse riding warrior name KALKI who will destroy all the evil, badness, and sorrow and restore truth, honesty and the whole world will turn into a paradise.

How many planets are there today? .  . HOW MANY ARE KNOWN AT THE MOMENT?:\n\n8 in our solar system + 3 dwarf planets\n\n(Planets: Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus & Neptune) (Dwarf Planets: 1 Ceres, 134340 Pluto, 136199 Eris)\n\nAND IN THE MILKY WAY GALAXY?\n\nSince pulsar planets were discovered in 1992 and 51 Pegasi b was discovered in 1995 we now know a total of 209 orbiting other stars:\n\nDetected by radial velocity method: 169 planetary systems, 197 planets, 20 multiple planet systems. \n\nDetected by microlensing: 4 planets. \n\nDetected by direct imaging: 4 planets. \n\nPulsar planets: 2 planetary systems, 4 planets, 1 multiple planet system. \n\nSee the full list in the Encyclopaedia of Exoplanets (third link) published and maintained by the Paris Observatory. Appropriately as it was the work of Urbain LeVerrier at that observatory that led to the discovery of Neptune in 1846.\n\nWHAT OF THE FUTURE?\n\nImproved detection rates can be expected in the coming years. Principally from CoRoT and the Kepler Mission: which being space-based will avoid the problems the earth's atmosphere creates for ground-based telescopes,\n\nCOROT:\n\nOn 15th November 2006 the CoRoT spacecraft arrived at the Baikonour launch base,\n\nCOROT (COnvection ROtation and planetary Transits) is a space mission approved and led by the French Space Agency (CNES) in conjunction with the European Space Agency and other international partners. The primary objective of COROT will be to search for extrasolar planets, particularly those of large terrestrial size. It is scheduled for launch on December 22, 2006, and will be the first mission of its kind.\n\nCOROT consists of a 27 cm in diameter afocal telescope with an array of spectroscopic detectors. The satellite has a launch mass of 630 kg, is 4.10 metres long, 1.984 metres in diameter and powered by two solar panels. \n\nA Russian rocket will lift the satellite into a circular polar orbit with an altitude of 827 km. Over its planned 2Â½ years mission it will observe perpendicular to its orbital plane meaning there will be no Earth occultations, allowing 150 days of continuous observing. During the northern Summer it will observe in an area around Serpens Cauda and during the Winter it will observe in Monoceros. Between this observing periods for 30 days, COROT will observe 5 other patches of the sky.\n\nThe probe will monitor the brightness of stars, watching for the slight dimming that happens in regular intervals when planets transit their primary. COROT will be sensitive enough to detect rocky planets, though only those several times larger than Earth; it is also expected to discover new gas giants, which comprise almost all of the known extrasolar planets.\n\nCOROT will also undertake asteroseismology. It can detect luminosity variations associated with acoustic pulsations of stars. This phenomenon allows calculation of a star's precise mass, age and chemical composition and will aid in comparisons between the sun and other stars.\n\nIn each field of view there will be one main target star for the asteroseismology as well as up to nine other targets. Simultaneously, it will be recording the brightness of 12,000 stars brighter than apparent magnitude 15.5 for the extrasolar planet study. It is expected that a few dozen planets will be found.\n\nTHE KEPLER MISSION\n\nThe scientific objective of the Kepler Mission, due for launch in 2008, is to explore the structure and diversity of planetary systems. This is achieved by surveying a large sample of stars to achieve several goals:\n\nDetermine how many terrestrial and larger planets there are in or near the habitable zone of a wide variety of spectral types of stars \n\nDetermine the range of sizes and shapes of the orbits of these planets \n\nEstimate how many planets there are in multiple-star systems \n\nDetermine the range of orbit size, brightness, size, mass and density of short-period giant planets \n\nIdentify additional members of each discovered planetar	Science & Mathematics
any tricks that make multipling fractions REALLY easy? .  . You can cross-cancel, and then multiply ... at least I think that's what it's called. \n\nLet's say you have the problem 27/4 x 16/9. Looks somewhat large at first, but you can make it really simple. The 9 and 27 can be reduced, because 9 is a factor of both of those numbers. Take 9 out of each and you get 3/4 x 16/1. Then you can take 4 out of the 16 and the 4. You're left with the problem 3/1 x 4/1, which equals 12/1. That reduces to 12.\n\nA long-looking problem that can be easily simplified. Hope that helps.

footballers? . how to be a great goalkeeper . First, go jogging around a big stadium for one time. Then, increase it to 2 to 3 times. Try increasing it to more times as you go on. This is because jogging helps a lot in building your alertness. You need to be really alert to become a very good goalkeeper. \n\nSecond, try asking a friend to kick the ball really hard and try to save it. Also, try turning your back towards your friend and when your friend shouts (when he shouts, a second or two after that, he must shoot), jump back into the normal position and try to catch the ball. Its really hard but practice makes perfect.\n\nThird, eat healthy food and try having a stable diet so that you grow tall. Your height could really help you if you want to save super accurate free-kicks.	Sports

Girl problems and jealousy... Help!? . Anyways my girl friend is really really really jealous! I dunno why?! I thought that was something you went threw when you were a kid. Then I thought maybe it was just end after a little while. But no shes still extreamly jealous! We live together, I am 17 and shes 18, she lives with me and I'm with her all the time but I dunno she would be so jealous! She also gets mad and says I dont care because I dont get jealous, I just dont have a jealous feeling! Its wierd why she feels like this. Why is she so jealous? Im with her almost all the time! I dont talk to any girls at all. What do you think I should do? Why does she act like this? . It just happens with girls, especially young ones. They feel the need to compete with other girls. She probably thinks you are a lot prettier than her or something makes her think she is below you. This may or may not actually be the case, but it is going to happen anyway because of her probable lack of self esteem. The best thing to do is to show her that you don't want to compete. Show her that you love her as a friend, and compliment her often. She is probably insecure and she needs to know that she has good qualities just like everyone else.	Society & Culture

RAID is a system used in computers involving how the hard drive is used. It stands for Redundant Array of Independent Disks. There are different types, from RAID 0 to RAID 100 (10 + 0) that each mean slightly different things. Incase you care though, RAID 0 is striping your data across two hard drives so that its much faster to access your data, but also riskier. RAID 1 is Mirroring, which is just having two disks of the same thing for security reasons.\n\nBasically, if you don't know what it is you don't need it.\n\nAs for third party drivers, it could mean anything, but it usually refers to video card/sound card/keyboard/mouse drivers. When Windows asks it probably means installing it from a disk that came with it, which it pointless because you can just install it once Windows is done installing.	Computers & Internet

"How are diamonds rated? . what are the characteristics of high quality diamonds and where are the best diamonds mined? . The rating for selection of good diamonds and proper pricing is based on 4 (Four) ""Cs"" 0- Carat, Clarity,  Color, Cut. The significance of these qualities are-\n\nThe carat weight measures the mass of a diamond. One carat is defined as a fifth of a gram, or exactly 200 milligrams (about 0.007 ounce). The point unitâequal to one one-hundredth of a carat (0.01 carat, or 2 mg)âis commonly used for diamonds of less than one carat. All else being equal, the value of a diamond increases exponentially in relation to carat weight, since larger diamonds are both rarer and more desirable for use as gemstones. A review of comparable diamonds available for purchase in September 2005 demonstrates this effect \n\nClarity is a measure of internal defects of a diamond called inclusions. Inclusions may be crystals of a foreign material or another diamond crystal, or structural imperfections such as tiny cracks that can appear whitish or cloudy. The number, size, color, relative location, orientation, and visibility of inclusions can all affect the relative clarity of a diamond. The Gemological Institute of America (GIA) and others have developed systems to grade clarity, which are generally based on those inclusions which are visible to a trained professional when a diamond is viewed from above, under 10x magnification.\n\nA chemically pure and structurally perfect diamond is perfectly transparent with no hue, or color. However, in reality almost no gem-sized natural diamonds are absolutely perfect. The color of a diamond may be affected by chemical impurities and/or structural defects in the crystal lattice. Depending on the hue and intensity of a diamond's coloration, a diamond's color can either detract from or enhance its value. For example, most white diamonds are discounted in price as more yellow hue is detectable, while intense pink or blue diamonds (such as the Hope Diamond) can be dramatically more valuable.\n\nDiamond cutting is the art and science of creating a gem-quality diamond out of mined rough. The cut of a diamond describes the manner in which a diamond has been shaped and polished from its beginning form as a rough stone to its final gem proportions. The cut of a diamond describes the quality of workmanship and the angles to which a diamond is cut. Often diamond cut is confused with ""shape.""\n\nBased on all the above quallity and price will be determined-"	Science & Mathematics

What is epistasis? plz explain it with examples clearly? . Nothing . Epistasis refers to the phenomenon where one or more genes will mask the effects of another gene in a different position on a chromosome (or locus). This shouldn't be confused with dominance though where the interaction takes place in the same locus.\n\nSimple Example: The gene that causes Albinism hides the gene controlling the color of a person's hair.\n\nAnother Example: Bombay Phenotype - This involves the ABO Blood group system. They lack a protein called the H antigen which is used to form the A and B antigens. So even though they may have A or B genes, they appear to be blood group O because of the lack of H antigens.

We both believe in God and go to church, but he wants to fornicate so because I love him I fornicate with him but don't enjoy it because I know it is wrong.

I don't want to break up with him but I need some help with this, I really believe our relationship can escalate into marriage. . My opinion about your situation is...\n\nIN God's eyes you are already married by virtue of having fornicated.  Thus, if you  make it legal by civil marriage, then in the eyes of God, technically you are fine.\n\nYou have already asked forgiveness, and God does forgive.\n\nIf you saved yourself for your boyfriend, and you have been with no other person, and in love you have fornicated, as you say, then you ARE married, by God's definition.\n\nNow, in the eyes of the ""law"" you are not married, but that can be solved once you give yourselves to eachother legally on paper.\n\nOf course, I don't know your age, and this advice is given with the understanding that you are of age.  Else, I would advise against such activity, until you are an adult.\n\nOf course, you already feel guilty and are giving in to his desires.  Yours may not be as strong, or might be once the guilt is removed by virtue of marriage.  ON the other hand , he should respect your wishes to be chaste, until you are married.  That will truly determine his love for you. This is a hard thing, because you love him, and the unknown is whether he would wait and also be faithful in the process.  \n\nI hope it works out for you.."	Society & Culture

Communism:\nPROs:  Proclaims equal distribution of goods amongst all men\nCONs:  Humanity---men will become lazy if they do not have to work for things and the redistribution of goods is pu in the hand of a governemnt that will inevitably become corrupt.\n\nFascism:\nPros:  An absolute authority with far-sweeping powers and control of most major arenas of commerce can bring a nation back to its feet and keep an economy rolling along smoothly.\nCons:  Humanity--as George Orwell said:  Absolute power corrupts absolutely.\nCapitalism:\nPros:  Minimal governemnt intrusion into the public arena.  Businesses can operate freely and, theoretically, people are more mobile in the social hierarchy.\nCons:  Humanity---in the above two instances it was the corruption of the governemnt, but now it is the corruption and possible cold-heartedness of the capitalists.

Speed of heating up water? . I have heard people tell me this.  Cold water boils faster than hot water.  Is this an urban legend?  Does water really reach its boiling point faster when started at a colder temperature? . Heat = mass x specific heat of material x change of temperature.\nSpecific heat of water is 1. So the amount of heat needed to be added is the mass of the water x the amount of change needed to get to boiling. So cold water does not boil faster. \n\nsalt will cause it to take longer. \n\nPeople think that tea tastes betterr if you start with cold water, which holds more oxygen. As you heat the water, the oxygen comes out. This may look like boiling.	Science & Mathematics

is he seeing another woman? . me and my bf are living together. i do everything i can to make him happy, but he doesn't seem to feel content with anything.\nmoreover, for a month or so he has always been telling me that is tired, or has a lot to work... when it comes to have sex.\nshould i believe him and support him more or should i think that there is another woman in his life?\nmy friends are telling me that, but i've never wanted to believe them, but him.\nwhat do you think about this? . Dear. The last thing that should come to your mind should be thinking so negatively like that. Men seem to be tired of Sex too. Believe me. It takes time but the good times will come back. Try to make him happy and get him more excited by wearing things that he likes. I think you should not doubt his love to you only because he has less sex with you. There is a lot of difference between love and sex. Women seem to get worried if their partner doesn't sleep with them frequently. Men start very fast and then they slow down.\n\nOne last thing I added later:\n\nStay away from negative women's advise. As someone here said Men Hater women who had bad experiences with the opposite sex, try to make their friends to suffer like themselves. This is the same with them men who dislike females. Stay away from advices of people like Sunbeam. These people are miserable and see the world differently. Think wisely and solve your problem with him gradually.

Emily, first before you can do anything about changing the way you feel you need to find out why he stopped wanting to have sex with you. Sometimes men see us as Mothers instead of a wife when we are pregnant and that stops them, when they are like it this it does break that bond as wife and husband. If he is cheating then you need to find out why he has done this to you and his daughter. Talk with him and not in a accusing way but just tell him how your feeling and that you want to get close to him again. I have no idea why a man would do this."	Family & Relationships

do you understand this from the author of the da vinci code? . Dan Brown talks about the controversy surrounding the movie.\n\nHOW MUCH OF THIS NOVEL IS TRUE?\nThe Da Vinci Code is a novel and therefore a work of fiction. While the book's characters and their actions are obviously not real, the artwork, architecture, documents, and secret rituals depicted in this novel all exist (for example, Leonardo Da Vinci's paintings, the Gnostic Gospels, Hieros Gamos, etc.). These real elements are interpreted and debated by fictional characters. While it is my belief that some of the theories discussed by these characters may have merit, each individual reader must explore these characters' viewpoints and come to his or her own interpretations. My hope in writing this novel was that the story would serve as a catalyst and a springboard for people to discuss the important topics of faith, religion, and history. . Paraphrased, it says:\n\nI've taken some historical figures, and I've distorted and manipulated them into a fictional tale...I have no problem with the way I misrepresented Jesus Christ and His devoted followers, because I simply hope to make a lot of money.

Explain the uselfulness of measuring the physical properties of a substance? . Such as: melting point, boiling point, density, solubility..... . There are several uses for this.  Generally for chemistry students the effort teaches them how the measurements are made, good laboratory techniques, and hopefully, some insight into chemistry and the physical sciences.  It doesn't always work, but it makes a good experiment. \n\nFor those who are in the business of using various substances, it is very important to know what their physical properties are, and how they relate to the physical properties of other substances.  Your air conditioner was designed around those measurements, as was your car, paint, furnace, and just about everything that was manufactured around you.  \n\nWhile nature obviously doesn't carefully record properties in a lab book, they are important to how plants and animals work, how hard rocks are, how ice forms, etc.  Without understanding these properties, we can't understand nature or ourselves completely.

What would be the proportion of Carbon 14, compared to that in a living tree, that you would find in this piece of wood? . Carbon 14 has a half life between 5700 and 5730 years.\n\nSo if you have 100 unit, in 5730 years you would then have 50 units, in another 5700 years you would have 25 units.\n\nIn yourcase, your tree is 11,000 years old. So the original proportion would be 100% and in 11,000 years it would halve once and nearly a second time, so you would be left with about 28% or roughly 1/4 like the first answer said.\n\nhttp://hypertextbook.com/facts/1997/MargaretKong.shtml	Science & Mathematics

can you tell me exactly what a tight end in football is supposed to do.? . My friends are saying that with my build and speed i should try out for that position. I'm bearly starting to watch football and loving it. Can anyone outthere tell me. . The complete tight end has many different various abilities/skillls.\n\nFirst of all, he should be agile.  This allows him to juke people out, get more yards on a reception, and create space by fooling the people covering him.\n\nAlso, he should have speed.  By having speed, he can run and blow past defenders.  Though (Like agility), a tight end is normally not as fast or agile as wide receivers, he should still be fast.\n\nBesides that, he should have power.  The power allows him to knock people down when blocking, break tackles, and push himself for those few extra yards.\n\nA huge trait is blocking.  In the run game, the tight end is like a 6th offensive lineman, but he can get out more and not be called for an illegal man downfield penalty.  In the passing game, he might be called as an extra blocker against the blitz, so the qb doesn't get sacked.\n\n\nAll in all, a tight end is supposed to do many various things.  He should be able to block in both the passing and running game, create separation from the person covering him in the passing game, have good awareness for when he is blocking, and be able to power past people when necessary.

You could live in one of the ""outer"" boroughs--Queens or Brooklyn--where apartments are a little less expensive and where there are subways to take you into Manhattan.

Most whitening toothpastes don't work andt he ones that do work...they take too long to make a difference.  Cosmetic whitening can be expensive.  Chrest whitestips WORK!  After using them about two times, you can tell a difference.  They are kind of expensive...about $25-$35 depending on which kind you get, but they both work great.  If money is your concern, try the less expensive one.  It's kind of weird at first to feel something stuck to your teeth for 30 minutes.  And I suggest that when you take them off you have the toothbrush with toothpaste ready.  Don't lick your teeth after you take the strips off cuz the gel is NASTY!

"Anyone remember a cartoon called ""The Mutant League""?  It rocked!? .  . yup watch it. its nice and i think it rocked 2....\nlemme give u a short description.\nMutant League was a cartoon series based on Mutant League Football and Mutant League Hockey by Electronic Arts.\n\nDuring a football game an earthquake reveals buried toxic waste, and the fumes cause all of the atendees and players to mutate, incluing young Bones Justice (cf. Bones Jackson in the games). A sports federation based around the superhuman beings, the Mutant League, springs up, and Bones grows up to play for the Midway Monsters. Corrupt league commissioner Zalgor Prig constantly schemes to get the popular athlete to play for the team he owns, the Slaycity Slayers, or if nothing else discredit him for refusing to join the Slayers. Bones' search for his father, missing since the day of the quake, and his personal quest to bring order and fairplay to the league, are subplots throughout the series. Several other characters from the games such as Razor Kid, Mo and Spew, K.T. Slayer, Grim McSlam and Coach McWimple regularly appear in the show.\n\nUnlike the games, players didn't die from their unique approach to contact sports; though frequently maimed to the point of losing bodyparts, through treatments in a machine called the Rejuventaor which bathed them in toxic chemicals, they would soon be as good as new. The show also has no robot players, and only five teams: the Monsters, the Slayers, the Ooze, the Derangers and the Screaming Evils. It also has the teams competing in all manner of sports, not just the ones seen in the games. Most commonly football, but also hockey, basketball, soccer, baseball and even monster truck races and sumo wrestling. Some episodes end with a ""grudge match"" between two particular players.\n\nThe show ran for two seasons, with the second typically incorporating more poignant stories and issues, while the first seemed somewhat hodgepodge with little regard for continuity (the Monsters have one win streak that ends twice, for instance)."

"When will our government admit it possesses ""zero point energy"" technology, which is clean, free, energy? . <www.disclosureproject.org> alleges that our military industrial complex has reverse engineered, in covert military projects, extra-terrestrial power systems which could easily solve our energy ""crisis.""  The upshot is that the last 50+ years of oil and nuclear pollution has been unecessary, because we've secretly possessed this technology since the 1950's or so.  The Disclosure Project has 400+ witnesses willing to testify against the government in Congressional Hearings, but the political will-power does not yet exist because no one will take this topic seriously, and certainly not the US mainstream media!  A 19th century physicist, Nikola Tesla, also made similar discoveries about energy -- and his research is also heavily suppressed because if everyone could run their house, or car, or business from a zero point energy generator then the power companies couldn't hook a meter up to it and charge you for the service.  A 1st world standard of living could be sustainable with ZPE. . If you think about the properties of electromagnetism and electricity itself, and you study up on Teslas ideas, it seems as if there is a whole new area of science waiting to be seen by the mainstream. It is not complicated at all and should be looked into."	Politics & Government
How do you overcome your fear of going to a counsellor face to face? . I know I need to because of the abuse and the suicidal thoughts and everything. However I have this fear holding me back and I don't know how to overcome it. I just feel completely lost and tired of all this. I have been on Prozac for 8 weeks and it doesn't work. I would very much like to just drink and drink and drink until......well you know. I know it sounds crazy and irrational but this is how I feel. . I think that after you get to your first appointment you'll stop being afraid of it, cause a big part of a therapist's job is making sure their patient is comfortable talking to them, so it's probably just a matter of getting to that point.  Who prescribed the Prozac?  In order to get a prescription for that you must have talked to a doctor about your depression, so whoever you talked to then you should maybe talk to again, and have them help you find a counsellor and make an appointment.  Once you have an appointment, just show up, no matter how nervous you are, and the counsellor will take it from there.\n\nBTW, if you didn't see my comment to your question about your online counsellor coming on to you, you should report him to the relevent licensing board. If you've saved any chats/emails that he says things that are clearly sexual advances he could (and should) lose his license for it.	Health

"Whay is a ""colony""? Which country remain as colony today? . Based on the United Nations, this country (a commonwealth) is the only colonty remian in the americas. . In politics and in history, a colony is a territory under the immediate political control of a geographically-distant state. For colonies in antiquity, city-states would often found their own colonies. Some colonies were historically separate countries, while others were territories without definite statehood at the moment of colonization. The metropolitan state is the state that owns the colony. In Ancient Greece, the city that owned a colony was called the metropolis within its political organization. Mother country is the term used to refer to the metropolitan state by its citizens that live in a colony. Today, the terms overseas territory or dependent territory are preferred. There is a United Nations list of Non-Self-Governing Territories.\n\nPeople who migrated to settle permanently in colonies controlled by their country of origin were called colonists or settlers.\n\nA colony differs from a puppet state or satellite state in that a colony has no independent international representation and the top-level administration of a colony is under direct control of the metropolitan state.\n\nThe term ""informal colony"" is used by some historians to describe a country which is under the de facto control of another state, although this description is often contentious.\n\nhope this helps. for more go:"	Politics & Government
I'm a gay Blk male Who wants to have an interracial baby,  am I selfish and illogical? . Since i was 15, i've wanted to be a father. I knew i was different (gay) but was told it was just a phase. I figured the phase would have ended by 25, Iwould have meet someone by 30 and have started a family by 35. Here i am at 37 and the phase hasn't stopped, neither has the desire to father a child. I've been a nanny and baby sitter for many years to practice, everyone say's i'm great with kids. I just don't know if i am trying to make up for the loneliness in a life i didn't think would have lasted this long. I feel in my heart i want to be a father of an interracial child. the child would be beautiful no matter what but the mix of two cultures i feel would make it really special. I hope this not some selffish void in myself i'm trying to fill. . I only have 2 concerns: 1-is that you're single and raising a child on your own can be very challenging and 2-where do you live? You have to put your own experiences aside & think about the child's. Will they be harassed or exposed to possible violence because of your situation? I live in L.A. so luckily people are very open to different types of families but if you lived in the south for example, I would think twice. Being a mixed child with a single gay father could cause serious reactions and affect the child's self-image.\n\nBottom line, make the decision from your heart and be sure that you can give the child everything it needs before exposing it to this mean & intolerable world.

"Development in the industry points towards black box components develpment y?? plzz help in this question? .  . Black box components are a likely candidate because they effectively abstract the functionality to a known user interface.

Has anyone been to the Jesuit church in Kutna Hora?  It's lined with the bones of 40k people? .  . Kostnice looks like most other Gothic churches. But from the moment you enter the front door, you know that this is no ordinary church -- all of the decorations are made from human bones. No kidding. Frantisek Rint, the church's interior decorator, created crosses of bone, columns of bone, chalices of bone, and even a coat of arms in bone for the Schwarzenberg family, who owned the church.\n\nThe obvious questions are: Where did the bones come from, and why were they used for decorations? The first question is easier to answer: The bones came from victims of the 14th-century plague and the 15th-century Hussite wars; both events left thousands dead, who were buried in mass graves on the church's site. As the area developed, the bones were uncovered, and the local monks came up with this idea of how to put the bones to use.	Society & Culture

I find that i like doing like three or four different machines on cardio day to mix it up, it helps the time pass faster.\n*Music is great during cardio, it helps the time pass, and it makes it fun*\n\nAfter your cardio workout it would be good to stretch for about 5-10 min while your muscles are warmed up-but don't overdo it.\n\n\nDAY THREE- same as day one\nDAY FOUR-same as day two\nBasically just keep switching off days, and then take the seventh day off.  Your body will need that rest period especially in the begging.

"wt came 1st-""hen or egg??????????????""? . how can u say that? . This question appears regularly in the question file, so let's take a shot at it. \n\nIn nature, living things evolve through changes in their DNA. In an animal like a chicken, DNA from a male sperm cell and a female ovum meet and combine to form a zygote -- the first cell of a new baby chicken. This first cell divides innumerable times to form all of the cells of the complete animal. In any animal, every cell contains exactly the same DNA, and that DNA comes from the zygote. \n\nChickens evolved from non-chickens through small changes caused by the mixing of male and female DNA or by mutations to the DNA that produced the zygote. These changes and mutations only have an effect at the point where a new zygote is created. That is, two non-chickens mated and the DNA in their new zygote contained the mutation(s) that produced the first true chicken. That one zygote cell divided to produce the first true chicken. \n\nPrior to that first true chicken zygote, there were only non-chickens. The zygote cell is the only place where DNA mutations could produce a new animal, and the zygote cell is housed in the chicken's egg. So, the egg must have come first."	Entertainment & Music

If a tesseract is a 4 dimesional figure then is there a wayto fold the universe or part of it up? . give opinions or watever.  aslo would that mean traveling back in time?  The fourth dimesion is time so....  by the way im only 12 years old. . Mass (or rather gravity) bends space, as has been proved sometime ago = it works in this way - Imagine a water bed representing space. If you place a heavy canon ball on the water bed, the bed would have an indentation where the canon ball was placed. The area surrounding the canon ball would also be warped towards the canon ball. So if you placed a tennis ball on the bed near the canon ball, the tennis ball would roll downwards and lie touching the canonball. Similarly, huge masses such as the sun, do bend space.\n\nThis is one of examples associated with proving the existence of black holes too.	Science & Mathematics
So Jesus died for the sins of mankind? . Now, Chrstians say Adam, because he sinned was punished by God by being banished to earth with Eve, & would now experience death. As would all sinners. The case being if you sinned, you die. So, if Jesus died for all mankinds sins, then how come nobody lives forever? . The problem with Muslims is that you hold to the word of one prophet and ignore the rest. Great prophets in the Old Testament prophesied many times of the coming King and how He would suffer to heal His people. I judge a prophet by his message. That message has to be consistent with all the previous messages from God. Mohammad's message is out of sync. It doesn't teach that blood must be shed to gain forgiveness of sin as both the Old and the New Testaments do. You deny Christ's position. Out of His own mouth He claimed to be the I AM God that spoke to Moses from the burning bush. Adam and Eve Died the day they sinned. They lost the presence of God in their lives and physical death followed. Now God is restored in the Lives of the Christian Gos walk with us in our daily walk before Him. We are alive Spiritually again. We still carry with us the body of sin that is subject to physical death. When it is gone our spirits go to the Father who created them and so we are ever with the Lord. I don't know as you can understand the two deaths physical and spiritual because I don't know your teaching that well. All I need to know about Islam is that you deny that Jesus is God. That tells me that your religion is closer to a cult than it is to God...   Jim	Society & Culture

possible employment opportunity for physics electronist? .  . Electronic technicians (2 year Associates degree at a community college) and Electrical/Electronic Engineers (4 year Bachelor of Science in Electrical Engineering) both typically take several courses in physics as part of their degree curriculums. Mathematics and physics are the fundamental courses in science that underlie degrees in electrical/electronic engineering. Many times young students start out with an interest in radio, computers or other electronics related hobbies and then naturally take courses in physics and mathematics that help them understand how electrical things work. Don't worry too much if you don't do too well in math now, but you will have to get extra tutoring to help you with math if you want to get either an associates or bachelor's degree in electronics or electrical engineering.

C++ question about char variables? . I want to limit a user's input of a char variable to a length of 1. So if they input 'aaa', I want to cut it to just the first 'a'. I cannot use string for this example. An easier application would be to know how I can find the length of a char variable, then I can set a condition: if char length > 1 then re-input from user. Does .length() work for char? Or is there something else? . To use the input the way you want... you have know how the c compiler gets the input... all output and input are first transferred from the i&#92;o device to a stream...so the input is  stored in a stream and the program gets its input from this stream...so if the user gives two chars as input... its stored in the stream... and after the program gets a char from the stream...the next char which is in the stream is taken as the next input... to avoid this you can use the function fflush();... this funtion erases the stream...

Du u think the mexicans should stay or go? . me I think the should stay to have the jobs no other peeps want lik washin dishes n pickin veg. . My family moved to the US before WWII. Those of my family that didn't make it over got killed by the death camps. Our family assimilated to the American culture. We didn't expect the Americans to change to suit us. The illegal immigrants from Mexico are not civilized like that.\n\nThey not only changed the National Anthem to Spanish, they changed the words. They already burn our flag and hang our flag upside down. They waved the Mexican flag during a lot of their protests. Some schools have stopped hanging the American flag and forbidden students from wearing clothes with any part of the American flag on their clothing all to keep from offending the Mexicans. It's nothing short of an attack of our country, not only by the illegal aliens, but those who seek to appease them. \n\nI am tired of the stereotype that Americans wouldn't do the work that illegals do. Illegals do all kinds of jobs for less than minimum wage which drives the wages down for U.S. citizens. Construction jobs are an example. There are lots of illegals doing construction jobs that Americans used to do because the companies can keep more of the profits if they pay less for the workers. All that does is make companies wealthier and Americans poorer. Illegals are stealing jobs that Americans have done for years.	Politics & Government

The toal number of bonding electrons in a molecule of formaldehyde H2CO is? .  . okay, if we draw the basic structure of H2CO, we know that the Carbon is in the center. That's usually how it is.\nCarbon likes to have four bonds because of it's position on the periodic table.\n\nNow, first, let's count how many electrons are in the H2CO molecule.\nH=1, 2(1) =2\nC = 4\nO = 6\ntotal = 12\nSo let's draw carbon in the middle, bonded to H, H, and O\nH-C-H\n....O\n(That should be like a t-shape).\nSo far we've used 6 electrons (we have 3 bonds), so 12-6 leaves us with 6 electrons.\nlet's finish the carbon quartet, so now carbon has 3 bonds and one pair of electrons\n6-2=4 electrons left\nlet's put the four electrons around O....\nbut that only puts a total of 6 electrons on O (4 in lone pairs and 2 in bonds) and Oxygen wants to have a quartet.\n\nRemember that pair of electrons that we put on carbon?\nLet's make a double bond between O and C.\n\nso now the final diagram looks like\nH2-C=O\nand there are four (two pairs) of lone electrons on Oxygen\nSo to answer your question\nthere are two bonds to oxygen and two bonds to H, a total of four bonds.\n2(4)=8\nCarbon is using all 8 electrons to bond.

what are the various tests to determine whether something is a fixture or a chattel? . please help! law final! . Answers.com\nGives the following\n\nFixture\n\nAn article in the nature of personal property which has been so annexed to the realty that it is regarded as a part of the real property. That which is fixed or attached to something permanently as an appendage and is not removable.\n\nA thing is deemed to be affixed to real property when it is attached to it by roots, imbedded in it, permanently resting upon it, or permanently attached to what is thus permanent, as by means of cement, plaster, nails, bolts, or screws.\n\nGoods are fixtures when they become so related to particular real estate that an interest in them arises under real estate law, e.g. a furnace affixed to a house or other building, counters permanently affixed to the floor of a store, or a sprinkler system installed in a building.\n\nFixtures possess the attributes of both real and personal property.\n\nTypes\n\nFixtures are generally classified as agricultural, domestic, ornamental, or trade. Agricultural fixtures are articles that are annexed for the purpose of farming. Domestic and ornamental fixtures are objects that a tenant may attach to a unit in order to render it more habitable. Stoves, shelves, and lighting equipment are types of domestic fixtures. Ornamental fixtures include curtains, chimney grates, blinds, and beds fastened to walls.\n\nTrade fixtures are articles affixed to rented buildings by merchants, in order to pursue the business for which the premises are occupied. They encompass those items that merchants annex to the premises to facilitate the storage, handling, and display of their stock for sale to the publicâsuch as booths, bars, display cases and lightsâthat are usually removable without material damage to the premises. The objective of this rule is to promote trade and industry. A tenant, however, has no right to disengage a trade fixture if its detachment would cause substantial damage to the premises.\n\nRequirements\n\nThe article must be physically annexed to the realty or something appurtenant thereto in order for it to become a fixture. Annexation to land occurs when the object is permanently affixed to the property through the application of plaster, cement, bolts, screws, nuts, or nails.\n\nThe attached article must also be adapted to the intended use or purpose of the realty so that it effectively becomes inseparable from the land itself.\n\nThe intention of the person who attaches the article determines whether or not the article is a fixture. The individual is not required to verbalize the intent, although the courts will evaluate such expressions. The courts consider the tenant's intent, which is inferred from all of the facts and circumstances concerning the actual annexation of the object, such as the nature of the article affixed, the method of annexation, and the extent to which the object has been integrated into the real estate.\n\nAgreement of the Parties\n\nThe parties may enter into an agreement in regard to the nature of an item to be utilized with realty. Statutes confer this right in some jurisdictions, and these agreements are enforceable whenever the rights of third persons are not violated.\n\nThe terms of a lease often define the rights of a landlord and tenant in regard to fixtures. If the lease unequivocally stipulates that the tenant has the right to remove particular articles, the fact that the removal will damage the rented premises is immaterial.\n\nFixtures are usually attached to rented premises for the tenant's benefit without any intention of increasing the value of the landlord's property. Generally when no agreement exists between the parties, articles annexed by the tenant may be detached by the tenant, during the term of the tenancy, provided such can be done without damaging the premises.\n\nThe law favors the tenant's position that certain articles should be regarded as personal property rather than as part of the realty. Such improvements are those made to the rented prem	Politics & Government

How do I fold a US flag? . I need to fold a flag for my father's funeral. He was a navy vet. . Special care should be taken that no part of the flag touches the ground. The Flag is then carefully folded into the shape of a tri-cornered hat, emblematic of the hats worn by colonial soldiers during the war for Independence. In the folding, the red and white stripes are finally wrapped into the blue, as the light of day vanishes into the darkness of night. \n\n\nThis custom of special folding is reserved for the United States Flag alone. \n\nHow to fold the Flag\n\nStep 1\n\n\nTo properly fold the Flag, begin by holding it waist-high with another person so that its surface is parallel to the ground.\n\n\n\n\n\nStep 2\n\n\nFold the lower half of the stripe section lengthwise over the field of stars, holding the bottom and top edges securely.\n\n\n\n\n\nStep 3\n\n\nFold the flag again lengthwise with the blue field on the outside.\n\n\n\n\n\nStep 4\n\n\nMake a triangular fold by bringing the striped corner of the folded edge to meet the open (top) edge of the flag.\n\n\n\n\n\nStep 5\n\n\nTurn the outer (end) point inward, parallel to the open edge, to form a second triangle. \n\n\n\n\n\nStep 6\n\n\nThe triangular folding is continued until the entire length of the flag is folded in this manner. \n\n\n\n\nStep 7\n\n\nWhen the flag is completely folded, only a triangular blue field of stars should be visible.

compare the rates of diffusion...? . a. CO and N2\n\nb. NO2 and SO2 . In the absense of additional information or context the basis for this question rests in the size of the molecule. The smaller molecule will have a greater rate of diffusion than the larger molecule.  In general size of molecules is directly proportional to their molecular weight. When all molecules are the same molecular weight you will need to consider which ones are smaller based on the attractive forces between them. \n\na)  CO and N2 - N2 has a triple bond (the Ns are held closely to each other therefore small) and is very stable and I would bet that it will diffuse faster than CO since its actual size is smaller and because it is stable it is less likely to react with any medium through which it is diffusing.\nb) No2 and SO2 - this is likely to be based on size with the larger SO2 diffusing more slowly.\n\nHope this helps.

I was hurt, but it taught me that some people CAN'T be flexible on this issue.   Ironically, flexibility and good communication is what is called for in a situation like this.\n\nBest advice: you will have to come to some sort of terms with each other on this.  Either agree to keep an open mind, agree to disagree in a friendly manner, or agree that disucssion of religion can/will be touchy and the topic should be avoided.  And a little study of what the other person's religion is about is a good idea too!"	Family & Relationships

In favor:\n\n(1) It is a humane and compassionate thing to do, especially with undocumented workers who have been here for a long time, and have therefore taken roots here.  (It also helps to eschew the problem of separating families because some of the members are here illegally and some are not.)\n\n(2) It is a way to obtain some revenue: e.g., one could legalize an undocumented worker and make him or her pay--over the years, and in small amounts--the tributary debt he or she owes to the IRS, for all the years spent in the US illegally.\n\n(3) It keeps in line with America's historical openness to immigrants and refugees.\n\nAgainst:\n\n(1) It may encourage more illegal immigrants to come here.  This is a serious problem, and so amnesty should only be given if coupled with a substantial increase of border security, and a toughening of the regime of deportations, perhaps even with the criminalization of illegal trespassing.\n\n(2) It will infuriate simpletons in both parties, particularly in the Republican right-wing.\n\n(3) It will produce a block of future values-voters.

If animals suddenly gained alot of intellligence, would they be able to overcome the human race? . Explain. . Let's define what is the significance that you attribute to the term overcome.\n- Scientific achievements or\n- Social cohesion?\nAt this point, I aggree with Dogma ; intelligence alone might not be enough. \nBut I think that they have a lot of probabilities, because their instincts are conducting them to gather in groups,and accept their leader. They are not ambitious, they are happy having simple things. I would say that they don't want to reach the top in the Maslow's pyramide. \nIf social cohesion is assured, scientific achievements will come.\nThis means that they are able to overcome the human race.\nBut...don't worry1 This will never happen. Animals are clever enough in order not to show it to us!\n\nKaterina	Business & Finance

It may be hard for him.  Don't get too upset, after a year's relationship that is probaby a very uncomfortable situation for him.  He is right to tell you not to spoil your life because of him.

Sounds like he is a nice guy and things just didn't work out.  I would move on.	Family & Relationships

Why does coal give off so much energy? GOOD ANSWERS PLEASEâ¥? .  . Coal is actually very inefficient as an energy source.  One ton (2000 lbs or 1000 kg +/-) of coal produces the same amount of heat energy as 18,000 cubic feet of natural gas, 160 gallons (1100 lbs) of oil, or 5 ounces of uranium.

"Will fundamentalist religious people ever get sick of using the same boring answers to explain everything? . Will they finally snap out of the ""broken record"" phase and start thinking outside their religious boxes? I mean it's fine if they believe God exists and Jesus died because people are a**es but do they have to go on about it over every little thing? Jesus this, God that, Allah here, Mohammod there. It's so mundane. \n\nI would compare it to watching the same re-run on tv over and over again every single day with the same ignorant enthusiasm every time and then running around telling people about that very same re-run at every chance they get. \n\nI wonder if any of them stop and think about that at all? Maybe just once out of 500,000 days they go ""I've heard this part already, God I'm getting bored with this religion crap"". What do you think? . Once upon the time I too was quite belligerent about religion, that is until I discovered philosophy.  From my studies I realized all knowledge has Faith as a base. For science to work one MUST except the universe is organized, understandable and that man is capable of understanding it. Those, my friend, are assumtions, not facts, and unless you except them there is no scientific method to be had.\n\nMy advice, cut the religious group some slack.

Why isn't Africa and other poor countries using those same tactics for our help? . They have poor (very poor) . They have bad government. They want a better life. Is this America's fault too?

Isn't it time for them to give their problems to us?\nWe want to be fair to all. What do we expect them to do? . Because it is a lot harder for Africans to get here since they have an ocean to swim across, not just a river and a border to jump on foot.  Also, they are truly more poor than Mexicans and Central Americans, so they don't have any money to even attempt to cross over illegally, whereas the Mexicans and Central Americans do, even the poor ones can scrape a few pesos and limperas together to buy food and bribes on their way up.

How do I get over a boyfriend? . We have been together for 5 years, 3 1/2 of those living together. We seperated this summer and I am trying to sell my house and move away.

If this relationship was a long one it can be particularly hard to overcome. My advice to you is when we walk the path of life with another very often when they leave a huge hole is left in our lives. I would suggest you allow that hole in your life to heal rather than try to force someone else in what is and will become a poorly fitting gap. Lots of people make this mistake and compound often minor mistakes in doing so. This can lead to tragedy and heartache for both parties involved.

"Is anyone afraid of marriage these days? . with a high percentage of divorce and cheating? Even in the churches? . I understand. I donât know what Iâd do if I wasnât married, but let me share some of the things I have learned in almost 20 years:\n\n1) Courtship is important. And long courtships are best. In our fast-paced world, especially as young adults, we are always rushing around. The best way to divorce-proof a marriage begins before you ever meet your mate-to-be, during the dating process. Serial dating, especially when it involves premarital sex, is a course in how to get divorced. We end up hooking up and then when things go sour we run away. Donât get involved with someone who isnât a friend. And date at least 2 â 3 years before getting married. That way you can get over the initial 18 month crush where everything about the other person is fascinating and the whole infatuated view of âThe way you eat is so cute â it sounds like bells ringing,â to âIf you clang your fork off of your teeth again Iâm gojng to shove it through the back of your throat.â Not kidding â real conversation between my wife & I in the first year. Iâm glad to say she never jammed the fork through my throat and I learned to use my lips as a cushion between my fork & teeth. ï\n\n2) Keep Christ at the center of your marriage. It seems obvious, but it is essential. Every time you notice that ring on your finger, pray for your spouse. It doesn't have to be long or even audible. Just a quick mental thanks to God for your mate, or a quick thought of, ""God be with her/him."" \n\n3) Love is NOT give and take. There is no take in love. Read 1 Cor. 13 (the love chapter). Love is giving. I give to my wife. She gives to me. If both are giving no one needs to take. Develop this mindset and remember that this is what marriage is meant for. Eph 5 takes a lot of heat for telling wives to submit to their husbands. But it also tells husbands to submit to their wives. Give + give = love. Give + take = selfishness = unhappy = divorce.\n\n4) Never use derogatory names for each other, even in fun. Husbands, if you call your wife ""old lady"" that is what you will see in her over time. I call my wife ""my bride"", especially when I am upset with her. That way I remember that wedding day, all those dreams, etc.\n\n5) When kids are involved it is easy to place them in front of your spouse. While time with kids is important & shouldn't be neglected, those kids will grow up & move out one day. Your mate will still be there and you'll need something else to talk about besides the kids. Make a habit of dating. Guys, even ask your wife out on a date. Arrange the babysitter. Often couples in church can provide a wonderful service for each other by trading Fridays (or whatever day is appropriate).\n\n6) Get to know and socialize with an older Christian couple or two who have a happy long-term marriage. Learn from how to treat each other from them. Remember that we all face similar adaptation issues when we are first married & they have worked those issues out. Talk with them about what they had to work out in either early married years and how they resolved things. This can be one of the biggest benefits you ever have, especially if you come from a divorced family or a family with strained relations.\n\n7) It may seem obvious but pray together. Have individual quite times, but have a shared quite time as well, at least once a week. And no matter how much you think it will hurt or bother your mate, talk. Holding it in doesn't make it go away - it only makes it fester until you explode all over each other. Talk and if agreement needs intervention, see your pastor or a Christian counselor.\n\nMarriage is very frightening - especially for those of us who came out of dysfunctional families. But the single biggest cause of dysfunction in my experience (and in my family) was selfishness. Give to each other & to the Lord, and you too can have a happy marriage. God bless you & best wishes!"

Your asking about etiquette and that is based on what the majority of people feel is proper and right.  It does not mean that is liked or followed by everyone.  If you placed this question in a different category it could get a different response!  \n\nIf you get a lot of movie stars to appear in the movies running to the store with their jammies on then in time all other people would want to act just like the starts and in about another 10 or so years it would then be considered etiquette!\n\nSo it is more based on what the majority think and do. And this often changed over time by what the movie stars do and if we start to follow their examples.	Society & Culture

Whats the big scare with D.P.W.? . Whatâs the big scare with D.P.W.? I think itâs just from a big fear of Muslims that sprouted from the 9/11 attacks. I donât see the big threat of the deal, itâs a port company, and any threat would come from a SHIPPING company. My father works for D.P.W; we are AMERICAN and see no threat.

I think we are wary of muslams, it is a normal reaction to and action the way I see it. If 9/11 never happened it might be a differant story. But it did.

How to Process Polycarbonate Lenses? .  . Polycarbonates\nHow to tint them\n\nPolycarbonate lenses have always presented a challenge for those who wish to tint them. With lenses made from CR-39ï¿½ monomer plastic and BPIï¿½ Molecular Catalyticâ¢ tints the tinting process is much more straight forward. These tints use a carbon molecular that shares an electron with the carbon molecule in the plastic, so that the tint bonds to, and becomes part of the lens structure itself. The end result is that the lens cures in the tinting process and has a more scratch-resistant surface. Polycarbonate, unfortunately, is very resistant to tints. To tint polycarbonate lenses one must tint the scratch coating and the better the scratch coating the harder it is to tint. The first type of coatings that were applied to polycarbonate were so resistant to tints that obtaining a sunglass shade was almost, if not, impossible.\nIn recent years, the types of coatings that are used on polycarbonate lenses have changed considerably. It is much more common today to see a combination of coatings used on polycarbonate. Typically, the front surface, which tends to receive the most scratches, has been very effectively coated by the factory. The back surface is now commonly coated by the optical lab. The coating on the back surface is definitely tintable, even to relatively dark sunglass shades.\nThere are some fundamental principles for tinting polycarbonate that will help you considerably. (Many of these ideas apply equally well to tinting plastic lenses).\n\nBefore tinting:\nEnsure that both lenses are from the same source, preferably the same batch number. Polycarbonate and lenses made from CR-39ï¿½ monomer both vary significantly from different manufacturers and from manufacturerâs batches.\nClean the lenses with BPIï¿½ Lens Prep IIâ¢. This conditions the surface of the lens and reduces the surface tension of the scratch coating.\nCheck your lens tinting instrument thoroughly. Make sure that it is reaching and maintaining a steady temperature. Check the heat transfer fluid. If it looks old, replace it. Always use a quality product like BPIï¿½ heat transfer fluid. Use of other substances is not recommended and can be hazardous to your health. Ensure that the tint tank is immersed sufficiently into the heat transfer fluid in accordance with the manual of your lens tinting instrument. Mix the tints with distilled water. This will eliminate the possibility of any mineral contamination that may exist in your local water supply.\nMix and stir the tints well. Also, continue to stir the tints at regular intervals. If you notice patches of unevenness (blotches) in the tinted lenses, it is time to change the tint.\nCheck the temperature of your tint bath with a quality laboratory thermometer to ensure that the operating temperature of the tints is between 205ï¿½F and 210ï¿½F. Polycarbonate (or lenses made from CR-39ï¿½ monomer) will not tint properly at even slightly cooler temperatures. Finally, the coatings of polycarbonate lenses will absorb moisture from the air. This can create difficulty for the coatings to absorb tints. Reduce the exposure of the lenses to high levels of humidity (For instance, around a steaming tint bath) prior to tinting.\n\nDuring tinting:\nDetermine for yourself a standard for the particular tint that you are using. Use a sample lens with a freshly mixed batch of tint. Ensure that all the conditions above have been fulfilled. Tint the lens for 15 minutes. Rinse dry and set aside. Test future lenses that you tint with that color against the standard after 15 minutes. When the tint cease to match the standard, change the tint.\nA common mistake is trying to get more lenses from each batch of tint than is practical. It is much less expensive and time consuming to change the regularly than it is to keep pushing the numbers of lenses out of every batch.\nLimit the amount of time that the lens spends in the tint or neutralizer. You should not exceed a half hour. If you are typicall	Science & Mathematics

What causes ringing in the ears? .  . ringing in the ears is called Tinnitus \n\nCauses for Tinnitus or ringing in the ear: \n\nAge-related tinnitus causes - hearing loss (presbycusis) occurring usually around age 60. \n\nTrauma-related tinnitus causes - damage to the inner ear (could result from excessive exposure to loud sound). \n\nLong-term use of medications such as aspirin (in large doses), quinine (used in treatment of malaria), antibiotics and anti-inflammatory can be tinnitus causes. Often the unwanted noises disappear once the drugs are discontinued. \n\nTemporomandibular joint problems (jaw disorders resulting in clicking or grating noises) can be one of the tinnitus causes. \n\nOtosclerosis (stiffening of the bones in the middle ear). \n\nTrauma or injury to the head or neck can be a tinnitus cause. \n\nEar wax â Buildup of excess wax in the ear can reduce your ability to hear outside noises, and can be tinnitus causes by causing you to hear internal noises better. \n\nEar infection â If an infection reduces your ability to hear outside noises, you are more likely to hear the noises related to Tinnitus. \n\nAtherosclerosis â Buildup of cholesterol and other fatty deposits causes tinnitus by causing the middle and inner ear to loose its elasticity which causes the blood flow to become more forceful which makes it easier for the ear to detect the beats. \n\nHigh blood pressure â High blood pressure and factors that increase the blood pressure such as stress, alcohol and caffeine are tinnitus causes and can make the sounds more noticeable. \n\nFood--Specific foods may trigger tinnitus. Problem foods include red wine, grain-based spirits, cheese, and chocolate. Tinnitus may also be caused by foods rich in salicylates (the same ingredient as in aspirin, which also causes tinnitus when taken in large amounts).  \n\nGrowths/tumors--Acoustic neuromas, glomous tumors, otosclerosis may all be tinnitus causes. Surgery may be recommended. \n\nStress--Stress is not a direct cause of tinnitus, but it may generally make an already existing case worse. \n\nSince tinnitus might be a symptom of another health problem, see your doctor for any hearing concerns.  Caffeine, tobacco, alcohol, aspirin, antihistamines, and prescription or even over-the-counter medications can aggravate existing tinnitus and are tinnitus causes.  Although there remains no cure, tinnitus symptoms can be overcome.  RingStop is designed to safely relieve and prevent tinnitus and ear noise symptoms.	Science & Mathematics

what is isoflavonoids and tanins? . explain details on determination, structure, and functions with chemical structure. . Isoflavonoids are a class of flavonoids that are derived in the human diet mainly from soybean-based foods. The major dietary isoflavonoids, genistein and daidzein, have estrogen-like activity and are classed as phytoestrogens. Because estrogens can lower serum LDL cholesterol and raise HDL cholesterol, the objective of this study was to determine if isoflavonoids could improve serum lipids in healthy subjects. Forty-six men and 13 postmenopausal women not receiving hormone replacement therapy completed a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of two-way parallel design and 8 wk duration. One tablet containing 55 mg of isoflavonoids (predominantly in the form of genistein) or one placebo tablet was taken daily with the evening meal. Subjects maintained their usual diet and physical activity, which were unchanged throughout the intervention. Measurement of isoflavonoids and their metabolites in 24-h urine samples provided an assessment of compliance and of isoflavonoid metabolism. Serum total, LDL, HDL and HDL subclass cholesterol, triglycerides and lipoprotein (a) were assessed at baseline and during the last week of intervention. After adjustment for baseline values, no significant differences in postintervention serum lipid and lipoprotein (a) concentrations between groups were identified. Further adjustment for age, gender and weight change did not alter the results. In addition, changes in urinary isoflavonoids were not significantly correlated with changes in serum lipids and lipoprotein (a). Therefore, this study does not support the hypothesis that isoflavonoid phytoestrogens can improve the serum lipids, at least in subjects with average serum cholesterol concentrations.\n\nThe chemical structure of isoflavones is very similar to that of our own estrogen. Because of this similarity in structure, isoflavones can interfere with the action of our own estrogen. Sometimes isoflavones will reduce the effects of estrogen because they compete with the same receptor sites on our cells. Some of the risks of excess estrogen can be lowered in this way.\n\nIsoflavones can also increase the estrogen activity. If during menopause the body's natural level of estrogen drops, isoflavones can compensate this by binding to same receptor sites, thereby easing menopause symptoms as a result. The best way to consume isoflavones is in the form soy or soyfoods, so you can benefit from other healthy components of soy. Soy contains many types of isoflavones, but the most beneficial are genistein (see picture) and daidzein. The highest amounts of isoflavones can be found in soy nuts and tempeh. Isoflavones are fairly stable. Under normal cooking conditions, isoflavones are not destroyed.\n\n\n\ntannin, tannic acid, or gallotannic acid, astringent vegetable product found in a wide variety of plants. Sources include the bark of oak, hemlock, chestnut, and mangrove; the leaves of certain sumacs; and plant galls. Tannin is also present in tea, coffee, and walnuts. A solution of tannic acid is obtained from one of these natural sources by extraction with hot water; in particular, gallotannic acid is obtained from plant gall. Tannin varies somewhat in composition, having the approximate empirical formula C76H52O46. Tannic acid is a colorless to pale yellow solid; it is believed to be a glucoside in which each of the five hydroxyl groups of the glucose molecule is esterified with a molecule of digallic acid. Tannin is used in tanning animal skins to make leather; it transforms certain proteins of animal tissue into compounds that resist decomposition. It is also used in manufacturing inks, as a mordant in dyeing, and in medicine as an astringent and for treatment of burns.	Science & Mathematics

They see you break the law, so they enforce it. Its really that simple. If you are speeding then they might just give you a friendly warning to slow down- remember that traveling at excessive speeds puts not only your life at risk, but the lives of those around you. The laws were created to keep us all safe and living peacefully amongst ourselves. If there were no police officers, this world would be in complete chaos. Just remember the next time that you are getting pulled over that the officer has a family, and understands where you are coming from.

The demon has collided with the ""will of the Kingdom."" The exorcist is now in direct battle with the demon, urging the entity to reveal more information about itself so it can be controlled. As previously mentioned, there is a connection between the entity and the victim's resident. The entity wants a place to be in, or it must return to Hell. An existence out of Hell is what the Devil or demon is fighting for. \nExpulsion: In the supreme triumph of God's will, the demon or spirit leaves in the name of Jesus.

"how can we control the ozone layer? .  . My Adventures in the Ozone Layer\nby S. Fred Singer\nNational Review, June 1989\n \nThe 123-nation Conference to Save the Ozone Layer, held in London in March 1989, ended with a whimper. The developing nations, principally China and India, were quite unconvinced by the evidence and unwilling to go along with the European Community and the United States in rushing to phase out completely the chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) and other widely used chemicals. It seems they know better.\n\nIt is rumored that Mrs. Thatcher was converted into a global ozone fan by Sir Crispin Tickell, the diplomat turned eco-freak. Lord knows who the President Bush has been listening to, but he deserves better advice.\n\nNow it's on to a European conference in the Hague to which Maggie and George have not been invited --tsk, tsk-- and then a follow- up to London in Helsinki in May. All this after the 1985 Vienna Convention, the Montreal Protocol (Sept 1987), Geneva, Toronto, and who knows how many other international gabfests in between. Who can keep track of them? Norway's Prime Minister Mrs. Gro Harlem Brundtland hardly spends time in Oslo anymore. My word! When do these people ever govern?\n\nThe hyperactivity this creates in the agencies, mainly in the State Department and EPA, has to be seen to be believed. The congressional Government Accounting Office would have done an investigation and totaled up the thousands of hours and the huge resources spent on this issue -- except for the fact that Congress and its staffs are just as involved. As the Hill folks try to outdo the Administration and the feds dream up new initiatives, things are building up to a fever pitch -- spurred on by lurid stories in the media about the imminent danger. ""Arctic Ozone is Poised for a Fall "" scream the headlines. ""Skin Cancer is on the Rise!"" \n\nIs it all hype? Or is it a hoax? And is the hysteria for real? As we'll see later, the scientific basis for the much-touted ozone crisis may be evaporating-- leaving the new breed of geo- eco-politicians high and dry.\n\n\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nHow did we get here? It's a long way from the supersonic transport to the Antarctic ""ozone hole"". But it all started with the SST, just twenty years ago. The emerging environmental movement scored its first great victory by convincing Congress to cancel the program to build two SST prototypes that would have been tested in the stratosphere. When sonic boom and noise objections didn't bring down the program, the activists discovered the stratospheric ozone layer and the fact that a fleet of 500 planes might have some influence on the ozone content of the upper atmosphere. Most influential was the argument that a reduction in the ozone content would increase the rate of skin cancers. That did it. And the skin cancer scare has been with us ever since, inextricably intertwined with the stratospheric ozone issue.\nThroughout these past two decades many truths were uncovered by outstanding and imaginative researchers, but many truths were not revealed to the public -- and quite a few things were propagated that departed from scientific truth. Scientists, by and large, behaved honorably, although egos and ambitions collided with the facts, tempting some to ignore facts. Politicians had no such problems or any hesitation to manipulate science and even scientists. And the media had a field day. Let me give you a personal account of this fascinating history.\n\nSSTs and Ozone\n\nI first got involved in the SST issue in 1970 while serving as a deputy assistant administrator of the EPA. I was asked to take on the additional task of chairing an interagency committee for the Department of Transportation on the environmental effects of the SST. Of course, I had some background in atmospheric physics, having been active in the earliest rocket experiments on the ozone layer, and even invented th"	Science & Mathematics
"How do animals perceive time? .  . That's hard, not sure. Just to guess depending on the species, a bat would tell time from photosensitivity as an example. Most birds may tell time the same or according to temperature changes. Now i'm gonna guess stupid, but i think fish tell time due to gravitational forces of the tide according with the moon. Someone debated me on that one before and said ""What if the moon isn't out?""  My response was that the moon is omnipresent orbiting the Earth; thing is, its simply in another hemisphere.  As I said, not sure, just guesses.  Perhaps physicist Steven Hawking thought about that at one point...lol."	Science & Mathematics

is there anything that gets rid of really deep streatch marks. due 2 baby? .  . No over-the-counter cream or lotion can remove those lines. Stretch marks occur in the middle layer of the skin, called the dermis, and common creams can't reach that far deep. Vitamin E and cocoa butter treatments can make your skin feel soft and supple, but they won't make your skin mark-free. You'll need to talk to a doctor, dermatologist, or plastic surgeon if you want to seriously reduce the lines. \nPrescription creams containing Tretinoin, also called Retin-A, may help reduce the appearance of fresh stretch marks. These creams should not be used during pregnancy or breastfeeding. This type of treatment will not eliminate stretch marks completely, and it won't work on older marks that have already faded from red. \nA French treatment called Endermologie claims to reduce scarring. A machine with rollers and gentle suction is used to massage and exfoliate the affected area. Again, this won't remove stretch marks, but it may enhance the overall appearance of the skin. \nLaser surgery is sometimes used to lessen the severity of stretch marks, but the results are mixed. Microdermabrasion has been somewhat more successful in changing the appearance of stretch marks. Both treatments are expensive and should only be performed by qualified doctors.	Health

Why isn't Hepatitis B included in STD package from L.A. county public health? . Hepatitis B is 100 times more infectious than HIV, and there are about 350 million people worldwide who are chronic carriers (compared to 40 million people worldwide who have HIV). AND sexual activity is the most common means of transmission.\n\nWith that said, any guesses to why L.A. county public health doesn't include hepatitis b in their STD package? . We don't do Hep B vaccines for adults simply because IT COSTS TOO MUCH. However, Hep B vaccinations are available to schoolkids.\n\nSTD Program routinely includes a lecture on Hep B during their STD presentations and even has an entire presentation devoted ot Hep A, B and C. STD also provides plenty of written material about the disease. STD did not forget about Hep B. It's just that they have budget constraints.\n\nBTW, worldwide, most transmission occurs vertically --> mother to baby during childbirth.	Health

Anyone good at solving vector question ? . a,b,c are non coplanar,unit vectors,equally inclined to each other at angle N. If  (axb)+(bxc)=pa+qb+rc\nFind scalars p,q,r in terms of N .\n\nPlease tell your working also . . This is a special case of finding the coordinates of a vector v in in a basis a, b, c with known scalar products a.b, b.c, and c.a, when the scalar products v.a, v.b, and v.c are also known. Multiply the eqn v = pa+qb+rc scalarly by a, b and c and write the result in matrix form. Now simply invert the 3x3 matrix G, called the Gram matrix, to express p, q, r in terms of the known scalar products.\n\nNow for the original question. When v = (axb)+(bxc), you get a.v=a.bxc, b.v=0 and c.v=c.axb=a.bxc. The mixed triple product a.bxc is +- the volume of the parallelepiped spanned by a, b and c. Assume that the system a b c (in this order) is right-handed so the sign is +. Also, (a.bxc)^2 equals the determinant of the Gram matrix G. When a b c are unit vectors inclined at angle N, the matrix G has units on the diagonal and cosN elsewhere, and detG = (1+2cosN)(1-cosN)^2.\nMultiplying it all out, you end up with \np = r = -sqrt(1+2cosN)\nq = 2cos(N)sqrt(1+2cosN)	Science & Mathematics

What do you think about the Schumi incident this weekend? . The marshalls decided to strip Michael Schumacher of his pole because of a driver error with little time left to qualify.  Many other drivers had to abort their fast laps because his car was in the way.  Some people say it was sabotage, but he was en route to set a new fastest lap.  What is your opinion? . This a very complex question, which requires a very complex answer. First of all, if Michael didn't have a set of precedents in his career, nobody would have incriminated him this time so severly. However, reputation is something that is like branding. I have been following F1 since I was eight while I lived in Europe (I am in the 40's now!!!! Auch!). So, what Michael indeed do in the past ended up being a catalyzer for the marshalls' decision at Monaco the other day, aside from future implications. \n\nYes, they reviewed data, info, questions and answers. However, unless you are Michael, there is nobody in the world who can honestly say if his action was premeditated, or if it was an error. I am a Ferrari fan, and the whole thing disappointed me to a great extent. But for the future of the sport, I truly believe that the decision was effective. You see, if they ruled otherwise, they would have left a can of worms open, leading to who knows how many cheating incidents in the future. \n\nSo, whether Michael did it on purpose or not, the FIA clearly sent a message that even if you try to think of cheating that way, you will be severly punished. Rightfully so. No doubts now!!!\n\nThat Michael tried to pull a fast one, is totally possible, but it is impossible to know the truth. We will never know the truth. It is irrelevant anyway, because the punishment was in the best interest of F1, and Schumi demonstrated anyway that his car, his tyres and himself are still the best, even starting from pit lane in a track like Monaco, where it is virtually impossible to pass.

What do you think of Sir Paul McCartney's wife Lady Heather Mills having Rory Emerald as a very close friend? . In your opinion, do you think Paul McCartney flipped out when he discovered that his 'media hungry wife' Heather Mills McCartney was best friends with 'media prankster' Rory Emerald? Do you think Paul knew this before he married her?\nHow did they pull-the-wool-over-his-eyes? Why are the tabloids so interested in this story? Especially the connection between Lady Heather Mills McCartney and Rory Emerald. . I think the whole relationship between Paul McCartney, Heather Mills and Rory Emerald is distasteful and disgusting.  \n\nThe love triangle between Paul McCartney, his lovely wife, Heather and Rory Emerald began a few years back at a formal dinner party in lower Manhattan, as recorded in New Yorker Magazine.  It seems that Rory Emerald had a rather unique and bizarre history with livestock and barnyard animals, which disgusted the former two.  Paul McCartney was livid at Mr. Emeraldâs callous attitude towards these animals, but Mr. Emerald managed to calm him down indicating he had a genuine love of these animals and often showered them with flowers and chocolates after these brief, but intense liaisons.  McCartneyâs wife, Heather, became transfixed by the whole thing and requested, if possible, is she would could watch the next encounter.  Paul McCartney admitted he too would enjoy the voyeuristic pleasure.  This became a ritual, and whenever Rory Emerald had the âurgesâ as he so aptly described it, he would ring up McCartney and wife.  Soon, Heather, Paul and Rory found themselves strange bedfellows indeed, in both the figurative and the literal sense.\n\nAfter the White House fiasco, which firmly put Rory Emerald in the spotlight, the older couple distanced themselves from any furor by removing themselves from his life.  As you well know, this is when Rory became involved with actress Jodie Foster.	Entertainment & Music

OOH... Math help plz, plz??? . Mom placed some cookies in a jar. Charles went to the jar and had 1/4 of the cookies. Ashley had 1/3 of the cookies left over by Charles. Dad went and had 1/2 of the cookies left over by Ashley. When Mrs. Kim went to the jar there were 2 cookies left. How many cookies did mom put into the cookie jar??? \n\nPlease explain as if u were teaching a 2 yr. old because I'm sort of stupid in Math!!! Also explain throughly what u did!!! . You start from the end and work backward.  If Dad ate half the cookies and left two, he must have eaten two so when he got there there were 4.  Ashley had just eaten 1/3 of the cookies, so she had left 2/3 in the jar.  Well, four is two/thirds of six so when she got there there were six cookies.  Charles had eaten 1/4 meaning he had left 3/4 of the cookies.  Well, 6 is 3/4 of 8 so originally there were 8 cookies in the jar.  Good luck, hope that helped.	Science & Mathematics

However, my car's in the shop and its not looking good financially or even if its repairable. I've checked to see if there is pace transportation there but there's not. My rent was due by the 3rd of June,today is the 10th of June. I know the office is going to start precedings if I don't get the rent in there asap and I will also have to pay court costs.I have not let the office know anything about my situation yet cause the car went out in the past 24 hrs.I know they have their rules. But I can't get to work,cause of the car.Does anybody know how long I have before the sheriff will come to my door?Is there a place I can move to like a studio/1 bedroom while I get on my feet?If I try to find an apt no ones going to rent to me cause they think I'm not business worthy,but I am.Please respond especially apartment managers.Thanks . What you need to do is to talk to the apartment manager and describe your situation. See if you can pay partial rent and a late fee and hold off for a couple of weeks until you get back on your feet. You must keep the lines of communication open and show what you are doing to resolve this issue that you have caused. I, personally, would have done this before the rent was due.\n\nHowever, if you can't bounce back, see if the manager will allow you to sublet the apartment. Also, If you could find a qualified tennant to fill your apartment while you rent a room from someone else, maybe the apartment manager will not evict you and let you break the lease. \n\nAfter all is said and done, you are responsible for your own situation and problems. Your loss of emplyment and the status of transportation are only factors in your life, they do not relieve you of your responsibility (unless you're a democrat or a liberal, but that's another story). After all, I can't call up my bank and say ""Yeah, I can't pay my mortgage on my apartment building this month because this tennant in unit #211 made some poor choices in her life.

the first thing you would do if you were the president of US? .  . remodel (no just kidding?)\n\nI would, if I could, reform our voting/election system. (I realize I'd need congress so I'd go to someone aware of the problems we had in Ohio 2004 like Kucinich, Conyers, or Tubb-Jones and ask them to draft a bill, etc)\n\n1. no more electoral college\n\n2. public funding of elections\n\n3. No advertising..each candidate gets a block of free time on TV to say whatever they want about their platform etc and that is it.\n\n4. For debate, there would be no preselecting questions, questions off the table etc.  It would be open to citizens by random drawing or something. People could ask whatever they wanted, and there would not be allowed any media discussion or who won the debate projections,,just they do debate, it ends and go to the regular program.\n\n5. A bigger state than New Hampshire with a diverse population starts primaries, litle or no media input on it as they have too much power to pick the candidate while making us think we pick them by what they say (unless there were no corporate owned media conglomerates but a lot of diverse stations not all owned by the same guy.) No polls or projections of who will get the nominations in a horse race fashion that really influnences people's votes.  More rules for the media and time limit on how long they report on it to lesson their influence on elections.  I would rather give the time of all their chattering and influencing to the candidates to give voters a real idea of who the person is, what they believe,how they would handle problems directly from them, instead of all the media chattering and influencing.  Let the people decide on their own gut feelings and what the candidate says.  Rarely do we ever get to hear what the candidate says is important to them when all we get is rebuttal attack ads and preprogrammed question and time limits at debate.   A limit on and accounting of all spending by candidates for extras not publicly funding.  It really should be possible for anyone to run for president without being millionairres and raising tons of money and all the political favors that obligates politicians,  \n\n6. There would be instant runoff voting to allow third parties a chance (for instance, take Nader, Bush, and Kerry..if you like Nader, then Kerry, but not Bush.  If you vote your first choice (Nader) and he doesn't have enough votes, your vote then goes to your 2nd choice (Kerry) and not to help Bush.\n\n7. Election day as a holiday. Separate ballots or elections for president (and possibly high offices and statewide issues to speed counting time).\n\n8. Paper Ballots hand-counted at the ballots, using these steps.\n\na. paper ballots with a number that are available in various languages and braille that you can get in advance in places like libraries..prefill in and bring to the polls\n\nb. All voting will be done at the high school building where a child living at your address will go. that way there is no confusion on where to go..just ask some of your neighbors.  No sending people to different locations and frustrating them so they don't vote.  Here it is always the same.\n\nc. Appoint each county with a citizen run , nonpartisan board that oversees all pre, during, and after elections proceedings and files public reports.  so people are aware if they are doing things like Blackwell, Ohio's secretary of state, did like throwing new registrations away if they were on the wrong weight of paper or if they put the wrong number from the 2 on the driver's licence or if they short the machines or harass people at the polls etc.  All is publicly observed and recorded and reported.\nd.  when the voter gets to the high school, a greeter tells them which classroom is their precinct (no more than 100 or 200 voters per precinct.

Should I worry about my heart rate going up to 195-200 when working out? . When I do cardio exersize, even as short as 10-15 minutes, my reart rate goes up to 190-200 and stays in that range for the duration of the workout.  I am a healthy, active,  25 year old and I have been to the doctor for check ups and there have never been any issues with my heart before.  Is this something I should be highly concerned about, or just remember to mention it at my next check up?  Thanks for any help/advice! . 195-200 is exceptionally high.  Especially if you are maintaining that for 10-15 min.  You're 25 years old.  Your maximum heart rate should not exceed 195 (220-25) for any long or extending periods during your training.  I would be curious to know what:\n\n#1: what is your resting heart rate?\n#2: what is your resting and active blood pressure before and after exercise.  \n\nYou may have tachycardia (abnormally rapid beating of the heart) which would explain the exceptionally high heart rate during exercise.  My resting heart rate is 55, and the only time I can maintain a heart rate of 195 for any length of time is during a VO2 max test which is no longer than 2min spurts.  It would be physiologically very difficult for any 25 year old to maintain that heart rate for 10-15 minutes (regardless of fitness) without having predisposed tachycardia.\n\nIt's nothing to be too alarmed about as there are many athletes with tachycardia who can still perform quite well, however I would advise you to get it checked out through your Physician and you may require a stress test to validate initial findings.\n\nYou can calculate your risks of exercise including tachycardia here:\nhttp://preventdisease.com/healthtools/articles/exercise_risk.html	Health

is there any sites that offer live weather radar without delays? .  . Technically, no, there isn't any web site which offers truly delay-free radar imagery. This is because Doppler radar takes time (5 minutes in clear-air mode, 3 in severe weather mode) to pan the horizon. It's a mechanical device, with a narrow field of view, so it must rotate in order to complete each image. However, there are web sites which update their radar imagery in real-time, as the image is relayed. The one I tend to use is www.weathertap.com, an excellent and well-regarded site for and by severe weather experts. It's a premium site, but for $4/month, you get real-time Doppler feeds with movable zoom, and all possible products (including multi-tilt storm relative velocity, radial velocity, echo tops, VAD, vertically integrated liquid, everything). You also get extremely high res visible sat imagery (to 1-km), lightning data, and (a boon to aviation people) aviation weather products with official route briefings and a link to DTC DUATS. Clearly, this is not necessarily the site for civilians and it has a steep learning curve, but it is the best available.	Science & Mathematics

Answer to the first part of thequestion;  \n\nConsider a water tank full of water.We connect a pump which pumps the water from the tank and delivers it again to the tank. \n The tank will never be empty and the water will be flowing continuously along the pipe connected to the pump and tank.\nIf the pipe connecting the pump and tank has an obstacle say a solid block of wood  which is somehow inserted into the pipe, then there will not be flow of water. But still the pipe and tank will have water but with out  any flow. \n Similarly in an electrical circuit electrons are like water in the tank ;the wire is like the pipe; the battery or cell or generator of electicity is like the pump in our example.\n Electrons flow from one end(tank) of the battery(pump) to the other end (tank) through the wire like water through the pipe.\n If one end of a wire is connected to the battery and the other end is left free,we have to imagine that the free end is further connected to the battery by an imaginary wire made of air.( The only matter that connects the free end to the battey is air) Just like water cannot flow through the wooden obstacle electrons cannot flow through air. Though the wire is full of electrons there will not be any flow of  electrons. \n\nAnswer to the second question,'Y dont they fall when they reach the end.\n\nThe wire is full of electrons even if there is no flow. We shall lift one end of the wire and let  the other end loose. It is natural to expect all the electrons in the wire to fall down due to gravity. But the electostatic force beeing very much stronger than the gravitational force keeps them within the wire. To remove them out we must apply a force atleast equal to the electostatic force. The function of the battery, in fact ,is  to provide such a force.	Science & Mathematics

"How can I tell if.....? . i might be a he-she i am not sure, i ahve this rare syndrom were i have both traits, does anyone know how to help? . It's called intersex, and here's links that may help.\n\nIntersex Defined:  A person who is born between (inter) sexes, having partially or fully developed pairs of female and male sex organs.  Intersexed is prefered over the word hermaphrodite.  Also, intersexism should be used in place of intersexuality to try and be consistent in this distinction. It is purely a physical and gender thing and not a sexual one beyond the physical of the sex organs.  Otherwise, this is all about âsexâ organs and not âsexualâ organs. \n-\nOrigin of the Term:  Hermaphroditus, the merger of the mythological Greek god, Hermes, and goddess, Aphrodite, into one body. The term intersex came into being as early as 1949, and is the preferred term today. In fact most intersexed people do not consider themselves to be both sexes, which is what the term hermaphrodite implies.\n-\nThe Issue of Sexual Assignment at Birth...\n   From the moment of birth, everybody wants to know if it is a boy or a girl.  This question can be complicated when a third option is introduced.  One out of every two thousand children in America is born intersexual (125,000 living in the United States today--enough to fill a good sized city). There is a point in fetal development when the sex of the child could go either way.  The only reason you are not the opposite sex had to do with something called testosterone.  The fetus that becomes a male is bathed with it, whereas, it is absent in the development of a female.  In one case, the sexual organ extends itself into a penis.  Conversely, a fetus becomes female when there is no release of testosterone and the sexual organ extends inwardly.  The natural development from that moment on determines which sex we are to become.\n   However, sometimes biology malfunctions and children are born with mixed sexual characteristics in what is called an intersexual birth.  For some intersexuals, whether they are boys or girls is never really clear to them.  Many argue that the standard practice of sexual assignment by surgery in infancy should be discontinued giving the intersexual the right to choose or not to choose surgery once that individual reaches adolescence.  Whatever the choice, intersexuals show us that gender is infinitely more complex than the shape of our genitals.\n--\nFive Sexes...\n   What are herms, merms and ferms? \nThese terms were used by Anne Fausto-Sterling in her 1993 article in _The Sciences_ ""The Five Sexes: Why Male and Female are not enough"". Herm refers to ""true hermaphrodite""; a merm would be a person born intersexed whose karyotype was XY (nominally male) and a ferm is an XX intersexed person (nominally female). These delineations serve to educate people that sex is not a bipolar dichotomy, but they do not really classify intersexed people themselves in any meaningful way. \n   If abnormalities of cell division occur, a fetus with mosaicism may result. The baby may have both cells with 46 XY chromosomes and cells with 46 XX chromosomes. This is the condition referred to a hermorphoditism.  Because both male and female cells exist within the same fetus, both male and female structures develop. Typically, the penis is not completely virilized (hypospadias). One or both testes may not be palpable or they may be palpable, but undescended. Whenever you see an infant with both hypospadias and an undescended testis (cryptorchidism), the result is hermaphroditism. \n   Hydroxylase deficiency in female embryos causes androgenic stimulation and development of the genital tubercle and labio-scrotal folds just as normal production of testosterone does in male embryos. This can result in a female infant having marked enlargement of the clitoris to the degree that it takes the appearance of a penis and fusion of the labioscrotal folds into a scrotum-like structure.\n-\nUnderstanding the Complexities of Intersexuality...\n   Anne Fausto-Sterling wrote, ""At birth, instead of hearing the i"	Health

Are trees bulletproof? . In movies, whenever there's a shootout, somebody always takes cover behind a tree. We see bullets hit the tree, but never do they hit the guy. . Depends on the thickness.  A two-foot radius tree is most likely impenetrable and a bullet won't kill it.  It will however, lodge itself in the tree.  A 6-inch radius tree is most likely not bulletproof and the bullet will go through it.  Lastly, as far as I know, no tree can deflect a bullet, if that's what you were wondering.	Sports

Can a back injury cause this to happen to my bladder? . I injured my back and was told I probably have a bulged disc. Since the injury I have had problems with my bladder that are slowly getting worse. It started as trouble starting my stream. Now I go a ton of times during the day, but only tiny amounts and always feel like I have to go but can't. Since yesterday I have started dribbling a bit. Usually a couple minutes after I finish. I will leave the bathroom start doing whatever and a tiny bit of urine flows out. Could this be from my back injury or something else? Any ideas on what I should do? It's becoming quite bothersome and a bit scary. . What you are describing is one symptom of Cauda Equina Syndrome.  It is rare but it is also a medical emergency.  Your buldging disc could be pressing against the bundle of nerve roots (causa equina) at the end of the spinal cord.  The nerve roots are compressed or paralyzed, which cuts off sensation and movement of bowel/bladder and lower extremeties.  Permenant damage may occur if treatment is not received quickly.  I hope this is not the case, but I want you to be fully informed.  Whenever I have a patient with a low back injury I tell them the warning signs of CES and instruct them to go to the ER if the following occurs:\n\n# Bladder and/or bowel dysfunction, causing you to retain waste or be unable to hold it.\n# Severe or progressive problems in the lower extremities including loss of or altered sensation between the legs, over the buttocks, inner thighs and back of legs (saddle area), and feet/heels.\n# Pain, numbness or weakness spreading to one or both legs that may cause you to stumble or have difficulty getting up from a chair.

could giant humming bird hover as well as a regular sized humming bird? . if one were to create a genetically modified humming bird the size of, say a helicopter, could it behave as dynamically as its tiny counterpart? if so, we could probably find a way to train them like horses and ride them around, and that would totally rule! . Nope.  As the proportions of the hummingbird gets bigger their weight, which is proportional to volume, also gets bigger.  Strength on the other hand is known to be roughly proportional to the cross section of muscle for any particular limb.  The same calculations are used for weight lifting events, and tell us if a 200 lb athlete did a better lift than a 180 lber.  I\n\nIn addition to all that, the bones also do not increase in nearly as much volume proportionatly as the meat.  The hummingbird would snap its bones trying to flap them that fast, but it probably wouldn't even be able to fly at all.  Because of all these limits on our structures, any animal that big begins taking on the weightlifter build.  For birds, the limit is that of the condor and it glides everywhere it goes.  The albatross is so fat at 30 lbs it already has trouble taking off and landing, so much so that its nickname is the goony bird.  30 lbs :that's the upper limit for birds on Earth right now.   \n\nThe teratorn is the largest bird that's ever been found at 160 - 170 lbs with a 25 foot wingspan and 11 feet from beak to tail, and it's EXTINCT.  We've only found the bones of one located in Argentina.  It seems hard to believe that a bird of that size would even be able to get off the ground, but it all the bones for flight so it must have.  This teratorn was a gliding bird of prey that closely resembled the eagle.

can we define love? . when i am in love, 'I' want to be with the person bcos 'I' love him.bcos  'I' like everything about him,'I' like what he does to me,how he behaves with me.'I' cannot love some one who treats me badly.living vwith this person makes 'ME' happy.when it is 'I' and 'me' every where isn't love selfish.isn't it how we all feel. . The very fundamental thing we find in love is being liked and be very comfortable in a relation. And this act of mutually impressing each other may not be perpetual. This is where the discretion about true love comes. Its not really necessary that the person who gets irked or infuriated makes you feel not loved. Its the amount of our own patience and understanding we offer in return to his or her mood swings. Sounds tough... But believe me... Its the only way to retain and preserve love. Though love is generated from heart and definitely must not be a product of brain... one must not ignore the subtle hints given by brain too. Not to interpret the cautions in a negative way but to protect our loved one from possible errors and fallacies. Love is a strenuous journey if it needs to be navigated though impatience and misunderstanding. But at the end of the day if one believes that we truly love someone.... any sacrifice offered to make them happy is worthy of all those cherished moments we experienced and enjoyed with that person.

what is rf plasma? what is it for especially in surface modification? .  . I don't completely understand your question.\n\nPlasma is the fourth state of matter, neither solid nor liquid nor gas. It sort of plays by it's own rules. In essence, plasma is an gas (Argon for example) that is excited to a higher energy level by the application of some external stimulus. Case in point would be a welder's gas shielded welding torch, in which a gas (Argon or CO2) is fed through a hose to the torch nozzle. The gas is energized by an RF current that flows through the hose assembly in addition to a heavy direct current to provide heat. The gas ionizes, creating a plasma, and when expelled from the torch, functions as a shield to protect the molten metal from contamination by our atmosphere until it solidifies. \n\nThe main function of a plasma in other industrial context is to provide heat. I have heard that a plasma (lightning for instance) can achieve temperatures nearly six times the surface temperature of our sun. A plasma cutting torch, as I understand it uses the heat of a plasma to heat the work surface to the melting point after which a cut is made by blowing compressed gas through the metal. A rapid non-combustion method of cutting steel.\n\nA flame is also a plasma. In industrial applications, a flame from a pilot burner (in a boiler for example) will allow electricity to only flow through it in one direction, much like a solid state diode. If one places two probes into a flame but separated from each other, and impresses an alternating current on one, a direct current will be received from the other when a flame is present, thereby proving the existance of a pilot flame before the main burner is allowed to operate. \n\nHope this helps\n\nOuzinki	Science & Mathematics

NO. So eternal fire is not speaking of an undying flame, but rather a lasting/eternal effect.\n\nThis makes Malachi 4:3 clear when you read:\n\n""And ye shall tread down the wicked; for they shall be ashes under the soles of your feet in the day that I shall do this, saith the LORD of hosts.""\n\nThe wicked perish, and become ash, what is more clear than that.

do you think personal looks mean any thing to a women? .  . I would say that a well-groomed woman would probably want to date a well-groomed man.

My best advise is this... make your own choices and build your life. You can't plan for a man to come into your life, and when he does it will probably upset your apple cart a bit... that  is what love does. To meet a nice, good, and strong, man you should try looking in quieter places and not night spots.

"so wat are the effects of steriods, ive been thinking about it but scared about the side effects? . i have heard that u get sever acne and ur testis shrink but i was wondering if there is something else . If the proper ""stack"" is used and you don't over do it in the gym steroids are pretty safe and give great results. Its the things you hear about ""juicers"" that give steroid's a bad name. Just remember to do the research and find out what you want from the drug. i.e. more endurance, more muscle mass, or just get stronger. Don't jump into it without knowing what your getting into. Also, its addicting because of the fast gains you will see. \n\nHope this helpes:\n\nAnabolic steroids (AS) are effective in enhancing athletic performance. The trade off, however, is the occurrence of adverse side effects which can jeopardize health. Since AS have effects on several organ systems, a myriad of side effects can be found. In general, the orally administered AS have more adverse effects than parenterally administered AS. In addition, the type of AS is not only important for the advantageous effects, but also for the adverse effects. Especially the AS containing a 17-alkyl group have potentially more adverse affects, in particular to the liver. One of the problems with athletes, in particular strength athletes and bodybuilders, is the use of oral and parenteral AS at the same time (""stacking""), and in dosages which may be several (up to 40 times) the recommended therapeutical dosage. The frequency and severity of side effects is quite variable. It depends on several factors such as type of drug, dosage, duration of use and the individual sensitivity and response.\n\nLiver Function\n\nAS may exert a profound adverse effect on the liver. This is particularly true for orally administered AS. The parenterally administered AS seem to have less serious effects on the liver. Testosterone cypionate, testosterone enanthate and other injectable anabolic steroids seem to have little adverse effects on the liver. However, lesions of the liver have been reported after parenteral nortestosterone administration, and also occasionally after injection of testosterone esters. The influence of AS on liver function has been studied extensively. The majority of the studies involve hospitalized patients who are treated for prolonged periods for various diseases, such as anemia, renal insufficiency, impotence, and dysfunction of the pituitary gland. In clinical trials, treatment with anabolic steroids resulted in a decreased hepatic excretory function. In addition, intra hepatic cholestasis, reflected by itch and jaundice, and hepatic peliosis were observed. Hepatic peliosis is a hemorrhagic cystic degeneration of the liver, which may lead to fibrosis and portal hypertension. Rupture of a cyst may lead to fatal bleeding.\n\nBenign (adenoma's) and malign tumors (hepatocellular carcinoma) have been reported. There are rather strong indications that tumors of the liver are caused when the anabolic steroids contain a 17-alpha-alkyl group. Usually, the tumors are benign adenoma's, that reverse after stopping with steroid administration. However, there are some indications that administration of anabolic steroids in athletes may lead to hepatic carcinoma. Often these abnormalities remain asymptomatic, since peliosis hepatis and liver tumors do not always result in abnormalities in the blood variables that are generally used to measure liver function.\n\nAS use is often associated with an increase in plasma activity of liver enzymes such as aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), alkaline phosphatase (AP), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and gamma glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT). These enzymes are present in hepatocytes in relatively high concentrations, and an increase in plasma levels of these enzymes reflect hepatocellular damage or at least increased permeability of the hepatocellular membrane.\n\nIn longitudinal studies of athletes treated with anabolic steroids, contradictory results were obtained on the plasma activity of liver enzymes (AST, AST, LDH, GGT, AP). In some studies, enzymes were i"	Health

If you are doing things you are ashamed of, then you need to stop doing those things.  It really just depends on your reason for it.\n\nIf you don't know the reason, or you can't fix the underlying problem, I recommend counselling.

"i need information on racial profilling? . i need o write a paper regarding police actions that may infringe on our 4th amendment rights . Racial profiling as in ""be on the lookout for a black male, 25 to 30 years of age,"" is certainly a form of racial profiling; however, racial profiling per-se is not a fair nor a tool that is required by law enforcement.\nAs an example I will pose a hypothetical situation involving an African-American middle aged woman that has been found murdered. \nIt will be a justifiable opinion that the murderer may have been an African-American male for the reason that 'blacks tend to murder blacks' as middle aged whites tend to kill/rape/serial murder other whites who are mainly women but also children and other men.\nThese are general statistics that are used in homicide investigations and which are not necessarily biased either toward one race or another, but however do hold investigative value for the control of crime. \n\nâIn Criminal Justice, the issue is not how to protect the offender from the arbitrariness of the state, but how to bring the state more effectively to the aid of the offender.â \nâThe State is not a Behemoth to be chained and fettered, but an agent capable of fulfilling an ambitious program. Thus a policy that calls for the statesâ exercise of discretionary authority in finely tuned responses is at its core Progressive.â [The Positivist School]; [p 65]\n\nIn concluding and in my opinion it is not a biased attitude that is applied in certain criminal circumstances by police investigations but rather a more positive and direct methodology that allows for a quicker solution to a crime and its future control for the better safety of our society.  Try to find out about investigative techniques and you will find that the objective towards the resolution of a crime must be free of personal bias and a respect afforded for the constituitional rights of the accused/person of interest.

Make time for a new hobby. \n\nWould it be fun to take an overnight trip to a National Park or go spelunking or take in a show on Broadway?  Maybe you would like to invite a friend and plan together.  Maybe you would need to do some research or see a travel agent.  Maybe you need to save up a little money.  Make longer short term goals so that you have something to work towards while enjoying the here and now.\n\nThen look towards the future.  Where would you like to be down the road?  How can you work towards those goals?  A change in your educational goals?  A shift in financial planning and budgeting?  Don't forget to keep your eye on the horizon while catching opportunities that exist along the paths you are presently traveling.  Intersections appear frequently along the road.  \n\nSo, pick up your quiver and look around you.  Find your target, take aim, and shoot for the bullseye.  Then, when you have practiced on short range goals, take aim for the goals that appear further away.  And keep your eye on the prize.\n\nGood luck to you.  And remember, practice makes perfect."

why only tungesten is used as a filament of bulb? .  . It isn't the only material for light filaments but it is the most used material. \n\nThe lamp industry represents the largest commercial application of tungsten wire. It is used in this application because it displays excellent creep resistance at elevated temperatures. Tungsten is an attractive lamp filament material because it has an extremely high melting temperature (~3,695 K) and a low vapour pressure at high temperatures. Tungsten is also intrinsically brittle and, initially, this prevented the manufacture of tungsten wire.  But advances in metallurgy enabled tungsten wire and coil filaments to be handled without breakage, so tungsten became the backbone of the whole incandescent lamp industry.	Education & Reference

Your advice please? . I live in the U.S. where soccer isn't nearly as popular as the big 3 (football, baseball, and basketball). I love to play and watch football (American football, not soccer) and basketball but I have a lot of friends who play soccer. I find it interesting to play even though I'm not good at it at all. i don't know many of the rules of soccer but I want to learn them. Also, I'm trying to watch some of the World Cup but since I don't understand soccer, I don't get what happens a lot of the time in soccer games, so now is the perfect time for me to know the rules. What advice do you have so that I can learn the rules and have more fun playing soccer with friends and be able to understand the sport while watching the World Cup? . The very best thing is to have someone who knows the game well and won't mind answering questions watch with you.  When something comes up, you can ask, but they can also tell you what's going on.  As helpful as it is to read the written rules, it doesn't make nearly as much sense as when you see them in practice.  I've never seen the rules other than to look something up when disputing a call, but I grew up with a father and brothers who explained everything to me when I asked.  Someone who knows the game can explain the intricacies and give you more insight into what's going on, as well as explain to you why they're choosing to play a certain way.  It's much more fun to watch if you can anticipate what's going to happen, especially with the World Cup games.  When I coach soccer, the best learning tool for the boys on the sidelines is having them tell me what's going on, why things worked/didn't work, what the call was for, etc., then praising or correcting them, or giving them other options to look at.

Through the S&FR law, Illinois citizens are protected from uninsured motorists.\n\nFinancial Responsibility Insurance is required in Illinois by individuals with safety responsibility suspensions (Type Action 04), unsatisfied judgment suspensions (Type Action 06), revocations (Type Action 01 and 02) and mandatory insurance supervisions.\n\nThe insurance must be submitted on a Financial Responsibility Certificate (SR-22) from the home office of the insurance company. The issuing insurance company must be authorized to write financial responsibility insurance in Illinois and have a ""power of attorney"" on file in Illinois. Our office maintains a listing of authorized agents and companies."	Business & Finance

When do banks pay out interest on Savings accounts and returns on Investments? . I want to make a few investments and open up a prime rate savings account. When in the month do banks pay out the interest and the returns on investments? . This depends onthe bank and savings acct you open.  Most compound interest daily but either pay it monthly or quarterly.  It sounds like a money market acct may be a good option for you, the interest rates are generally higher than traditional savings accts and do require a larger initial deposit.  READ THE TERMS AND FINE PRINT FIRST!!\n\nWhat you mean about returns on investments,I am not sure... banks do not handle and pay on brokerage accounts if that is what you are referring to..

"How can the liberals say they love everyone in third world nations; and hate their neighbor? .  . I guess you're talking about the morons on here (and their counterparts in the real world) who spew nothing but hatred for anyone who disagrees with them about anything.\n\n1.  I think they never learned to think for themselves.  They've only been taught WHAT to think, so when they encounter different opinions, all they can do is yell.  They can't hold a reasoned discussion.\n\n2.  They're not really liberals in the truest sense of the word.  A real liberal supports freedom for all people.  They may be social liberals, but I even doubt that. In America, however, the economic liberals have traditionally been called conservatives or libertarians.  When's the last time you heard a so-called ""liberal"" in America talk about 'economic liberalization'?\n\n3.  It's not really love they feel for people in the developing world.  It's a combination of guilt and pity. They feel guilty because they have something that others don't, and they don't understand why. And they pity the poor people who don't live like them. It's easier to pity, because that carries with it no requirement to effect change.  All you have to do is feel sorry.  If they met real people in a developing nation, they wouldn't really want to associate with them socially, or see them succeed.  Because, after all, success is equal to greed in the modern American liberal's mind.  We wouldn't want to corrupt the helpless with success.  Instead, they just want to give handouts and feel good about themselves.  There's a moral superiority here...they truly believe that they're doing the right thing.  The sad thing is that their policies have perpetuated poverty around the world. \n\nThe confused mind of American ""liberals"" is a result of not understanding economics.  But only recently has all that confusion turned into outright hatred.  All this hatred doesn't bode well for the future."	Politics & Government

Im soo mad? . What can i do to ignore pepole's snotty comments? I was on one of my favorite message boards and this girl sais she thought that a joke about white was funny. And that was the 2nd time this wee she has said something about whites. And i spoke up and told her im mixed and i dont appriciate the fact that she would say something about 1 paticular race.. and she said she not rasist so i apolizize for making a false judgment and she starts getting geek { for pepole who dont know what that means it means smart} and I tried to drop it but now it wont be dropped. I dunno.. Any tips on how to ignore things like this without me feeling like Im not sticking up for my race? Thanks . The real answer leads one to another truth.  God did not\n  make mixes as HIS people.  This is not some slurring thing,\n   the trustworthiness of mature people includes what they,\n   themselves do to make themselves smarter, more christian.\n   A good example of the features of dark and white is that they\n   are common in the frontiers of the militants, where insignia\n   blessings and sharing is the actual published golden rule.  In\n   our world, in the middle of broadcast, the rule of peace is the\n   important point.  Realizing you may be highly educated can\n   be truly in comparison to the hardy values of natives.

"Are horoscopes true? is there somewhere i could go to learn? Sometimes they scare me cuz they are right.? . i read my horoscopes everyday and they always seem to be true in some way. .it's freaky and i want to know how people know that.\nAnd if anyone knows any really good horoscope sites... plz tell!!! . Yes, but to read only ones Sun sign, ( Newspaper,Horoscope) is to use Astrology in it's weakest form.\n\n So to think horoscopes can be true or accurate in a newspaper, would only be right, about 1/12th of the time. To use a complete Astrological chart of the exact time, and location of birth, is absolutely always constant.\n\nAstrology is a system (communication) a perfectly logical system that's often described as equal parts ""science"" and art. Whatever you call it, it works. Honest.\n\n Astrology is about (communication) understanding yourself, and others better. About drawing parallels between the movements of real planets in our universe, that follow precise mathematical orbits.\n\n I took some classes a couple years back, have been studying ever since it is ""freaky, and truly amazing"". Try enrolling in a class with others who want to learn about it too, and pick up a book or two also. Astrology for the Light Side of the Brain by Kim Rogers-Gallager is a really good one. Astro.com will give you a complete free chart with all your transits too. If you have any questions e-mail me, I'm always happy to help.\n\nP.S I rarely read my chart until the end of the day.

Why the sky is blue? .  . The first steps towards correctly explaining the colour of the sky were taken by John Tyndall in 1859.  He discovered that when light passes through a clear fluid holding small particles in suspension, the shorter blue wavelengths are scattered more strongly than the red.  This can be demonstrated by shining a beam of white light through a tank of water with a little milk or soap mixed in.  From the side, the beam can be seen by the blue light it scatters; but the light seen directly from the end is reddened after it has passed through the tank.  The scattered light can also be shown to be polarised using a filter of polarised light, just as the sky appears a deeper blue through polaroid sun glasses.\n\nThis is most correctly called the Tyndall effect, but it is more commonly known to physicists as Rayleigh scattering--after Lord Rayleigh, who studied it in more detail a few years later.  He showed that the amount of light scattered is inversely proportional to the fourth power of wavelength for sufficiently small particles.  It follows that blue light is scattered more than red light by a factor of (700/400)4 ~= 10	Science & Mathematics

"why does the bird flu considered to be such a frightening disease? . I seem that the entire world is dealing with it- what makes it different then other epidemic diseases? . The 1918, 1957 and and 1968 flu pandemics can be traced back to bird flu mutating with human virus. These pandemics killed scores of people. The panic also stems from the fact that there is no vaccine for H5N1 virus, the bird flu that is currently affecting Asia. Like last year, vaccines for ""regular"" human flu are in short supply as well.\nUnder normal circumstances, when the flu hits you're just feverish, achey and fatigued for a few days. When the flu strikes more vulnerable people, like the elderly and very young babies, it can cause respiratory problems and even kill them."	Health
"Question about filling the W-8BEN form? . I'm a non US citizen or resident. I have a securities account on a stock trading institution..\nI'm from Greece and lately, I've moved to Italy..\nThe security institution asked me to send an updated W-8BEN form with my Greece address as my legal address, and my Italy address as the mailing address. \n\nI got confused on this part n the form:\n""""The beneficial owner is a resident of _________within the meaning of the income tax treaty between the United States and that country.""""\n\nShould I Write resident of Greece or Italy??\nnad is there is something else in the form filling -other than adding my italy address as maling address- would change as i moved to another country? . Step one.  You need an ITIN (Individual Taxpayer Identification Number).  If you don't have one, then you need to get one BEFORE you can send in the W-8BEN.  Get it by filing Form W7 - itself a mighty tricky form.  It takes up to 12 weeks to get a number.  The nice folks at the IRS will give you a hand.\n\nStep two.  You are a resident of Italy.  It's the country you are physically present in, not the one you where you are a citizen.  If you move to a new country, you need to fill in a new W-8BEN.\n\nThe treaty rate is 15% for dividends.  The domestic rate is 0% on interest and 0% on sales of stocks.  Without form W-8BEN, the rate on all three is 30%.  \n\nYou will need to quote the Article number to get the treaty rate.  Dividends is Article 10 of the US/Italy treaty.\n\nAll links included below."	Business & Finance

Superman, on the other hand, has two weaknesses. The first one of course is kryptonite. Hulk probably won't me smart enough to get any of that. His other weakness is that he derives his power from the sun.\n\nBasically, the two of them will go at it for weeks and weeks beating the crap out of each other destroying everything around them- including some nuclear power plants, oil refineries, etc. - until the sky goes entirely black just like in the Matrix.

Will you follow these rules? Pooping @ work 101! Hilarious!!? . Pooping @ work 101\n\nWe have all been there but do not like to admit it. We have all kicked\nback at our desks or cubicles and suddenly felt something brewing down\nthere. As much as we try to convince ourselves otherwise, the WORK POOP is\ninevitable. For those who hate pooping at work, following is the survival\nguide for taking a dump at work:\n\nCROP DUSTING - When farting, you walk really fast around the office so the\nsmell is not in your area and everyone else gets a whiff but doesn't know\nwhere it came from. Be careful when you do this. Do not stop until the\nfull fart has been expelled. Walk an extra 30 feet to make sure the smell\nhas left your pants.\n\nFLY BY - The act of scouting out a bathroom befor e pooping. Walk in and\ncheck for other poopers. If there are others in the bathroom, leave and\ncome back again. Be careful not to become a frequent fly by. People may\nbecome suspicious if they catch you constantly going into the bathroom.\n\nESCAPEE - A fart that slips out while taking a leak at the urinal or\nforcing a poop in the stall. This is usually accompanied by a sudden wave\nof embarrassment. If you release an escapee, do not acknowledge it.\nPretend you did not hear it. No one likes an escapee. It is uncomfortable\nfor all involved. Making a joke or laughing makes both parties feel\nuneasy.\n\nJAILBREAK - When forcing a poop, several farts slip out like a machine gun.\nThis is usually the side effect of diarrhea or a hangover. If this should\nhappen, do not panic. Remain in the stall until everyone has left the\nbathroom to spare everyone the awkwardness of what just occurred.\n\nCOURTESY FLUSH - The act of flushi n g the toilet the instant the poop hits\nthe water. This reduces the amount of airtime the poop has to stink up the\nbathroom. This can help you avoid being caught doing the WALK OF SHAME.\n\nWALK OF SHAME - Walking from the stall, to the sink, then to the door after\nyou have just stunk up the bathroom. This can be very a very uncomfortable\nmoment if someone walks in and busts you. As with farts, it is best to\npretend that the smell does not exist. Can be avoided with the use of the\nCOURTESY FLUSH.\n\nOUT OF THE CLOSET POOPER (O.O.T.C.P.) - A colleague who poops at work and\nis damn proud of it. You will often see a O.O.T.C.P. enter the bathroom\nwith a newspaper or magazine under their arm. Always look around the\noffice for the O.O.T.C.P. before entering a bathroom.\n\nPOOPING FRIENDS NETWORK (P.F.N.) - A group of co-workers who band together\nto ensure emergency pooping goes off without incident. This group can help\nyo u monitor the whereabouts of O.O.T.C.P.'s, and identify SAFE HAVENS.\n\nSAFE HAVENS - A seldom used bathroom somewhere in the building where you\ncan least expect visitors. Try floors that are predominately of the\nopposite sex. This will reduce the odds of a pooper of your sex entering\nthe bathroom.\n\nTURD BURGLAR - Someone who does not realize that you are in the stall and\ntries to force the door open. This is one of the most shocking and\nvulnerable moments that can occur when taking a poop at work. If this\noccurs, remain in the stall until the turd burglar leaves. This way you\nwill avoid all uncomfortable eye contact.\n\nWATERMELON - A poop that creates a loud splash when hitting the toilet\nwater. This is also an embarrassing incident. If you feel a watermelon\ncoming on while someone else is in the bathroom, create a diversion. See\nCAMO-COUGH.\n\nCAMO-COUGH - A phony cough that alerts all new entrants into th e bathroom\nthat you are in a stall. This can be used to cover up a Watermelon, or to\nalert potential Turd Burglars. Very effective when used in conjunction\nwith an ASTAIRE.\n\nASTAIRE - A subtle toe-tap that is also used to alert potential Turd\nBurglars. If you hear an Astaire, leave the bathroom immediately so the\npooper can poop in peace.\n\nHAVANA OMELET - A case of diarrhea that creates a series of loud splashes\nin the toilet water. Of . OMG. This is a riot!! Thanks for all the tips. Maybe I should print them out and slip them in my purse for emergencies???	Entertainment & Music

what's  the best bait for fishing king salmon? .  . Depends on where you are fishing for them. Eggs are fine in the river, but in the ocean a trolled plug cut herring is the way to go. Some people use them with a rubber squid above the bait and a dodger on the line for really good action. The main thing is to cut the herring just behind the gill at a 45 degree angle from top to bottom and an angle from side to side to give it a real big, slow spin. Thread the first hook through to body and hook in the tail and hook the second hook upwards from the indife through the back bone.We also use spoons with no bait at all. Same can be said for inside the mouth of the Columbia.\n\nWhen we used to fish for Salmon in the Sacramento River it was still a long way to spawning areas and the fish wouldn't take eggs. We back trolled flatfish with a herring wrap. Or we trolled large spinning lures or spoons.	Sports

Ok heres the scoop.\ni can flip the board fine i even can get a double flip sometimes=) but i cant get my front foot on the board. i get my back foot on every time. \nbest answer gets 10 points . before you do the ollie lean slightly forewards so your belly button is above or near the center of  the board. that is your center of gravity and you might get a straighter path and go higher, mabey. try minimizing the size of your ollie so that your foot will almost definitly land on the board, since when you try a kickflip you might move your foot up on the board a bit causing a messed up landing	Sports
"give me a biography of jim jones? .  . this is the bio for the rapper Jim Jones: \n\nJim Jones (is an American rapper best known for being a founding member of The Diplomats. He is co-CEO of Diplomat records, which publishes The Diplomats' music, and is no longer director of A&R for Warner Music Group.\n\nHis mother is Aruban and African American while his father is Puerto Rican. He was born in the Taft projects in Harlem, New York. [citation needed] Jones frequently moved as a youth between the Bronx and Harlem.[citation needed] He met Cam'ron while in high school.[citation needed] He often wears a dark pair of sunglasses and rarely shows his eyes at performances or in videos. He is also a member of the 9 Trey Bloods in New York (stated in the It's Okay (One Blood) remix).\nJones has had ties with several other rappers including fellow Harlemites Cam'ron and Freekey Zeekey, Harlem MC Juelz Santana, and Bronx native Hell Rell. He has had problems with some rappers from other neighborhoods, including Harlem rapper Mase, Queensbridge rapper Nas, Lower East Side rapper Tru-Life.\n\nJones' conflict with Tru-Life began when Tru-Life said that Dipset co-founder Cam'ron was ""a bitch"" in an interview with Complex Magazine (see[1]). This comment came about after speculation that Tru-Life was talking about Jones and the Diplomats in his song ""New New York"". Tru-Life then called out the entire Dipset crew at the Puerto Rican Day Parade after-party at The Roxy in New York City. He referred to Jones as Jenny Jones and belittled what he perceived to be the crew's embracing of West Coast Hip-Hop and Southern Rap.\n\nJones responded by challenging Tru-Life to a fight with US$50,000 at stake ([2]). Tru-Life accepted the challenge, but he didn't put up the money or anything for the whole month . This beef is related somewhat to the dispute between Cam'ron and Jay-Z as Tru Life is signed to Jay's Roc La Familia label. Jim Jones has also dissed Jay-Z numerous times, in songs such as ""Alarm"" and ""Kingdom Done"", featuring Damon Dash. The later song is a reference to Jay-Z's Kingdom Come album, or the song of the same name.\n\nJim Jones is also best friends with Kevin Rios aka Big Papi. Big Papi is due to release a mixtape early next year."	Entertainment & Music
What is the penalty for vehicular manslaughter? . A friend of mine was speeding and rearended some one who suddenly slammed on his brakes on the freeway. The man that received the impact died on the scene. Initially, he wasn't charged with anything, but six months later, (which is now), He is being charged with manslaughter. What are his options and what is he facing? . Vehicular manslaughter is a statutory crime for which the elements and the possible penalties vary from state to state.  \n\nSomebody has your state's vehicle and penal codes on-line, a simple search will get you the answer.  If your friend tells you the Code and Code Section he's charged with, you can zero right in on the answer.  \n\nSome states even set out the minimum and maximum penalty in the criminal complaint.\n\nHe has only two options:  One, if he is eligible have the public defender represent him.  Two, hire a private attorney.  \n\nRepresenting himself is slow suicide.  Pleading guilty at arraignment without counsel advising him is equally stupid.	Politics & Government

How do you stuff wedding invitations? .  . There are usually 6 components to a wedding invitation:  the RSVP card, the RSVP envelope pre-printed with your address, a sheet of tissue paper, the invitation itself, an inside envelope and an outside envelope.  Put the RSVP card under the flap of the RSVP envelope.  Put that with the tissue paper inside of the invitation (if it opens).  If not, then layer the RSVP card tucked inside the RSVP envelope flap on top of the tissue paper on top of the invitation and place all face up into the inside envelope.  DO NOT SEAL.  On the face of the envelope, write the names of all of the people at that address who will be invited (i.e., Mr. & Mrs. Smith, Sue & Mary; or John Smith & Guest).  Place this inside the outside envelope with the writing facing the opening and the top of the inside envelope the same as the outside envelope.  Address the outside envelope with formalities (i.e. Mr. John Smith; Mr. & Mrs. Smith and family).  Don't forget to put a stamp on the RSVP envelope.  Also - remember - it's etiquette to write out everything in full on the outside envelope (no abbreviations)\n\nCongratulations on your wedding!	Family & Relationships
"why a wet area of any fabric or paper appear darker than the drier area? .  . Because the color of any object which does not emit light is really due to the effect of reflection, there are various ways in which color is ""generated"".\n\nThe color spectrum is Red, Orange, Yellow, Green, Blue, Indigo and Violet.  Because the light emitted by the Sun is most intense in the Yellow part of the spectrum, we see Yellow as the brightest ""color"".  Go in any direction away from Yellow and we see darker and darker colors. \n\nWe see the color of an object as the summation of the light that is reflected by that object.  When a piece of cloth or paper is wet, it absorbs water which fills in the spaces between the fibers.  Water reflects mostly in the blue spectrum, so that adds to the total light which is reflected by the object.  This added blue light makes the total light appear ""darker"" to us since it ""drags"" the spectrum of refelcted light away from Yellow."	Science & Mathematics
"who started judaism and when and where did judaism start? .  . Judaism's answer is that Gd started Judaism when He revealed Himself to Abraham, entered into a covenant with Abraham, and continued to re-establish, and reaffirm that same covenant with Abe's son Isaac, again with Isaac's son Jacob, and then again through Jacob's 12 sons who became the 12 tribes, and then again with their descendants, the entire Jewish people, through Moses at Mt. Sinai, and on and on through Jewish history. \n\nMark Twain wrote:  """"The Egyptian, the Babylonian, and the Persian rose, filled the planet with sound and splendor, then . . . passed away. The Greek and the Roman followed. The Jew saw them all, beat them all, and is now what he always was, exhibiting no decadence, no infirmities of age, no weakening of his parts. â¦ All things are mortal but the Jew; all other forces pass, but he remains. What is the secret of his immortality?"""" The answer to Twain's question, What is the secret of his immortality is that Judaism was started by Gd."	Business & Finance

"Outline the rules for creating CSMA/CD network access including the need to limit cable distances? .  . Defining SSMA/CD...\nShort for Carrier Sense Multiple Access / Collision Detection, a set of rules determining how network devices respond when two devices attempt to use a data channel simultaneously (called a collision). Standard Ethernet networks use CSMA/CD to physically monitor the traffic on the line at participating stations. If no transmission is taking place at the time, the particular station can transmit. If two stations attempt to transmit simultaneously, this causes a collision, which is detected by all participating stations. After a random time interval, the stations that collided attempt to transmit again. If another collision occurs, the time intervals from which the random waiting time is selected are increased step by step. This is known as exponential back off. \nCSMA/CD is a type of contention protocol.  Networks using the CSMA/CD procedure are simple to implement but do not have deterministic transmission characteristics. The CSMA/CD method is internationally standardized in IEEE 802.3 and ISO 8802.3. \n\nCable distances are limited to 100m for cat 5 cableing which includes the length of the run as well as the patch cable lengths...Any longer is strongly not recommended, as it causes a ""lag"" time for transmitting data that results in a conflict as indicated in the info above!"

Has anyone had a child had a seizure for no reason at all? . My daughter had a seizure and the doctors can't find nothing wrong with her. They have taken 17 viles of blood,urine,they have done cat scans, x-rays and other test and still came up with nothing. If you have any info. PLEASE HELP !!! . yes, my daughter has suffered with this since she was 6, for 7 years medication controlled the seizures, and for the last 3, for no apparent reason, the medication has lost much of it's effectiveness, even though she has been on several. she has had 3 mri's, a pet scan, and ct's, which all show nothing abnormal. however, the eeg, and video eeg all show a right side focus, but cannot pinpoint where or why it happens. it could be something organic in her brain to begin with, or possibly hereditary, as my niece has also had seizures. it can be very frustrating when there is no apparent reason for the seizures, be it something organic or an injury. i'm sure by now you have seen a neurologist, and if it is an ongoing thing, i would discuss medication with him, and the medication is effective in 98% of people with epilepsy. good luck, the best thing is to be there for her, and help her through this.

What do you think abou the construction of a massive wall between the U.S and Mexico? .  . It's about freakin time! Illegal Aliens cost the US billions of dollars a year. Yes that's right billions with a B. Think about it. Millions of impoverished, uneducated, people pour into a country of higher living standards. What happens? Tax dollars (that means money that you and I work hard for and is supposed to go towards making life better of everyone) now have to be set aside to pay for social programs like wefare checks, food stamps, government housing, medical care ect for all these people who broke our laws by sneaking into the country with their hands out. Then when they start having all the kids then even more tax money has to be spent not to mention the overcrowed schools which by the way fall drastically in test scores because Hispanic people in general don't give a rats ass about education or learing english. Unlike other immigrants from other countries, Hispanics for whatever reason just cannot bring themselves to pull themselves upward. So the burden to support all these people falls on us taxpayers. Now maybe some of you don't mind the Socialist way the government is taking your hard earned money and giving it to people who have no right to be here but most of the country sees the problems it's creating. Just look at SoCal, Arizona and Texas. For illegal immigration to be stopped three things need to happen:\n\n1) Cut off all tax funded social programs for illegals.\n\n2) Start going after businesses that hire illegals and fine the daylights out of them.\n\n3) Get rid of the law that grants citizenship to babies born on American soil to non-citizens. This will end the anchor baby epidemic.\n\noh yeah and a 4th: Build a wall at the boarder and put the military to patrol.\nTrust me, the costs of doing this will be far cheaper then having to pay the living expenses for most of a poor country. Mexico has to get the message that it can no longer dump it's massive poverty problem on us.	Politics & Government

Monarchies are more stable than democracies? . I would disagree with your claim that Monarchies are more stable. \n\nLook at Nepal, it's falling apart... the reason why one might think that Monarchies are more stable is that they are less frequent and therefore thier demise doesn't register in our memory compared to the collapse of Democratic systems.\n\nDid you know that Egypt was a monarchy for instance? and like the previous person who answered, many countries, including China were also monarchies? \n\nI believe that Monarchy System of Government is just like any other system, if the people are happy with it, it will will prosper, it not, then it would eventualy collapse. \n\nBesides, most of those countries you mentioned have no reason to be unstable, they're well-managed and thier people are living in relative ease.

if someone has the same bmi does that mean they are the same skinniness? .  .

What is the real reason why Tony from the show Girlfriends (UPN now CW) left? .  . I have posted this answer before but since Girlfriends is my favorite show, I have no problem sharing the information.\n\nI posted this answer recently for someone else's question but I hope this helps you out.\n\nI read that when UPN and WB merged, Girlfriends was not sure if they would be picked up for another season. Jill Marie Jones (Toni) decided not to return back to the show no matter if the show was picked up by the CW or not. I also read on another website but not quite sure how true it is, that the reason she is not returning is because the time had come for all 4 women to negotiate their contracts. They decided amongst themselves that they would only accept a certain offer and if the company tried to low-ball them, they would all refuse (sort of like the cast of Seinfield and Friends). Supposedly Jill Marie declined the low offer just like the others said they would but come to find out the others accepted theirs which left Jill Marie out in the dust. Which ever story is accurate I am not quite sure but what is true is that as of now she is not returning as a regular cast member.\n\nHopefully they will continue to negotiate her contract and maybe she will return sometime in the season. I'll even be satisfied if she does some guest appearances but I know that the show won't be the same without her. Also from watching the last few episodes, it doesn't look like the show will be as interesting as it was when she was on there. I am still upset with the whole CW lineup, I want my Half & Half and Toni back on Girlfriends!!! Sorry, I just had to get that out, LOL.	Entertainment & Music

Do you wear contacts?  If so, what cleansing solution do you use? . My contacts have been bothering my eyes...I think I might need to change solutions.  Could be allergies too. . I've used Renu and Opti-free.  My eye doctor says it's a good idea to pick a brand and stick with it.  Switching around (like I'd originally done based on what was cheapest) can irritate your eyes.\n\nAlso, using eye drops without preservatives can be helpful, too.  GenTeal is one brand I really like.  Not sure if Refresh preservative-free, but they helped me when I wore contacts.  \n\nIt might be dry eyes in general.  So, you can get two kinds of drops...one for use with contacts lenses while they're in your eyes, and one for use without contacts for just before you put them in, or just after you take them out.

"Does anyone else have a hard time making close friends and have they overcome shyness? . I am a really good person. but I have never had many friends and find it really hard to make a close connection to people even though I would love to have a lot of good friends. People always just stop talking to me at some point. I am attractive, nice, intelligent, funny and fun loving and put myself out for people I like.\nJust wondering if anyone else has this problem. . I find that my self conscienceness doesn't allow me to trust many.  I am 35 and still very quiet and shy.  Close friends are very far and few between.

"Shoghi Effendi about Joseph Smith? .  . ShoghÃ­ EffendÃ­ RabbÃ¡nÃ­ (March 1, 1897 - November 4, 1957), better known as Shoghi Effendi, was the Guardian of the BahÃ¡'Ã­ Faith from 1921 until his death.\n\nAfter the passing of `Abdu'l-BahÃ¡ in 1921, the leadership of the BahÃ¡'Ã­ community entered a new phase, evolving from that of a single individual to an administrative order founded on the ""twin pillars"" of the Guardianship and the Universal House of Justice, being the executive and legislative branches.\n\nShoghi Effendi is not regarded as one of the Central Figures of the BahÃ¡'Ã­ Faith. Whereas the works of the three Central Figures constitute the source of the BahÃ¡'Ã­ Faith, Shoghi Effendi's writings are effectively limited to commentaries on the works of the Central Figures.\n\nJoseph Smith is considered by members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints to be a prophet, seer, and revelator.\n\nShoghi Effendi thought Joseph Smith was a seer, but not a prophet.\n\nIt is not known what Joseph Smith (martyred in 1844) thinks of Shoghi Effendi."

"What are the similarities and differences do you see between a MLB and a Minor League Baseball game? .  . Similarities:\n1. Rule-wise and strategy-wise, it's the same game. \n\nDifferences:\n1. More intensity - some might say that this is just from personal observance, but there's a lot of common sense to back it up: players are literally competing for major league jobs (or, trying to get back to the majors), in addition to trying to win games. Plus, ""fringe"" players know that their attitude alone can make all the difference when call-up time comes.\n2. Faster pace - since a large majority of minor league games are not televised, there aren't the usual hold-ups that you see with the majors.\n3. Atmosphere - the crowds are smaller, but oftentimes much more knowledgeable and ""into"" the game than crowds in the majors. This is due to the fact that they are educated as to the organizational structure of a ballclub, as opposed to just a local team roster.\n3. Better bang for the buck - ticketprices are cheaper, and you get a more intense game of baseball, and the mistakes that are made are those of inexperience rather than laziness, as in the majors. Plus, you get alot of fun extras, like between-inning bingo games, raffles, in-the-stands entertainment, and fun on-field contests. They are largely promoted as local/community events, rather than large sport gatherings.\n\nAnd lastly: the minors emphasize development...so players have advancement as their *immediate* motivation rather than money, and the fans generally are more into the team and community than star-oriented."

can raise a women's interest in you? i mean what if you ask her question's about herself, what will that do .  . You need to tell her as much about you as she tells you about her. Keep it about 50:50. If she asks you a question, you might want to ask a similar one back.\n\nDon't be afraid to let her know things about you. How can you become friends if she doesn't know anything about you? Just avoid anything negative or contraversial that would spoil the positive mood. Take it slow, don't tell her your whole life story on your first meeting.\n\nYour questions don't have to be directly about yourselves, such as job or where you're from, etc, just  tastes and interests. For example, if she says 'What did you think of the new james bond movie?', tell her, then say 'Did you like it?', 'What do you like about it?'.\n\nAsk questions that open up the conversation, such as 'How did you get into hairdressing?' (or whatever) and questions that invite her to go into a long story, such as 'Did you do anything nice this summer?'. Keep it going with follow-up questions.\n\nSearch for articles or yahoo questions on small-talk. The book on small-talk below is very good. When you've broken the ice and got to know a bit about each other, move it on by flirting (see link).	Family & Relationships

Can Japan beat West in Animation Industry Within 10 years ahead? .

More than likly the east will win; in the western animation industrys like Disney Dreamworks, Fox and WB are try to concentrate on CGI films ever sinc Toy Story came out the weatern animation has lost it touch, no one remember Treasure Planet, Titan AE, Ultimate Avangers, and few talk about Brother Bear, and other recant animated films in the U.S.; way, because everyone is focused on CGI films like The Incredables, Bugs Life, Ants, Final Fantasy etc. However movies like Spirited Away and anime shows like Naruto,  Cowboy Bebop, and Fullmetal Alchemist are very popular and are growing very fast, even faster then shows like Family Guy, and the Simpsons. The bottom line is estern animation has better stories and good plots and there animation is getting better and better every year. In about 5 years they probably will have much better animatied films than there western rivels. Which is why american animaitor are looking to work together with eastern animators in makeing shows like Big O and IGPX, or something even better. In the mean time america will be more into CGI films than animatied ones.	Entertainment & Music

"i just heard that Jews do not claim satan to be evil. is this true? . pardon my ignorance, i dont know much about Judaism . This is true for the most part.  Jews get this from the Bible itself, which portrays the Satan (the Adversary in Hebrew) as merely an obedient angel.  The book of Job describes his function very well.  \n\nAnother good piece of evidence for the Jewish view of Satan is the fact that in the book of Kings, it is said that David was urged by God to do a census.  But in Chronicles, it is instead said that it was Satan who urged him.  The Jewish understanding of this is simply that Satan was the agent who carried it out as one of God's angels.  But God is ultimately in control of all.\n\nIsaiah 45 I believe says that the LORD creates evil and good, the LORD does all these things.  The word for ""evil"" is sometimes translated as ""destruction"" but the word in the original Hebrew is literally evil.  It's the word Ra = bad, evil.\n\nThe idea of Satan as the opposite of God is too dualistic for Judaism, which is a purer monotheism than Christianity.  Christianity is closer to the dualistic Zoroastrianism than to Judaism on this matter."	Society & Culture

"My friend and her husband are swingers? . My friend and her husband are swingers!!  I just found this out!! It's not something I would do!  Do you think people do that as a legal way a cheating!! . My wife and I have an extremely happy marriage.\n\nSwinging is not a ""legal"" method to cheat.\n\nSwingers have the ability to:\na) separate sex from love  and\nb) openly communicate their wishes, desires and fantasies to their partner.\n\nThere are as many types of swinging as there are swingers, some are exhibitionistic and like to have sexual play strictly between themslevs but like the added thrill of others watching.\n\nSome are voyeurs, and fit nicely with the aforementioned group.\n\nSome have special ""friends with benefits"" who they not only participate in sexual play with, but also go to movies, and dinner, vacations, play cards, have bar-b-ques, etc.\n\nSome have what might oddly be termed ""monogamous"" relationships with a third or another couple with whom they play exclusively.\n\nCertainly there is a percentage of the culture that are ""serial swingers"". My wife and I refer to them as the ""notch on a bedpost crowd"" who seemingly play with anyone and everyone, they are definitely in the minority.\n\nSwinging has dramatically improved our marriage for a couple of reasons - first, it absolutely requires honest, open discussions and conversations, and anytime a couple improves their ability to communicate with their spouse it will help the marriage. Second, we do not worry about affairs and cheating, there is no need for it, if one of us is attracted to someone else, we simply talk about it and decide as a couple whether we will pursue an opportunity to play with that person/people. Third, our sex lives have improved for a multitude of reasons or sex with each other is better and more frequent now.\n\nFeel free to contact me with questions you may have and I would also recommend that following sites for more information on the lifestyle and culture.\n\nhttp://www.swinglesonline.com\nhttp://www.theswingersforum.com\nhttp://www.swingersboard.com"	Family & Relationships

"Do Christians think  that Christ is the only way to heaven & all others go to hell? . I have heard many say this, especially those of the born again fundamentalist churches.  Do any of you really believe this? If so, why *but no biblical quotes, please, as I've heard them already* ?  And remember, this is just a question.  There is no need to lose your head over it. . Noone can know that.\n\nUnfortunately, the Bible, reputedly given as the word to bring all persons to god & the christ figure, tells us not to believe any human teaching us that it is the word, that it's god is the One True Creator God, that Jesus is part of God and came to Earth to die for our salvation, and that the Holy Spirit is part of its god and the part that will enter you to let you know the Bible is the Word and the Truth.  \n\nRead on.\n\nWe can't know a ""god"", and can neither prove nor disprove what the currently referenced Bibles tell us (Referring to the modern-day, Christian mainstream belief that the Old Testament and New Testaments, as interpreted and popularly bound, make up the Word for us to receive).\n\nIt's an impossible connundrum. To know Christ, or God's love is one thing. But, to learn it by introduction to, and understanding of the Word as an ""In"" is impossible. Questions aimed at deficiencies, conflicts and historic errors must be explained away by interpretation.\n\nHowever, Jesus tells his readers, directly, not to follow charismatics, ritual or leaders of this earth. Everyone that is brought to Christ by witnesses or other humans faces a very real problem. Being brought to him, or introduced, means one has not met Christ and does not know his father or the Holy Spirit. The student then will be required to follow a teacher of this world.\n\nWithin his teachings, a True teacher would have to teach the student Jesus' direct warning about following worldly leaders/teachers. The student then cannot know whether his teacher is of this world (getting the fine details wrong and leading poor student astray), or from the right school of thought.\n\nthe student will need the Holy Spirit to enter him, so Christianity tells us, in order to understand the word. For any man can pick up the Bible and start putting together messages that serve his purpose by stringing passages together. Even well-meaning, but very misled persons can do this.\n\nThe student would have to come to know the Holy Spirit by following the worldly leader in order to accept the Holy Spirit and invite him into the student so that the student can know whether or not his teacher is a True teacher or one of this world.\n\nOf course, a good student, and one who has never been brought to Christ, would have to put the mental brakes on when they get to the point in the lessons where they are taught not to follow worldly leaders and teachers. A good student will have to say to himself:\n1. I'm being introduced to this alleged one, true, god by this person.\n\n2. This person tells me that there is one, true, god who created us and everything and loves us and chooses us and gave us his Word to know him.\n\n3. This person tells me that god's word is the Bible.\n\n4. This person tells me that the Bible says that it is god's word.\n\n5. This person tells me that the word is also jesus as we know him through the Bible.\n\n6. This person tells me that the word is truth.\n\n7. This person tells me that I have to believe in jesus, accept him as my lord and savior to be with god forever.\n\n8. This person tells me that jesus died for my sins, which otherwise separate me from god and had previously required priests to make various sacrifices to cleanse me to god.\n\n9. This person tells that we all have sin and must have this relationship with jesus, and live as he instructs, to be tight with god.\n\n10. This person tells me that there is an entity called satan, an anti-god, that exists to confuse me, lead me away from god and jesus, and take me down the wrong, worldly path.\n\n11. This person tells me Jesus demanded we not follow charismatics, worldly teachers or leaders, nor earthly ritual.\n\n12. This person responds to my earnest question about confusing points of the Bible and his (my earthly teacher's) message by telling me I will know the word is the Word, and the Truth through the Holy Spirit.\n"	Society & Culture

What are, FATHER, MOTHER and SPRITE in our religion ( Christianity )? .  . Father is God the creator, Mother is our earthly Mom, and Sprite is a wealthy soda pop company - however the Holy spirit is a part of God the Father, God the Son, and God the Holy Spirit that makes up one unity called the Trinity - for those who practice a religion that believes in a Holy Mother, they are not Christian believing - for true Christian believe only in the relationship of accepting Jesus Christ as their personal Lord and Savior and do not need his mother to speak on our behalf, as she was just a woman as  I am, a chosen vessel to do the work of God.

And futhermore, increasing the omnipotent powers of the U.S through arms loans is not worth it either. Human lives are not worth it. Speaking of which, the lastest count on the number killed in the war in Iraq is horrible. But that number is infanitly smaller than the number of unreported deaths of Iraqi CIVILIANS. The U.S went to war to fight terrorism. This is hypocritical because the U.S supports and trains terrorists. Its used to be called the School of Americas and is now called Western Hemisphere Institute for Security Cooperation and its located in Fort Benning, Georgia. The school actually distributes manuals and textbooks on torture and violence. SOA has trained over 60,000 Latin American soldiers in counterinsurgency techniques, sniper training, commando and psychological warfare, military intelligence and interrogation tactics. These graduates have consistently used their skills to wage a war against their own people including the majority of the dictators of South America including Pinochet. Hundreds of thousands of Latin Americans have been tortured, raped, assassinated, âdisappeared,â massacred, and forced into refugee by those trained at the School of Assassins.	Society & Culture

Can i know what exactly is the working procedure of a credit card?? Cant people indulge in foul play?? . I mean to say many a times the signature that we do is not even verified with the signature present on the back of the card.Even if i present a fake signature the card is going to work. Also another thing is that, can it happen, say in a restaurant, where the card is not swapped in front of you, that the person concerned swaps the card twice. he keeps one copy secretly to himself. Takes our signature on the official copy and then copies the signature on the copy that he had hidden with himself. this is really dangerous. does it work??? if yes how? if no how?? . That is one reason you have to look at your statement each and every month when it comes and make sure that you have made the purchase.. if not then get in touch with your company.. they will not make you pay for items that you did not buy.. never leave your credit card bill laying on the table at a restaurant either, always make sure the server picks it up before you leave, you are just asking for trouble, anyone can pick that up .. most places now are just showing the last 4 numbers of your credit card on the bill , but some are not.. for the most part people are honest, but there are people out there that are going to take advantage of us.. you just never know.. it is just the chance we all take.. most times they are to busy to get your info off the card.. or to double swipe.. and it would do them no good to double swipe in a restaurant.. are they going to eat the same thing you did?? don't think so.. just always make sure you get your card back in a store, and by law you do not have to sign your card !!! you do have to have a picture ID on you to prove it is your card.. anyone can sign your card.. make them look at a picture ID to make sure it is your card...

why do some people have pain in stomach during mensuration? is that anything to do with vagina hole size? .  . >>>>>>why do some people have pain in stomach during \n>>>>>> mensuration?\n\nThat's pretty complicated to answer, but there are two broad reasons. The first is that menstruation itself is the result of the surface of the uterus pealing off. Not surprisingly that is painful for many women.\n\nThe second is that hormonal changes prior to and during menstruation affect the smooth muscle of not just the uterus but the entire digestive tract and the circulatory system. That leads to spasms or 'cramping' of the uterus as well as of the stomach and gut generally.\n\nBTW if a woman has sever pain during and especially following menstruation a visit to the doctor is recommended.\n\n>>>>is that anything to do with vagina hole size?\n\nNope, totally unrelated.

What is the Catholic Churches views on Autism? .  . Two parts: Practical and theological.\n\nFirst, the theology. Autism is an illness or a disease. In a perfect world, there'd be no illnesses and no diseases - but because of the breach between Human and God (a breach caused by the state of sin) we've been made vulnerable to the elements, including to sicknesses. So Autism is a consequence of sin. That's NOT to say that because someine is autistic, that they must have committed some grievious sin. Rather, it's that the FIRST HUMANS committed a grievious sin, and we all pay the price for that in different ways.\n\nPractically speaking, the Catholic Church regards illnesses as opportunities to overcome temptations (the temptation to give up, the temptation to be angry because of our weaknesses, and the temptation of others to treat us unkindly because of the burden we represent). But any medical condition has no bearing on the relationship of the individual to the Church, or to salvation, or to God.\n\n... However, also practically speaking, it may be difficult to find a bishop who would ordain an autistic man to the priesthood, depending on the seriousness of the individual's situation.

"What causes an appendix to rupture? . I went to the ER and they admitted me right away. The next day I was told that my appendix ruptured and that if i had waited one more day I would have been dead. They drained my appendix and they want to take it out in a few weeks, but I would not want it to rupture and go through that again befor they do. . Appendicitis is inflammation of the appendix. It is thought that appendicitis begins when the opening from the appendix into the cecum becomes blocked. The blockage may be due to a build-up of thick mucus within the appendix or to stool that enters the appendix from the cecum. The mucus or stool hardens, becomes rock-like, and blocks the opening. This rock is called a fecalith (literally, a rock of stool). At other times, the lymphatic tissue in the appendix may swell and block the appendix. Bacteria which normally are found within the appendix then begin to invade (infect) the wall of the appendix. The body responds to the invasion by mounting an attack on the bacteria, an attack called inflammation. (An alternative theory for the cause of appendicitis is an initial rupture of the appendix followed by spread of bacteria outside the appendix.. The cause of such a rupture is unclear, but it may relate to changes that occur in the lymphatic tissue that line the wall of the appendix.)\n\nIf the inflammation and infection spread through the wall of the appendix, the appendix can rupture. After rupture, infection can spread throughout the abdomen; however, it usually is confined to a small area surrounding the appendix (forming a peri-appendiceal abscess).\n\nSometimes, the body is successful in containing (""healing"") the appendicitis without surgical treatment if the infection and accompanying inflammation do not spread throughout the abdomen. The inflammation, pain and symptoms may disappear. This is particularly true in elderly patients and when antibiotics are used. The patients then may come to the doctor long after the episode of appendicitis with a lump or a mass in the right lower abdomen that is due to the scarring that occurs during healing. This lump might raise the suspicion of cancer."	Health

I've noticed that before in the past, however I have never been able to pin point the reason.  I cannot find anything on the web addressing this issue, so I thought I'd ask the question in case you can be of any help.  Thanks much! . It's the vitamins. When you take vitamins, your body will process the vitamins and minerals you need to extract from the pill(s), then you liver and kidneys will flush out the excess, and the end result is usually bright neon yellow urine, as well as a smell. If you are having any other symptoms, please see a doctor, it could be something other than your vitamins, and could be microscopically destroying your reproductive organs, or a bladder infection."

Are you surprised good food school dinners are not popular? . UK School Dinners:  It was a good idea - improving the menus of school dinners, but I think it was a stupid idea to introduce new menus across all age groups!  It should have been introduced over a period of years, starting with 'Reception' [age 4] every year for the next 12 years.  Young people are much more determined to get what they want these days, so leave the older ones to make their own decision about what they eat - educate them about good food, so they can make a considered decision.  Schools don't get the funding to prepare healthy food meals, so introduce the funding year by year.  A measure of fat index and state of health [blood pressure, exercise tolerance, weight ratio etc] for those who are overweight or obese should be available for those who want help with their eating habits.  What do you think? . Have also just read the headline. Firstly, I'm not surprised school dinners are not popular. You mention phasing in, someone else mentioned the diet kids have been brought up on etc. Trouble is, with such a topical subject the level of demand for a quick fix in Govt circles is not surprising...careers, elections et al. To really solve the issue (vs fix-it), deeper routed issues need also to be addressed - convenience food culture, disappearance of family meals and family unit, support for working women etc. Pretty complex set of variables. More focus on a number of pilot schools to ensure a workable model is my recommendation. \nSecondly, 100% support for Jamie and his initiative. The man works from the heart and head rather than his bank balance. Lastly, I think Yahoo reporters need to be taken to task (as indeed should their counterparts) for sensationalist headlining. They way it is written amounts to negative publicity.	Health

"what impact does pseudoscience have on consumers? .  . There is a huge volume of ""pseudoscience"" in our world, due mostly to marketing efforts. While it can be detected in every consumer advertising campaign in existence to some degree, it is especially prevalent in the hair care industry.\n\nShampoo and conditioner manufacturers make some of the wildest claims of pseudoscience imaginable. They make their products sound like high-tech miracles that revolutionize haircare in order to impress the masses into buying it. Some of their claims are simply empty words that have no basis in the way physics, biology, and chemistry work. \n\nConsumers often fall for the amazing claims because they lack the background to understand the reality and deal with such claims critically. The impact? Sales based on misleading information like the claims of the snake oil vendors of yester-year. Fortunately FDA and other consumer protection mechanisms help prevent potentially damaging lies. The damage dealt by hair care pseudoscience is largely confined to the bank account rather than the body."	Science & Mathematics
"*HEAVEN* Do you want to know about HEAVEN & what it's REALLY like???? . If we all have a spirit/soul...when the body ceases and the spirit/soul is no longer being contained by an identifiable being, everything endured in this Lifetime will be washed away & erased. That's HEAVEN. When you know about what is good and evil, you have the power to do either one. Now multily that by each and every living/dead person in this world. From Adam & Eve until now this is how bad we've become of ourselves: Jealousy, being Scared, doing Crimes against one another, Destroying peoples relationships, Dishonor, Distrust, Trashing our Earth, Doing unto others as you defintately wouldn't want done unto YOU....And to live in FEAR and FALSEHOOD is worse than DEATH. When we die, I believe that everything will be erased & ""reset"". When you truely do not know what is good and what is evil, you will never do wrong. You wouldn't ever get worried or scared because that is a product of evil. THINK ABOUT IT. When you expire the weight of the world will be lifted, LITERALLY! THATS HEAVEN . Very Interesting.\n\nBut then again, that ""heaven"" cannot be felt, cannot be appreciated fully because we do not know what is good or bad. It's more like nothingness, more like emptiness without anything feelings or choice.\n\nLet's look at another perspective of ""Heaven"". The fulfilling heaven. Glorious Heaven. Heaven which only fits as the dwelling place of God. It will be with the knowing and realization of all the worst of things like jealousy, fear, crime, destroying relationships, dishonor, distrust, trashing earth, falsehood and everything evil...etc BUT we were lifted from all these, protected, purified, kept close to the One we trust most and more, we were lavish with happiness and quality richness. (may not necessarily be material richness). Heaven is actually a state of God's Majesty.\nFollowing this definition, to be in Heaven simply means to be in God.\n\nIt's like why don't God make everybody love Him. Why give everyone free will to choose to love him or to go against.\n\nI believe to get a genuine love can only come with free will to choose. Only with that comes genuine love.\n\nI cannot imagine how good can it be if there is no free will and God just made everyone love Him automatically.\n\nSo, what do you think? Is this a better Heaven?"	Society & Culture
"what are dual core and quad core processors? . What are dual core and quad core processors? What impacts and differences would they make as compared to the past processor? . I'll try to keep this simple...\n\nThe processor is the primary ""computing"" part of the computer.\n\nThe vast majority of computers have a ""single core"" processor.  The thing runs so fast for most applications that when doing multiple applications, such as opening up several windows/programs, it appears as if everything is happening at the same time.  But, in reality, it is doing what is called, ""multitasking.""  The processor gives some time to this application, sort of puts a bookmark where it left off, goest to the next application, sort of puts a book mark where it left off, etc., until each process has had a share of time, then it goes back to the book mark of the first process, and the cycle continues.\n\nDual core processors are capable of true parallel processing, which means doing 2 applications at the same time.  To effectively use this, the operating system and software have to be able to perform this.  Windows XP can do it, but again, the application software needs the ability.\n\nQuad core processors means 4 parallel processes running simultaneously.  The same considerations are given to the operating system and software capabilities.\n\nBoth dual and quad processors have all the processors on the same chip, which means things execute quicker than if there are 2 or more separate processors on the same motherboard.  It takes longer to process with separate processors because the information has to run on the system bus, with speed limitations due to several factors.  \n\nI hope this helps."	Computers & Internet

How do small cities work? ie: The addresses and layouts I am writing a story that has a small town.? . I need to be able to give my people address and I need to know where to place city hall, resturants, ect. And things like the sewage treatment plant does every small town have one? . I grew up in a small town and street go north and south or east and west no weird curvy subdivisions. There is the main street that has all of the businesses on it. Post office, library, bank, restaurants, and bars and is usually a state highway. Schools and churches aren't normally located on the main street but some times are. Small town usually have ways they name there streets too. After founders, trees, presidents, etc. The sewage treatment plant (yes little town have them) is located outside of town usually a mile or less. I lived on a north street and some time the person that lived on the south part would get my ups packages but not my mail because you have to pick it up at the post office. Hope this helped.\nYou can also use google earth	Business & Finance

"what are the qualifications of an audit opinion in a companys 10-k? .  . Are you referring to when the audit opinion in a 10-K is a ""qualified opinion"".  The basis of that description is as follows -- the SEC requires that publicly traded companies have an external auditor audit their year end financials in cluded in the 10-K.  Now, with the advent of SOX, the audit opinion includes both a statement that the financials included in the 10-K are materially accurate and that the companies' internal controls are effective (this second part is new and as a result of Sarbanes Oxley).\n\nNormally this is all that is included and, when given, constitutes an ""unqualified"" opinion.  This is the bulk of audit opinions.  If, however, the auditor is forced to conclude, upon review of the books that either (1) in some sense it can not state that the books are materially accurate or (2) the books are accurate but indicate that the company is in danger of going out of business, it must note that in its letter.  This opinion, that there is either the potential for material mistatement, or there is a concern for whether the company can continue, results in a ""qualified opinion.""  You can see examples of that just by typing in ""qualified opinion"" and ""10-K"" in Yahoo, which will bring up search results of this."	Business & Finance
"Is there a good tool for converting PDF docs to 'Accessible' HTML? . Looking for a tool to do a reasonable first past at conversion. All the tools I've seen so far make a mess of tables - I'm particularly interested in a way of automating the conversion of data tables. . Adobe never designed Acrobat to be a source format, so it can be difficult extracting data from them. I routinely do this to get information into Microsoft word, and no matter what I try, it usually messes up the tables at least a little, if not a lot.\n\nThere are 3 main tools I use. If you have Acrobat Professional, you can select ""save as word file"" and it will save the document as a word file... usually with messed up margins, columns, etc.\n\nYou can also use a program caled PDF 2 Office, whisch makes the same kind of conversion. Sometimes the tables come out better, sometimes not.\n\nThe last resort is using OmniPage or other OCR software. This is the only way if the PDF was created from a scan and not from a text file. The advantage of this one is that it handles tables better in most cases, at least keeping the majority of the data organized correctly. Sometimes it will misinterpret things like merged cells or divide a cell in half, but all the data should be in the correct location. The advantage of this is that your table is more visually accurate, the disadvantage for me is that when I take that to use in my document, some extensive cleanup work is required to make it meet our company standards. how well it works will depend on the size and complexity of your tables.\n\nOne other option to consider is Adobe Illustrator. It opens created (as opposed to scanned) PDFs beautifully. The downside is that it was never designed to output html. You will be able to access all the data and to have all the formatting retained virtually perfectly though. How to get it out of Illustrator into html though..  that would be your problem. I know you can output as SVG, but I suspect that you would prefer not to have your tables handled like graphics.\n\nPersonally I think OmniPage is your best bet. Once you have the table in Word, you can save as HTML and make further edits and adjustments from there."	Computers & Internet

"Bad Credit? . I have bad credit, and filed for bankruptcy about a year ago, and have always wanted to go back to school, what are my options? . Two of the major Federal Student loan programs -- Stafford and Perkins -- are unique in that they require absolutely NO credit check. In fact, Financial Aid Administrators are forbidden from checking your credit as a condition for receiving these loans. You don't even need to show financial need to obtain an Unsubsidized Stafford Loan -- as long as your school is accredited, you are enrolled at least half-time as a regular student, and your other financial aid doesn't exceed your Cost of Attendance, you will be offered a Stafford Loan.  To apply, just file your FAFSA online at http://ww.fafsa.ed.gov and your school will determine your eligibility before sending you an award letter.\n\nSince you have filed for bankruptcy, you wil find it difficuly to be approved for private student loans through private lenders (i.e. Citibank, Citizens, Bank of America).  The easiest way around this is to apply with a cosigner -- their credit will act as a sort of ""stand in"" for yours.  (Some borrowers have a tough time getting a friend or family member to co-sign their loan, since, technically, the cosigner is responsible for the loan payments if you aren't good about keeping up with your payments.  However, you can seek out a loan that offers a ""cosigner release"" so that, once you've made a certain number of payments on-time [36 or 48, typically], your co-signer will be let ""off the hook."")\n\nEvery company will have slightly different credit criteria, so you might get approved for a loan at one company but denied with another. If you're interested in learning more about the various lenders' credit criteria, start with the list of private loan lenders on FinAid's website: http://www.finaid.org/loans/privatestudentloans.phtml ... You can go to each lender's site and read the terms and credit criteria of their loans until you find one that's right for you.\n\nFinally, don't forget that there are financing options that have nothing to do with borrowing. Apply for as many scholarships as you can.  For scholarship listings, you should try \n* looking online \n* your college's Financial Aid Office\n* your local library\n* your former high school's guidance office\n* asking ay any associations, clubs, or churches in your area\n\nIf these options still do not cover your educational costs, see if your school offers a payment plan, either of their own design or as part of an arrangement with a company like Afford or Tuition Pay (http://www.afford.com or http://www.tuitionpay.com ). These will usually entail making your year's worth of tuition payments in 10-12 montly installments instead of 1 or 2 and they usually charge minimal service fees."	Education & Reference

what is very inportan about Andorra? .  . Tourism, the mainstay of Andorra's tiny, well-to-do economy, accounts for roughly 80% of GDP. An estimated 9 million tourists visit annually, attracted by Andorra's duty-free status and by its summer and winter resorts. Andorra's comparative advantage has recently eroded as the economies of adjoining France and Spain have been opened up, providing broader availability of goods and lower tariffs.\n\nThe banking sector, with its tax haven status, also contributes substantially to the economy. Agricultural production is limited â only 2% of the land is arable â and most food has to be imported. The principal livestock activity is domestic sheep raising. Manufacturing output consists mainly of cigarettes, cigars, and furniture.\n\nAndorra is not a full member of the European Union, but enjoys a special relationship with it, such as being treated as an EU member for trade in manufactured goods (no tariffs) and as a non-EU member for agricultural products. Andorra lacks a currency of its own and uses that of its two surrounding nations. Prior to 1999 these were the French franc and the Spanish peseta, which have since been replaced by a single currency, the euro. Unlike other small European states that use the euro, Andorra does not yet mint its own euro coins; in October 2004, negotiations between Andorra and the EU began on an agreement which would allow Andorra to mint its own coins.

What is thr cellular and molceular basis of muscle contraction? .  . 1. At the neuromuscular juncture, ACh released by the synaptic terminal binds to receptors on the sarcolemma.\n\n2. The resulting change in the transmembrane potential of the muscle fiber leads to the production of action petential that spreads across the entire surface of the muscle fiber and along the T tubules.\n\n3.The sarcoplasmic reticulum releases stored calcium ions, increasing the calcium concentration of the sarcoplasm in and around the sarcomeres.\n\n4. Calcium ions bind to triponin, producing a change in the orientation of the troponin-tropomyosin complex that exposes active sites on the thin filaments (actin). Cross-bridges form when myosin heads bind to the active sites on F actin.\n\n5. The contraction begins as repeated cycles of cross-bridge binding, pivoting, and detatchment occur, powered by the hydrolysis of ATP.

Why do religious people think it's ok to tell someone they are going to hell?? . Some of you have asked why some people don't like religious people.  This is the reason folks!   There are many of you that think nothing of telling someone that they are going to hell for this reason or that reason.\nDon't cha think that this might piss people off??\n\nI consider it hate speech. . Well I prefer not to correct the asker, but technically it's fear speech, which is then interpreted as, among other things, hate speech. I prefer not to be around people that believe in hell myself, especially if they're trying to convert me, but mostly I prefer to be ignorant of their existence because I still want to be able to blend in with the crowd.\nTo answer your question, fear is the defining motive behind their belief system, and in counter to this, their belief that Jesus will save them from hell is thus made such a powerful dream. It is therefore beleived that if they can help another person to see this hell that non-believers are destined to end up provided they are made aware of the option of following Jesus. It follows as logical that once a person is afraid enough of Hell, they look to The Saviour for garanteed entry into heaven, eliminating the fear they've chosen to believe in.\nGiven that this is true, it is considered a moral duty to help non-believers see hell as real, and help them to avoid ending up there. It is also considered moral to inform people who have never heard of Jesus that a saviour exists to free them from their suffering (which you'll agree there's a lot of in this world), and this is the driving force behind the rapidly spreading global Catholic movement. These 2 facets are the 2 kinds of people you meet on the street, ramming scripture down your throat with a smile and kind words. They're doing it out of love, compassion and a heartfelt belief in the impossible. It's not hate speech, its dillusional psychosis. Have a nice day. :)	Society & Culture

Apartments: 1st floor or third floor? Which is better? Economically/noise/bugs, etc.? . I am moving again, and usually choose a first floor apt. I wonder if a third floor apt. is more beneficial- heat/cooling, less spiders, etc.  I believe it to be safer... . I'm an apartment locator and here's what I've come across in my many years in the business.   \n\n2nd floor is best for cheaper utilities b/c your sandwiched b/w the other two apartments, remember heat rises.   \n\nA third floor is more beneficial when it comes to noise, safety and of course bugs as you mention.

Can anyone describe for me what Engineering Consultancy entails? .  . As a consultant in an engineering consultancy firm you will be called to solve problems in other companies. Assume that you work for such a firm. Typically you will bring in some expertise that will be in the general area that this consultancy specializes in. You will fill a gap. Consultacies typically hire for the sort of expertise sought for by the companies seeking their consultancy (called clients). As a consultant, frequently your job will be to understand the client's problems, analyze them, suggest solutions and prepare an in-depth report. The client may even give your company the task of implementing the solution. There is a wide breadth in the capabilities of consultancy firms - some are considered real experts in their areas; some are simply filling temporary employment. It can be pretty challenging and fun in a constantly changing setting. Consultants often travel a lot to go and work at their client's site. You will also be assigned to some other client when the assignment is over with one. That may even involve a move to another city. Such travel and moves may not be to your liking. One thing is for sure - you will learn a lot working with a variety of clients. That kind of experience is very valuable. Good luck.	Business & Finance
"What is group therapy like?  I would appreciate anyone sharing their experiences with me.? . My therapist wants me to go to group therapy to help me cope with my grief over the death of my brother.  I don't want to go. What's it like?  Does everyone just sit around and cry and whine about themselves?  I don't want to talk about it with a bunch of strangers. Did it help you?  Thanks . Having been both a leader as well as a participant of ""group therapy"", I could offer many perspectives.  Personally, my experiences with groups have mostly been good.  Each group is different in its focus, purpose and participants, so you may have a variety of experiences depending on these variables.\n\nIf your therapist has recommended that you go to a group on grief, you might find it quite helpful to your process of loss.  Many times group members benefit from participation because they are in a ""group"" of people who understand and can identify with their shared issue (in your case, grief).  Because people deal with grief differently, you may benefit from learning new ways of coping yourself.  You may also find some very supportive individuals who can connect with your personal pain.  The most important thing about attending a group is how the group leader leads the group.  It's important that a leader not allow one person to monopolize the group's time.  It's also important that the group has well defined boundaries so that members are not allowed to mistreat or verbally abuse each other.\n\nI suggest that you attend the group at least 2-3 times. If you find that you enjoy the leader and feel that they are skilled at leading the group, then you may have found a great place.  If you also find that there are members who you enjoy and who also make you feel supported and SAFE in your process of grief, then you should really consider participating.  Groups typically do NOT sit around and just cry all the time.  Groups are created to bring people of similar experience together for the sake of growth, development, support and understanding. I suggest you give it a chance and see what happens.  No one will force you to talk and share your dark secrets.  No one will force you to cry about your loss, and no one will force you to comfort another group member.  Don't be afraid of the unknown.  You just might find that you meet someone, or make a friend that really helps you in your life (currently or in the future).  Be open to the possibility, and I'm deeply sorry for your great loss."

in the January sales ,who do you think the Ger's should go for ?? . should the bears plunder the wee diddy teams for players or go for more european players \nwe have got to do something about that defence !!!\ngers fans only !!!\nothers feel free to have a dig !!!! . I think we definitely need to invest in a pair of central defenders after seeing those two avoidable goals we conceded against Auxerre last week.  I think we should try and get Pressley because he is a good leader and organiser at the back.  The problem with our defence at the moment is that we don't have a good leader in that department.  We need a solid Scottish spine in the Rangers team again like we had during the 9-in-a-row years with Richard Gough.  I think we have an excellent leftback in Stevie Smith.\n\nI think we need to bolster the midfield to create competition for places and I think Scott Brown and Stephen Thompson would be excellent additions in that department.  We also need another striker to work with Kris Boyd.  Prso can't last 90 minutes these days, and the word is this is going to be his last season in any case.\n\nI think Filip Sebo is a waste of space.  He hasn't shown any inclination of being of any use whatsoever.  He has no pace, no skill, no vision and he couldn't score in a whorehouse.  We should offload him as soon as possible.  We need a striker who can hold the ball up as well as Michael Mols did, or Mark Hateley because as good as Kris Boyd is as a finisher, he is not all that great at holding the ball up and playing in other people.

How did Europe come to be dominated by the two superpowers after 1945? .  . Europe was broke from two World Wars.  They were already in poor economic shape before the war.  France was once again devastated by fighting on its territories.  Germany, the greatest European power, was divided into two zones, one controlled by the Soviet Union, and the other by France, UK, and the US, though the US had all the power.  Though the USSR was also devastated by the war, the battle of Stalingrad being the most deadly of the war, they quickly rebounded by treating Eastern Europe as an essential colony and stripping war material from East Germany.  The United States had been on the assent for some time, and would have become a superpower regardless of the war, but it just made them that much more powerful that potential German or British challengers.  During the war, at the meeting of Yalta between Roosevelt and Stalin, it was agreed that the USSR would get de factor control over Eastern Europe to administer it as it saw fit.  Later agreements led to the division of conquered Japanese territory, such as Korea.  This division was intended to only be temporary. But because of the ideological differences between the two, it quickly became clear that the U.S. and the USSR would become competitors.  While this led to proxy war in Korea, in Europe it devolved into a stalemate.  KGB battled the CIA, with both rigging elections through the continent.  Berlin was blockade from receiving food, with the West airdropping food in response.  Eventually it became the situation of the iron curtain, with a divided Europe, each side reliant on a superpower to prevent from becoming a battleground between the two. Though some countries showed some independence, mainly France and Yugoslavia, they were largely required to toe the line or fear losing protection.	Politics & Government

If you don't declare the money, you will get caught and get charged with a serious crime when you cross the border.  The best way to handle this is to call a bank in New York from mexico and open an account.  You do not have to be a citizen.  However, banks in the US are strictly controlled by the government and your info WILL be reported to our IRS.  You may have to pay taxes of some sort (although I can't imagine what on).  It is simple to hire someone to do your taxes here.  And you will have to file taxes and pay whatever the law says you must every year.  This is also very strict here.  Not doing so, will get you in trouble with the law.  It's easies just to hire someone to do this for you and doesn't cost much.\n\nAnyway.  Go to your bank in mexico and send your money to your bank in the US using a wire transfer.	Business & Finance

"Does think todays war is just a personal vendetta? . Our current president was business partners with Osamas brother Salem, whom died in a freak plane crash in Texas. Doesn't that seem odd? . According to a 1976 trust agreement, Salem bin Laden appointed James Bath as his business representative in Houston. Revelation about Bathâs relationship with the bin Laden financial empire and the CIA was made public in 1992 by Bill White, a former real estate business partner with Bath. White informed federal investigators in 1992 that Bath told him that he had assisted the CIA in a liaison role since 1976 â the same year former President George Herbert Walker Bush served as director of the CIA.Like his father in 1968, Salem died in a 1988 air crash...in Texas. He was flying a BAC 1-11 which had been bought in July 1977 by Prince Mohammed Ben Fahd. The plane's flight plans had long been at the center of a number of investigations. According to one of the plane's American pilots, it had been used in October 1980 during secret Paris meetings between US and Iranian emissaries. Nothing was ever proven, but Salem bin Laden's accidental death revived some speculation that he might have been ""eliminated"" as an embarrassing witness. In fact, an inquiry was held to determine the exact circumstances of the accident. The conclusions were never divulged.But the US government knows, and is deeply alarmed by the danger that the dollar may be losing its status as the worldâs only reserve currency. Given the huge deficits that plague the US economy, the US dollarâs value would collapse if other countries began to see it as just another currency, so the euro must be prevented from emerging as an alternative reserve currency. In practice, that means the Iranian experiment with a euro-denominated oil bourse must be stopped â and the only way to do that is to attack Iran.\n\nSome of the scenario-mongers would change the sequence of events and have the US launch a âpreventiveâ attack against Iran before it even opens the bourse. An alternative scenario has Washington persuading Israel to do the dirty work of actually launching air strikes against Iran. But a lot of people are genuinely worried that the whole crisis over Iranâs alleged nuclear weapons program is being whipped up to give Washington cover for a strike against Iran that is really meant to halt the bourse."

To write a program to show  a cube  from any angle. What is best math approach to use.? . Using 3-D coordinate geometry takes a long time. Is there an easier way. . Some additional material to add to the excellent answer #1. In case you're not familiar with transformation matrices, this is an answer I gave to a question on rotations in graphics.\nYou can describe rotations and the effect they have on each point in the figure mathematically by means of simple trigonometric equations which can be condensed into a matrix. Imagine (or better, draw) a point on the plane in coordinate system X0,Y0, located at X0=1, Y0=0. Draw a line to the point from the origin. Now draw another coordinate system X1,Y1 with the same origin as X0,Y0 but rotated CW by an angle Theta. (Make Theta small, say 30 degrees.) What are the coordinates of our point in the new system? The answer is a function of Theta. We find that the point is above the X1 axis and nearer the Y1 axis. Specifically, X1 = X0*cosine(Theta) and Y1 = X0*sine(Theta). \nNow if you repeat this with a new point at X0=0, Y0=1, you find that X1 = -Y0*sine(Theta) and Y1 = Y0*cosine(Theta).\nNow the good part. You can put these four equations together to find X1,Y1 for any value of X0,Y0 (not just points located on one axis or the other). The result is\nX1=X0*cosine(Theta) - Y0*sine(Theta)\nY1=X0*sine(Theta) + Y0*cosine(Theta)\nNext you form a rotation matrix R from the Theta-dependent parts of these equations:\nR=[cosine(Theta)___ -sine(Theta)]\n__[sine(Theta) ___ cosine(Theta)] \nNow when you multiply any vector P0, representing any point in X0,Y0 coordinates, by this matrix R using the rules of matrix multiplication, you are actually using the above two equations, and the result is a vector P1 which is the same point represented in X1,Y1 coordinates. Expressed compactly, P1 = R*P0. P0 is said to be transformed by R to P1.\nOf course, this is a 2-dimensional transformation, and R is a 2x2 matrix. And rotation is about only one basis axis. To expand to a 3x3 matrix that accommodates rotation about any arbitrary axis is not difficult. The ref. is a good starting point.	Science & Mathematics

Is a subspace of a supercompact space also supercompact? .  . NO.\n\nSupercompact means that there is a subbase for the topology such that any cover by subbasic elements has a subcover with exactly two elements. Any supercompact space is compact by the Alexander sub-base theorem (which is sometimes used to prove Tychonoff's theorem).\n\nThe closed unit interval is supercompact, but the open unit interval is not.  It's not clear to me immediately whether closed subspaces of supercompact spaces need be supercompact.\n\nAdded:\n\nIt turns out that the Stone-Cech compactification of the naturals is not supercompact. Since it can be embedded as a closed subspace of a product of intervals and since products of supercompact spaces are supercompact, this gives an example of a closed subspace of a supercomapct space whichis not supercompact.

"Feminine diapers for convenience? . I recently heard from a girlfriend that does market research that after a survey in 2005 of women ages 19-44 they found that about 6% are using an adult diaper for *convenience* during long trips, at shows/sports watching to avoid long women's bathroom lines, flights, etc. This company is now referring to them as ""feminine diapers"" (like feminine napkins). These are healthy women with no incontinence problems - just convenience. Can you let me know if you have ever done this? Do they work well? I have thought about it - but not seriously until now.\nPlease respond especially if you have done this. Do they work well, feel dry, etc? I'm considering it. Also, since most of you will be ""ewww"" and so on, please leave that off, since I'd like to hear *why* they are used for convenience. . The only time i might slightly consider this is when i am in the ninth month of a pregnancy, you know when you are so big that if you sneeze a little pee slips out but usually i just wear a regular pantyliner for that occassion. I wouldn't do this unless you have a problem making it on time to the bathroom. They should do something about those long lines and provide use with more stalls."	Society & Culture

How does an RPG/Bazooka destroy a tank? . I know that the rocket uses a shaped charge explosive to penetrate armor.  But a shaped charge just makes a hole and sends a little piece of metal flying really fast through the hole.  So what?  What's so anti-tank about that?  It's just a hole.  It seems to me that at most, if you're lucky, it'll kill one member of the crew inside. . Steve and JRS have very good answers. When the rocket's shaped charge penetrates the armor, it sends all sorts of flame, toxic fumes, shock wave, shattered and liquified bits of metal from the weapon and the armor, and other nasty things, inside the enclosed cabin of the vehicle. This does extensive damage to the crew and to the vehicle.\n\nOne of the things that has made the Abrams superior on the battlefield is the fact that the various elements of the vehicle (crew, engine, ammunition, fuel) are compartmentalized in heat- and blast-proof sections, so when the engine gets hit it doesn't kill the crew, when the fuel gets hit, the explosion goes out rather than in.\n\nAnd yes, the Abrams is a Chrysler!

if diamond has a property of gettin converted to graphite then y doesnt it turn into it when we purchase it.? .  . It is energetically more stable for carbon atoms to have the configuration of graphite at atmospheric pressure.  However, under lots of pressure, it obviously favors diamond.  It doesn't change back because even though it is more favorable to be graphite, it is much harder for carbon to do the changing necessary.  It's like, dropping a ball, if you drop it inside a 20 story building, it'll still only hit the floor in front of you.  It would have less potential energy on the 1st floor, but it would have to have lots more energy than it does to get there.	Education & Reference

Make sure you do system maintenance once a week or so.  Run Disc Cleanup on C drive - and make sure to run DeFrag.  Make sure to reboot after doing those two things (in that order).

Please help! Antibiotics not helping my prostatitis!!? . I took Cipro for 10 days, Septra for 10 days, now doxycycline for 10 days. Each time, things cleared up greatly for a few days, then symptoms returned. I know that sometimes you have to take anti-biotics for 4-12 weeks to get better. Does that mean that my symptoms won't improve for a few weeks and I shouldn't be concerned yet? I'm terrified that I have one of those cases of prostatitis that never goes away. I know this happens sometimes but just don't know if I'm overreacting because it's taking some time to get better. I'm miserable! Pain, no sexual function...I'm basically incapacitated. Has anyone had prostatitis that took a long time to clear up? Please help!! I'm only 32!! . One of the most effective treatment protocols for this problem is a combination of frequent vigorous prostatic massage combined with long term antibiotic therapy. The prostate has a poor blood supply and in order to ensure that a sufficient amount of antibiotics get into this gland, proper drainage is required. Regular massage combined with long term antibiotic treatment should solve this problem.\nIt is most important to ensure that your sexual partner be treated as well. If your partner is a woman, any recurrent yeast infections are a definite sign of her being infected with a non-culturable STD organism. The presence of these organisms can be proven with a PCR (DNA) test.\nIf she has this problem, an effective treatment is oral fluconazol combined with a topical antifungal like terconazol together with a prolonged treatment of a newer tetracycline analogue taken orally. Although macrolide antibiotics (long acting erythromycins) work, they can become problematic when combined with  oral antifungal medications.\nIncidentally, the reason why women develop vulval yeast infections 'down there' is because the mucous membranous lining in that area has lost its integrity from an underlying nanobacterial infection. This type of bug cannot be grown in a typical lab. Keep in mind that yeast is everywhere and opportunistic. Conditions have to be just right before it can make a home anywhere on your body.\nThe unfortunate thing is that a lot of healthcare providers aren't aware of this phenomenom so it's often treated erroneously.\nAlthough the fluoroquinolone antibiotics are very effective, minocycline has been proven to be very safe when used long term.

"What is the phone number for Laray D. Taite? .  . Hi Michael,\nI don't know if a phone number will be of any use any more.\nI met the Laray D. Taite once, a few weekends ago. I was walking to the corner market for a loaf of bread when I had to pass by a neighborhood church. I was somewhat acquainted with the structure as it was always mentioned in the newspaper's community section. Known as ""The loft,"" folks would gather there on Thursday evenings for poetry readings. \nHowever, this day happened to be a Saturday afternoon and a pair of gentlemen greeted me as I walked by. They invited me inside to sample an hour of their presentation. Ok, I went inside and found myself to be a prospective new recruit for their brand of religion. \n\nMost of the pews were filled with hooded monks chanting a haunting rhythm. There were others who like me, were wearing their regular denims. The service began like most others that church-goers would be familiar with. A grand master of ceremonies led the group through some songs and gave a sermon. Near the end of the hour it was time for their ritual of ""laying on of the hands."" Some of the parishioners would come forward and ask for prayers for their ailments or for a sick grand mum who fell down in the tub. All the hooded dudes whose faces could not readily be seen would all place a hand on the person and their combined energies were presumed to have a strength and expedite a solution to the problem. \n\nOK now, there was another new guy in the pews who was watching eagerly. I recognized Laray D. Taite from a wanted poster viewed earlier at the post office. When he saw a chance, he approached the ring of conspirators and described how he was always moving around and never able to settle down. The hooded goons closed in upon him, all to make a physical connection. The master of ceremonies began a prayer, a dogmatic mix of logic and pure hocus-pocus. I immediately saw the effects of the procedure as the tension went out of Laray D. Taite's body. When the beseeching was near an end, the master asked, ""Are the brothers ready?"" \n\nA suspenseful few moments passed until he almost shouted, ""NOW!"" \n\nOn that cue, the brothers began to pummel their hapless victim. Continually delivering blows over head and to the solar plexus until Laray D. Taite was down on the floor getting stomped. After another minute, the grand Pooh-Bah decided the treatment administered was sufficient to induce a relaxing calm that would assuage the nervousness of Laray D. Taite for a long, long time. \n\nI can't say for certain if Laray D. Taite got the comeuppance he deserved as I had a loaf of bread to buy and some other errands to do that day. I hope for you Michael, that you do find a sense of closure to this difficult episode of life. \n\n-Kobb"	Family & Relationships

"why do people hate jews? . im not one, i just feal sorry for them. . Traditionally people have hated jews for a variety of reasons:\n\n1. They were without a ""homeland"" so jewish people lived in other countries.  They were pockets of this very ethnic group (with VERY different religion, practices and appearance) in the middle of another country.  These kinds of ""very different"" people are always hated by the majority group.\n\n2.  They ""killed Christ"" so were persecuted.  (Nevermind the logic that Christ himself would have been jewish by default)\n\n3. As an ethnic group they were often better educated than the ""majority ethic group"" of the country they were living in and they did well by material posessions.  They often engaged in banking (before there were proper banks) and were the ""money lender"" for the town.  Some would say ""loan shark.""  And people who borrow money from that person , hate that person."	Society & Culture

one of my fingernails has turned black after having the door slammed on it? . people say to get the dry blood out..any painless suggestions?? and others say it will fall off..its only black at the bottom half, so how long do u think it will take before it falls off? . If the nail is still connected to the finger do not try to remove it.\n\nAll you have is the equivalent of a bruise but on your nail.  Most of the blood will be absorbed back into your finger and any that is left will grow out with the nail - it won't look very pretty but should be painless.\n\nIf the nail is hanging off go and see a medical professional - They will make a call as to whether it is best to remove, some or all of, the nail and will do it such a way so as to not to cause infection.  \n\nIf you try to do this yourself you could also end up changing the growth pattern of the nail and end up with an ingrown finger nail.

"Have you ever felt that the events around you are repeating themselves? Is it Extra Sensory Perception? . Sometimes I feel as if I am undergoing (experiencing) EXACTLY the same set of events which have already occured. For example: I feel that all the persons who are sitiing around me have sat in exactly the same manner. We are discussing exactly the same things. In fact, I can actually tell the next sentence which is about to be spoken and who is the person who will speak it. I can also tell who will enter the room...\nIs it because I have seen exactly the same things in past in dream and it is turning out to be true act by act? Is it what they call as hunches or intuitions or 6th sense? In India we believe that those whose legs come out first at the time of birth possess these special powers. They can act as 'mediums' for supernatural experiments (occult). I was born normal with head first. Then why am I having these powers? Have you experienced it yourself? Can we actually see the future? Is time travel a possibility? . Sounds like DÃ©ja Vu.\n\nIt has been speculated by some that this results from one side of the brain processing information a split second after the other. Thus, one part of your brain experiences an event, and it is recorded there. Then immediately the other side ""experiences"" the same thing, and it recognizes it as something that has already happened, because it ""remembers"" what the other side experienced just previous to this."

"What does Cannon mean in a religious context? . As in, ""The scripture was cannonized.""  Also there are positions in the Catholic church called Cannon.  And I believe Cannon is a section of the church as well.  Where did this word come from and what does it mean in a religious context? . 'Canon,' in this context, comes from a word meaning 'measuring rod.' It refers to the books which are recognized as being the Word of God.\n\nFor Old Testament books, they were not accepted unless people knew that they were written by a prophet.  Most books of the Old Testament have a connection to the book before them; this is known as the colophon principle.  Many of the apocryphal books in Catholic bibles were never accepted by the Jews of the time, but were added centuries later.\n\nFor New Testament books, they were not accepted unless they were written by an apostle or by a close traveling companion of an apostle (ie, Mark and Luke).\n\nAs far as the Catholic church goes, they have their 'canon law,' which they define as ""the name attached to that body of rules or laws for the direction of all faithful in matters of faith and conduct.""  It is their laws which they have added to the Bible.\n\nAs far as a 'section of the church,' I assume you mean a church building; in classical architecture, the chancel is the area where the people sit."

Is there a problem if every other breath is a really deep one? . Constantly take deep breaths in (like they want you to do at the doctor). Seems like every few breaths, in just everyday activities. Is there a reason for this? Any harm in this? I really feel like I can't help it. . That always happens to me, but it has to do with my asthma.  Asthmatics sometimes don't get enough oxygen as a normal person would with ordinary breaths, and thus have to take deeper breaths (probably without realizing it) to get the job done.  I often find myself doing that... and yawning can have to do with that as well.  Sometimes when exerting a lot of energy, my asthma kicks in just a little bit, and I start yawning.\nAnxiety could also cause this.\n\nAlso it could just be that your other breaths, that aren't so deep, aren't bringing in enough oxygen-- so you have to rectify that by breathing more heavily every so often.\n\nIf you find it happening in certain locations, such as only at work-- it could be that the ventilation isn't that great, and fresh air isn't coming in as much as it should.\n\nAlso, being around a lot of smoke certainly won't make your lungs work any better.\n\nAll in all, there are a lot of explanations... I would just mention it to your doctor next time you go.  If it gets any worse, you should make an appt to see him.	Health

"How do you ""get a life""? . People say this all the time but really how do you get a life? . In my own personal opinion, a life is anything that you do that is not controlled by someone else and is not morfed just so it fits into the ""in"" style; it is your own personal thing.\n\nMeaning, if someone reads, and that is ALL they do, but they do it because it is a passion, that is a life. On the other hand, if someone plays sports and works out all the time just to look cool, they have no life.\n\n\nGetting a life is not a matter of changing yourself to seem more likeable in the face of the media and public, a life is a personality that is unique."

Call and apologise to her. It sounds like she was lonely but not emotionally ready to mess around. Sorry, but as her friend you should have slowed down. I know she didn't stop you at the time, but she needs you to apologise and act the part of the sensitive male. \nSay that you're sorry that you crossed a line and you didn't mean to take advantage of her in any way.

Why can't two women or two men have a child together? . I'm NOT asking your opinion as to whether it would be right or wrong.  This question has nothing to do with any associated ethical or moral issues.  This is a pure science question.\n\nIf scientists and doctors can do in vitro fertilization with an egg and a sperm, why can't they do it with two sperm or two eggs?  Why can't they take the nucleus out of the egg of one woman, and then put it directly into another egg from another woman?  Wouldn't it have the same effect as injecting a sperm into an egg?  What about removing the nucleus from a donor egg, then replacing it with the nucleus of a sperm from one man, and then fertilizing the resulting egg with the sperm of another man?\n\nWould this work?  What factors would make this impossible?  Is it possible and it just hasen't been done yet?  Has it been done yet, and I just haven't heard about it?\n\nI want educated answers please.  Thank you. . I dont know much cuz im just in high school and not pro but heres my understanding:\nLets begin with the possibilities. Two sperm cells cleary would not work cuz of the YY issue and that wouldn't techniquelly be human anymore. However, in the female XX would be human. problem is The egg cell has a jelly coat whihc protects it. The one sperm cell that fertilizes uses enzymes to digest it away and the sperm cell must bind to a receptor site. Since we know very little about the protein world and how these receptors exactly work, just like we dont know how EXactly carrier proteins work in plasma membranes, its difficult to figure how to do it. Since implanting and fusing the two nuclei of the eggs would not initiate these receptor cyets, the zygote may not necessarly divide. It would just be a mutated egg like before and a sitting duck. You wouldn't get mitosis since it still techniquelly thinks its a gamete and wouldn't replicate. Also, too my understanding, the egg and sperm nuclei are drastically different in size and also chemical makeup may vary.Thats my assesment of the situation. Again, I'm not an expert but i think that might be enough to answer the question.	Science & Mathematics

"Concern(s) for the Future Family... Please Help :)? . My Husband and I are looking forward to having kids and it'll be so wonderful, and so much fun too! :)\n\nAsside from all other concerns on how to raise them, etc., my main concern might sound silly at some point. Both of us are wearing glasses because of the vision problems: I have 6.5/7.0 vision and he has about 29.0 vision in both eyes (that's worse than my vision), due to that he has to wear specially designed glasses for his eye-sight just to see well. Only few of my relatives actually wear glasses, but due to the other health problems. And, as far as I know, no one wears them on his side of the family.\n\nMy questions are: How will this fact affect our kids? Will they have to wear glasses too? And/or how seriously their vision ""problem"" will be? Does the vision problem skip a generation, or not?\n\nIn other words: What should we know ahead of time so that way we'll know how to help, assist, and guide our kids in case they'll have to wear glasses or have any other vision problems? . Depends entirely if your sight condition is hereditary or not your ophthalmologist should be able to tell you this, next time you go in ask about you eye condition and your husbands and go ahead and ask about any other hereditary condition that you may concern yourself with. But don't let that be the deciding factor in having children there is a chance in even the worst cases that your children will never have anything you or your husband have,don't think about those things too much just enjoy each other and the idea of your family!"

Then again, people are paid the minimum wage here, there is no expectation in say the restaurant industry that the person will pad their wages out with the tips that they make - they get paid the minimum wages no matter what, and tips are a nice bonus!

Or, can you tell me how to find or contact any youth programs or the likes that can help me? . Try your High school, or one around your area. Most businesses who are looking for teens give the applications to High schools hoping to recruit students that way. You could always try working at the mall or an amusement park, or maybe even a restaurant, those places are usually pretty flexible. However to be completely honest with you it is highly unlikely a business will hire you. Most places won't do it for insurance purposes. Enjoy the summer while you still can.

what are some other good tummy trimming excercises besides situps/crunches? . situps dont seem to help my obliques and lower abs!! i do atleast 120 situps a day but ususally more like 150-200 . There's no exercises which would allow you to lose fat in any specific area (like your abdominal area). When you burn fat, the fat loss is spread throughout your body. Doing tons of crunches would only help to strengthen your abdominal muscles, but what you want to do is reduce the layer of fat that covers your abs (crunches/situps are a VERY ineffective way of reducing fat).\n\nTo get a flatter stomach, the most important things are to watch what you eat (total # of calories as well as the amount of fat) and doing cardio, such as running or swimming. Cut out junk food such as soda, chips, fast food, etc.. and set a regular schedule for yourself to go for a run maybe 2-3 times a week (more if you'd like) and you'll be on your way to a thinner waistline.

Jot down things that are on your mind before you study, then set this list to the side. Add to it anything that distracts you as you are studying. Take care of the list later.\n\n2. Study at the same time each day. A regular schedule can help you frame this as âstudy timeâ.\n\n3. Set a timer for an hour, don't allow yourself to stop studying until it goes off.\n\n4. Take breaks. A three minute break for every 30 minutes of study is a good guideline. Take a longer break after 90 minutes.\n\n5. Set goals for your session that are realistic (number of problems to solve, pages to read, etc.) When you have met one of your study goals, reward yourself with a short break. Then, return to your study area.\n\n6. Study in an area away from distractions such as a library, study lounge, or an empty classroom.\n\n7. Make sure you have everything that you need before you begin.\n\n8. Make sure your environment is conducive to studying, no TV, no telephone, no roommate, no boyfriend/girlfriend.\n\n9. Make studying an active process; take notes and make review sheets. Intersperse different kinds of study into one session, e.g. reading, writing, taking notes, memorizing, etc.\n\n10. Identify how what you are studying is relevant to your life. Draw connections between things you already know.\n\n11. Insure that you are sleeping enough, eating well, and getting regular exercise. Your mind will be more alert, and you will be less likely to fall asleep or daydream.\n\nGOOD LUCK !!!	Education & Reference

Why do our voices change when we inhale Helium? .  . It does NOT constrict the vocal chords. Helium is an INERT gas. Inert neaning that it doesn't react with anything, inmcluding the vocal chords. If there is no chemcial interactiom occuring whatsover then how can it possibly cause restriction?\n\n\nHelium changes the pitch of your voice simply because it is much less dense than air, and thus sound travels faster through helium. The faster sound travels the higher the higher the pitch.	Science & Mathematics

Tryin to lose weight!? . I been struggling to lose weight for some time now and I'm having some problems. I wanted to know is it okay for me to eat sharp cheddar chesse. Also what is a good way to lose weight without cutting carbs. . cutting carbs wont make you lose weight. you simply have to consume less calories than you burn during the day. \nso techincally, you coudl eat candy for every meal, as long as you exercise enough you will still lose weight, though i would HIGHLY not reccomend that one. your calories shoudl come from the following:\n55-65% carbs\n20-25% fats\n10-25% protein\n\nthe best place to start is by reducing fat, since they contain the most calories. \nand you can eat sharp cheddar. just keep in mind that it wont jsut magically happen, you will have to work for it but anything is possible. i've seen some incredible transformations.\n\nAnd do not try to use supplements to help you lose weight. they are some of the biggest scams ever.

Mob mentality has a lot to do with their behavior.  People will do things in a group they would never do if alone.\n\nThe immigration issue is a difficult one.  What needs to happen is that workable, enforceable laws must be established and supported that allow LEGAL access for those wanting to work in our country, but they must work within the system.  If they don't, and we allow that, it's an insult to every immigrant who waited and worked to get here legally.\n\nWe simply cannot allow our laws to not only be disrespected and disregarded, but to have to financially support those who are breaking our laws as well.  That recipe will lead to disaster for our state and our country.  So change the laws.  Establish a win win situation for both sides.\n\nOur neighbors across the street worked three jobs each to get enough money to legally bring their relatives to the United States.

When can 2 persons in a relation know n realise dat its all over? .  . These two persons have two traits:  they are individuals but they are also a couple.  Thus they have two views, one as individuals other as a couple.  When they still have a view as a couple (no matter how small or dirty or awful this view is) they can say it is not over yet, if they only remain the view as individuals... then the relationship is over...\n\nNow, you mention 'know' and 'realise' this is the main problem because generally neither as individuals nor as a couple it is easy to realise if it is over.  \n\nYou have to play out your individual part which mean separate for a while... then think and meditate... so that you can find that 'SOMETHING' that keeps you together... if you meditate but just don't find that something then you'll 'realise' and then 'know' that it is all over.

Why does PREVIOUSLY UNHEARD music sometimes invoke an emotional response such as crying? . If the song is new to the person hearing it, it must not be reminding him/her of someone or something.  What is it about a song, other than an attached memory, that can make someone cry? . Something about the sound. I think noises sometime mess with our emotions more than words can. The only time I ever cried over something like a book or a movie or a song was one time when I was at the opera and I heard Lenski's Aria (it's a song from one of Tchaikovski's operas) for the first time. And the song is in Russian and I wasn't reading the subtitles so it was certainly just the sound and not the words that made me cry. Well, the acting might have had a lot to do with it. The tenor was a really good emotive actor and really conveyed the characters' emothions to the audience.	Entertainment & Music

Why does it seem that soccer is more popular with females than males? .  . Because men like to watch sports where the guys have time to stand around and scratch.

I love the constant motion with very few breaks in the aciton.  Here is a rundown on most sports as I see them:\n\nbaseball - NO action unless player hits ball\nfootball - most of the time moves only 10 yards every hour\nbasketball - too many time outs and what fun is it to watch a game where the guys are all so tall that there is NO challenge getting the ball in the hoop...they just walk up and drop it in\ngolf - boring!  takes 10 minutes to decide to hit the ball, hit the ball, then walk for another 10 minutes, repeat	Sports

Religious intolerance? . Why some believers of different religions, in different parts of the world, simply do not see out of the frame of their religion and judge others according to their beliefs? An example is that Catholich (mine) Church does not agree with homosexualtiy, therefore some of my friends have negative opinion about gays and lesbians, because our Book does not approve it. There's many more examples, but I will not list them here (I have already been standing in front of the wall here). Again, it is not meant against any religion, any faith, any believer! I am simply asking why should I strictly follow my Book and therefore dislike gays and lesbians, because my faith does not allow me to be one of them. I simply leave them alone and respect their different way of living, different look, different faith, whatever. Why some people set their minds in their religious framework and see no meter further? . I agree with most of the above. The things you say hold true for most believers ( in any religion). Their religion seems to make them intolerant. You are able to discern between what is reality and what is said in a very old book. Times change but the religions do not change with them, thus making a lot of religious people stay behind in the doctrines of their religion which were made thousands of years ago.	Society & Culture

"why are letters ""k"" and ""g"" in the word ""knight"" are silent? (in English language of course) .  . As others have noted, the letters WERE pronounced when the spellings originated.  And had the printing press come a century later, such things might be spelled the way we now pronounce them.\n\nThere is, however, some value in all this.  It is possible to see how words are related (to see something of their history) both within English and between English and the languages it grew out of.  Thus the spelling of word may show us connections with Germanic, French and Latin words\n\nI remember that it made it a lot easier to learn German, since I could recognize some of these words as related.  (Modern German, which DOES pronounce such sounds, has ""Knecht"" for ""knight"", ""Nacht"" for ""night"", etc.) I think it also helped with things like SATs.  Similarly, when I had to pick up a reading knowledge of French, I recognized a lot of related words (though I can't pronounce French worth a lick!)  I would think this is some help to Europeans learning English as well.\n\n------------\n\nSome more thoughts on the unstated (implied?) question -- why don't we fix it?!\n\nIncidentally, one of the things that has KEPT English from thorough spelling reforms is the fact that its vocabulary has been so freely borrowed from so many sources for centuries that there would be A LOT to try change and relearn.  (German and many other European languages did see such reforms in the past couple of centuires, but they had a lot less changing to do!)   And with the wide variety of regional pronunciations among just NATIVE English speakers, which ones would be adopt for the ""standard""?  And if there were multiple versions what kind of mess would that make?! (The differences that now exist between British and American spelling are quite minor, hardly a barrier to reading each others' writing.)\n \nThink too what this change would do for reading anything in slightly older English!   We wouldn't be able to read documents and letters of the last several centuries without 'translating' them!"	Society & Culture
Teenagers should consume at least 1200 milligrams of calcium per day....? .

One cup of\nskim milk supplies 296 milligrams of calcium, and one slice of cheddar cheese\nsupplies 338 milligrams of calcium. Source: Nutrition in Exercise and Sport\n\n\na) Write and graph an inequality that represents the amounts of skim milk and\ncheddar cheese you need to consume to meet your daily requirement of calcium. . say, we need minimum 'x' cups of skim milk and 'y' slices of cheddar cheese. Now this x,y combination should be minimum 1200 and thus the equation would be\n\n296x+338y> or equal to 1200\n\nnow to plot the graph we assume\n\n296x+338y = 1200 equation \n\nwhich will be true with following sets of x,y\n\nx = 1, y = 904/338;\nx = 0, y = 1200/338\nx = 1200/296, y =0\n\nnow, we have three locations to plot the curve and marke the domain of the curve to represent the inequality...

I've been on a 'gap-year' since then hoping that inspiration would come to me, and i would suddenly know what to do with my life. But its not happening. Do you think the army would be a good option for me? . I am not in the army but have worked on bases overseas for many years. There are definite benefits for joining the armed forces like a steady job, no rent, ultilities, health care bills, etc. You can go overseas and have interesting life experiences. It could help you figure out what you want to do with you life and provide you future career and education options.\nHowever, I have seen many bad things about the army. It is a difficult life. Depending on the job, you could have extremely long hours. There is a lot of drinking, sleezing around and promiscous behavior in general. You may be assigned to a job that you don't want and have no choice in the matter. You could die.\n\nI would go back to college if I were you and try to find an area that interests you. Having a college degree opens up so many doors that will remain shut until you have the degree, even in the military. If you really want to go into the armed forces, I would recommend the air force over the army. The quality of life, general level of education of its members, and overall organization seems to be much higher on air force bases. I have lived on army, air force and naval installations. \n\nLet me know if I can be of further assistance.	Politics & Government

how do i remove yahoo version of Explorer 7.1  and install the Microsoft plain version ? .  . OK - please stop and listen. DO NOT UNINSTALL IE7 (unless of course it is the Yahoo version which is floating around) - you'll be taking your Windows security levels back about ten steps, even if you never use Internet Explorer to surf the web.\n\n\nLet me explain - Internet explorer is extremely integrated into Windows (was first made that way last decade as Microsoft's way of dealing with Netscape!) - which means that all the bugs/flaws inherent to IE6 are all carried right throughout your system. Think of IE7 as a MASSIVE system upgrade, not just a new browser.\n\nIt may take a little getting used to, but is well worth keeping. If you have any messenger applications, these also need to re-installed after installing IE7 - just simply to restore the way they connect to IE to function properly.\n\nIf you need any help here, don't hesitate to shoot me an email - more than happy to help out :-)	Computers & Internet

Do you think that as Americans are becoming more unhealthy, that we are also becoming less intelligent? .  . The only difference in average intelligence between regional groupings stem from some populations living in such poverty that malnourishment effects their mental development in a significant way. If your question is whether less healthy lifestyles are effecting the mental development of American youth or not I would say no, at least not yet.  \n\nOn the other hand Iâve noticed that most people with the discipline to maintain a healthy lifestyle apply that same self-discipline to better educating themselves.  This is as opposed to people who are too lazy to keep themselves healthy and often struggle in competitive environments including higher education.  I think I fall somewhere between those two groups, most people do.\n\nRegards,\nArmus	Health

What was your near death experience? . a year ago I was rebuilding a dock with a friend from church. standing in waist deep water I knew it was dangerouse to be using electrical equipment but it was the only way to drill holes into the concrete foundation. After drilling the 3rd hole I place the drill gun on the wall and reached for the metal stud to place into the foundation. I pulled the cord of the gun and it fell into the water. I tried catching it (out of reaction) and my hand submerged into the water. as I brought it out I got shocked, my hand squeezed the gun and turned it on. the drill bit starting moving closer to my chest, right where my heart is. my reaction was to use my other hand to hold the gun so that my left arm wouldnt contract into my chest. if my other hand was wet I would have been dead by the shock corssing my heart and then shredded my chest open. note: this all happend in a matter of seconds. Whats your near death experience? .

The guy from the SUV was ok, thankfully. \nWe had climb up a mountain, and in the next half our 6 more cars had crashed with each other due to black ice under the bridge.	Sports

What is wrong with my semen? . why does my semen seem to be a very heavy consistency, almost like a gel?  it seems sometimes to be very coagulated. . You case is just the opposite when the sperm are diluted by excess seminal fluid. \nFirst know the semen composition:\nsperm \nfructose \nwater \nascorbic acid (Vitamin C) \ncitric acid \nvarious and sundry enzymes \nphosphate \nbicarbonate buffers (to maintain pH) \nzinc \n\nSemen coagulates within seconds after ejaculation and then liquefies or decoagulates about 15-40 minutes later. You can just make this test alone. If your coagulated semen does not liquefy within that time, your sperm may be trapped in the cottage cheese-like jelly. That just is due to the high viscosity (liquid flow) or hyperviscosity that affects the fertility potential.\nSince the prostate gland secretes the chemical required for liquifaction, surely there could be some prostate infection, responded to a simple antibiotic therapy.\nBesides, a microscopic examination will tell urologist if your sperm are clumping together (agglutinating). On such a case a number of sperm orient themselves tail-to-tail or head-to-head instead of swimming in a straight line. This clumping is another problem for fertility. This finding may indicate a problem with sperm antibodies or the presence of a bacterial infection again. \nTherefore, in the doubt, I advice you some clinic exam.	Health

Help me with chemistry project topics? . Particularly those that have to do with polymer chemistry. . I'll go out on a limb and suppose that you need some very simple projects that can demonstrate polymer properties to the layperson.\n\nPhysics:  \n\nIf you take a rubber band, an elastomer, suspend a weight from it, and gently heat the rubber band with something like a hair drier, you can demonstrate that polymer chains prefer to adopt a random coil configuration rather than a straight, linear configuration. (I'll leave out the basic thermodynamic details so you can delve deeper into the subject.)\n\n\nChemistry:\n\nTo demonstrate the differences in size between polymers and small molecules, look up the size of a single water molecule and then get a piece of foam rubber.  The water molecule's size is on the order of Angstroms, while the foam rubber is essentially one gigantic molecule.\n\nIf you have access to sebacoyl chloride and hexamethylene diamine, you can make Nylon-6 by using equal parts of both reactants.  The polymer forms at the interface of the two liquids, and you can use tweezers to pull the polymer out of the reaction vessel.  NOTE:  Proper safety precautions MUST be followed as both chemicals are irritants. \n\nI've left out sources and a lot of other details so you can research the physics/chemistry of the examples given here.

when is a women most fertile, right before or right after her period?? help.? .  . A woman ovulates 14 DAYS BEFORE HER PERIOD STARTS. There are two phases to the menstrual cycle, the follicular phase and the luteal phase. The folicular phase occurs before ovulation, luteal phase after. The follicular phase is variable in length, but the luteal phase is almost ALWAYS 14 days. So you need to work out how long your cycle is. If it was 28 days, you would ovulate on day 14, and your most fertile time would be days 12-16. But if your cycle was 32 days, you would ovulate on day 18 and your fertile time would be days 16-20.\n\nIt's very important that in working out your expected time of ovulation you count BACKWARDS from when your period is due, rather than counting forwards. Counting forwards and saying day 14 is your most fertile day is inaccurate as I've just shown above. So work out how long your cycle is, subtract 14 from it and that's the day you'll ovulate. Your most fertile time is the four days around ovulation, ie. from 2 days before until 2 days after.	Health

If we can intubate patients pleasantly, why can't we extubate them pleasantly... while they're still deep? . As a master student in anesthesiology, I always see that on the end of anesthesia, when patients wake up, they seem uncomfortable because the tracheal tube is still in place. They are bucking, fighting, BP goes high, etc. \nTo avoid this, is there, in any books or journals, any recommendations to extubate patients deep? And what is the recommended manouvre to protect the airway while waiting for the patients to be able to protect their own airway? Jaw thrust? Tilting the table head down? Lateral position? Put LMA in change of ETT? . Extubating patients when they're awake because you know that they can breathe on their own. While they're still under anesthesia, there's still the possibility they might not get enough oxygen on their own or have difficulty breathing on their own. Once they're awake and no longer under anesthesia, their brain has better control of their breathing. People freak out about the tracheal tube because you're not used to having things shoved down your throat when you wake up. But you do need to wait for them to wake up and try to keep them calm when they wake up, reassuring them that you'll take the tube out soon.	Education & Reference

So symbolically the 12 springs represent Israel sustaining the 70 nations of the world.\n\nDuring the Feast of Tabernacles a total of 70 bulls are offered up, see Numbers 19:12-34.  These 70 bulls are thought to be an offering on behalf of the 70 nations.	Society & Culture

"Do you think this is discrimination? . This happened to me about four years ago, another question made me think about this...\n\nI was moving to a new area and wanted to advertise for a babysitter because I worked an odd shift, until 8pm at night.  The small town I was moving to was on the opposite edge of the county from the only major town of that area, so there was only one real newspaper in the county.  I called to place the ad....and said I wanted the ad to say, ""Need a babysitter in the xxxx area,"" and the newspaper person threw a fit!  She said specifying a town or area, no matter HOW I phrased it, was discrimanatory and they could not run the ad. \n\nI said come on, this isn't a big money job, who will want to drive 50 miles a day round trip for $50 a week, and you expect me to field all those calls on my cell phone???  She was quite rude about the whole thing.  I just didn't get it!!!  I didn't say they HAD to be from the area, I was saying I was in that area.  I just thought this was the silliest rule... . I don't think it was discrimnation, just stupid on the newspaper lady's part. I'm not 100% sure what her point was, but it sounds like she was just on a power-trip."	Politics & Government

Why does the combination formula work (I know what it is, I want to know why it works)? .  . This is an easy derivation. \n\nMultiplicative Principle: \nOne fundamental principle of counting is that if you have n of one type of object (N) and m of another type of object (M), then the number of ways to pair objects of type one with objects of type two with regard to order is n*m. This is argued by saying that one can first pair one of the N-type objects with all of the M type objects for m pairs, and then do the same for the remaining N type objects, giving m + m + ... + m n times, or n*m pairings. \n\nPermutations:\nSuppose you have k objects and you want to know how many ways you can order them in a line. You have k ways to choose the first object, k - 1 ways of choosing the second object, and so forth until you run out of objects. By the fundamental principles of counting, this makes the number of possible orderings k*(k - 1)*...*1 = k! which we will call P(k).\n\nCombinations:\nSuppose the number of combinations of k objects out of n objects without respect to order chosen is C(n, k). If we wanted to count order, we would multiply each combination by the number of ways it could be permuted (by the fundamental principles of counting). Let P(k) be the number of ways of ordering k objects (this is just k! = k*(k-1)*...*1 ). Thus P(k)*C(n, k) is the number of ways one could choose k people out of n people with regard to order. \nBut we can easily count this number another way. The number of possible choices for the first person is n, for the second person n-1, and so on until we reach n - k + 1. Thus, we get the equation P(k)*C(n, k) = n*(n - 1)*...*(n - k + 1) = n!/(n - k)!. Solving for C(n, k), we get C(n, k) = n!/[P(k)(n - k)!] = n!/[k!(n - k)!].	Science & Mathematics

"If I am wrong please make me right please try? . Why do people complain about black slavery. Has not all races at one time in history been a slave. Then what about unjust treatment. The same things happened to other races as what happened too black (African-Americans). I am not racisit but my brother in-law says that only his people went thruogh this. Is he right. I don't think so but he will not take my word for it. . Okay, To let it be known, all things that happened in th past is brought up for a reason, to let us know what the deal was. If u havent noticed, history repeats itself in some way. Black slavery was the harshest outta all slaverys as most people have said. Yet, also, alot of other nationalities have been enslaved as well. Its just that ours were the worst. Yer bro-n-law is wrong by the way. U mite wanna educate him, and show him what the deal is, that it wasnt just blacks, it was everyone. Also, it really doent need to be brought up, unless its n a history class. \n\nHave yall seen the Dave Chappelle show, when he did the thing on Slavery Compensation. (i thought that was pretty funny) yet, if thats the case, shouldnt everyone else that was enslaved as well get paid too?? It wouldnt be fair. Ill honestly say that none of us (blacks) deserve to get paid. Paying us in money, for sumthin that has traumatized possibly the whole world is actually priceless. There isnt enuff money in the world to say, ""oh its aight""\n\nFinal answers:\nWhy people complain?? Because it still hurts and its the most recent (sort of) Yer bro-n-law is wrong.

An ounce of high grade pot can have a street value higher than an ounce of gold. Why not legalize and tax? . It is less harmful than liquor and tobbacco. . I could not possibly agree more with you. People are so reluctant to legalize marijuana because it has such a bad reputation. Of course, it gets that reputation because it is illegal and people pass judgment on it based solely on that fact. If you stop looking at the actual legality of it and just think about it morally it is a vice no worse than many others that americans find perfectly acceptable. Anything can be abused. People abuse alcohol, cigarettes, fast food, gambling and countless things which are perfectly legal and socially acceptable, but somehow so many people think smoking weed is just wrong.\nI can hardly see how continuing to make it illegal will benefit anyone. It only allows drug dealers to set the standards of production/regulation etc. all the while evading taxes. Making it illegal probably does not really curtail the use of the drug either. Did prohibition curtail the use of alcohol? nope. did it increase crime? yes.\nLegalize it and regulate it. Everyone wins. The potheads won't have to worry about getting locked up. The government can make some more cash. And we won't continue to whaste our time prosecuting potheads and enforcing rediculous laws that combat marijuana use at the expense of taxpayer's dollars.\n\naside from these reasons, weed just isn't that bad. It is not physically addictive (as is alcohol/tobacco), it does not have the reputation of making people violent/abusive (as does alcohol), it is not as closely associated with recklessness (as is alcohol) and when was the last time you threw up or had a hangover from smoking some weed? never.\n\nLegalize it!!

This question is old. If the bill is $25 and they each paid $10 but the clerk returns $1 to each and the bellboy gets the $2 tip there is no lost dollar. It's all in the way the question is presented. \n\n$25/3 = $8.33 1/3 Or 2 people paid $8.33 and the final guy paid $8.34\n\nIn the question the cents get dropped making it seem as though they each paid an even $8 with an extra $1 back.\n\n$8 + $1 = $9. You can see the cents were dropped.\n\nThe other dollar is in the till where it belongs. The bill was $25 NOT $24\n\nEDIT: This is all a question of laziness. The clerk knew 3 guys split the bill. He should have sent up $1.67 cents each for 2 guys and $1.66 for the last. \n\n$1.67 + $1.67 + $1.66 = $5.00\n\nInstead he sent up 5 $1 bills. The guys were too lazy to work out who got what out of the final $2 after taking back a $1 bill each so they let the bellboy keep the $2. \n\n0.67 + 0.67 + 0.66 = $2.00 \n\nA cheap tip for the bellboy when you look at what each one tipped.\n\nTo sum this up\n\nGuy 1 paid\n\n$8.33 (room) + 0.67 (tip) + $1 (returned) = $10.00 \n\nGuy 2 paid\n\n$8.33 (room) + 0.67 (tip) + $1 (returned) = $10.00 \n\nGuy 3 paid\n\n$8.34 (room) + 0.66 (tip) + $1 (returned) = $10.00	Science & Mathematics

What is the coolest, most high tech fighter jet out today? .  . F-35 Lightning II.  The F-35s will be the first successful Joint Strike Fighter in the United States military.  The F-22 Raptor was suppose to be the first, but because of difficulties that arose while trying to convert some of the aircraft's systems to be used with the Navy the F-22 was left for the Air Force.  The F-35 has solved those problems and will now be able to be used by the Air Force, Navy, and Marines.  The improved stealth technology that is used with the F-35 makes it virtually invisible even while firing munitions.  The new design allows for the F-35 to open the munitions bay doors, lock on a target, fire the munitions, and close the doors again, all in a matter of seconds.  The F-35 has vertical thrusters, and an arresting hook making it possible to land on aircraft carriers.  The improved thrust vectoring makes the F-35 literally turn on a dime.  This fighter will also use Super Cruise, giving it the ability to exceed Mach 1 without using afterburners, thus saving on the fuel the aircraft uses.  It will be capable of using a very wide variety of air-to-air and air-to-ground weapons, making this the most capable fighter in the United States military arsenal.	Politics & Government

what is homeschool? .  . Home school is were parents choose to teach their children at home versus putting them in private or public.\n\nMost times it may be due to the child not doing well at school, or the parents wanting to protect the children from the outside influences of society. Some parents think that they can do a better job, and in some cases I would agree. I myself, think that it is more important for children to attend school so that they have the interaction of other peers their age. But most defiantly it is a personal choice and anyone can choose that option.\n\nIt can be a very good thing when the parents are disciplined and follow through with proper teaching, a few years ago a girl who was home schooled won the national spelling bee. There are some cases though were the children are in fact on a year round vacation, and not taught or not at the level that they should be. It is a tough call and one that I do feel should be better managed and monitored.	Education & Reference

Static: What does static mean in java? . Please help. Kinda give an example. . static has two meanings.\n\n\nwhen applied to a method in a class, ... it means that the method will be available without having to instantiate a class.\n\nSay you have a class called: Foo. and a method called Bar(), if the method was static I would use the method like this:\n\nFoo.Bar();\n\nif the method isn't static, you use it like this...\n\nFoo f = new Foo();\nf.Bar();\n\ndo you see the difference? the same exact method is available to many instantiations of a class, while each instantiation has it's own method otherwise... \n\n\nAnother meaning of static is taken from C,C++ and can be applied to a variable.\n\nLets say you have a static variable, it's kinda like a global variable. It will keep it's value from the last run of the function... an example might make this all clear.\n\npublic class Test\n{\n\npublic static void Foo()\n{\nstatic int i = 0;\ni++;\nSystem.out.println(i);\n}\n\npublic void Foo2()\n{\nstatic int i = 0;\ni++;\nSystem.out.println(i);\n}\n\npublic void Foo3()\n{\nint i = 0;\ni++;\nSystem.out.println(i);\n}\npublic static void main(String args[])\n{\n     Test a = new Test();\n     Test b = new Test();\n\n     a.Foo2();\n     b.Foo2();\n     a.Foo2();     \n     b.Foo3();\n     b.Foo3();\n     b.Foo3();\n     Test.Foo();\n     Test.Foo();\n     Test.Foo();\n     \n}\n\n}\n\n\nif you run that program the output should be:\n\n1\n1\n2\n1\n1\n1\n1\n2\n3	Computers & Internet

Coldfusion is macromedia's answer to ASP and PHP. it uses a language similar to PHP and IMO is inferior to ASP.NET. Maybe that's because I use ASP.NET everyday.\n\nFireworks is a Photoshop + Imageready and is very good to get started in graphic design, however; it will never be a replacement for good old photoshop.\n\nFlash is used to create animations, either swf files or animated gifs.\n\nFreehand is a vector graphic program akin to Illustrator.

"what team will be the surprising team? .  . It is hard to distinguish surprising. Last time Turkey and Korea in the Semi's was surprising, but so was Senegal out of the first round. So I'll give you a ""few"" surprising for both. Look for Austrailia to get out of the first round. Their coach, Guus Hiddink has never finished less than 4th in World Cup, he's lead Holland and Korea to that distinguished mark. Do not think he'll make another run to 4th place but look for him to get them to the 2nd round. England is coming off a bumpy campaign to get to the World Cup, but they are highly motavated now and their team is starting to gel. Also their young talent is ridiculous with Gerrard and Lampard, two Euro Player of the Year finalists last year, and Rooney best striker in the world under 21, as well as the ""old"" talent of Owen and Beckam look for this team to do well this time and even better in 2010. Both these teams also benefit from weak groups. Usual suspects include of course Germany, Brazil, Holland, Portugal, Italy. Look for Italy to dissapoint however. They have the strongest group in the tournament and Totti has been hurt. The Czechs will look to justify their no. 2 ranking in the world within that same group. They also want to make up for their shortcomings in Euro 04. The US in the same group will advance also due to the fact that no one takes us seriously, it is to their own peril."	Sports

i should be a husband today!? . my fiancee of five years and I should be getting married today in a few hours, but here i sit at home...alone...crying my eyes out, because she is with a few guys and some nasty girls she goes to college with over in Ashland, Ky, partying the weekend away.  She just told me she didnt want to be with me a few days ago, and along with that went the marriage, and all the late night promises and love making and sweet things i had with her.  Im home on leave from the Army, and have to leave in less than 10 days...how do i get over this hurt...someone...please . First let me tell you that I'm sorry.  I know that right now you're heart is broken and you probably feel like you can't breathe.  You're hurt, angry and embarrassed. Nothing is going to make that better but time.\n\nBut as a wife, and an Army wife at that - let me say, congratulations.  I know it's impossible to see right now but she probably did you a favor.  You sound like a great guy.  Very caring and open with your feelings. You have a job that takes courage, and you have honor.  You deserve better than that.\n\nYou need a wife that will honor you, and love you no matter what. In your job you're gone a lot, to places that require you to be focused on your mission.... not just to perform well but to stay alive.  \n\nCan you imagine if you had married, then you deployed and she changed her mind then?  It takes someone really amazing to be an Army wife.  It's a tough job.  It takes a lot of committment, and stamina.  She has the ability to advance your career beyond what you can imagine right now.  And it doesn't sound like this girl new what she had in you... or what to do with it.\n\nGo out with they guys.  Spend some time with Good friends.  If you can - grab a buddy and go on a road trip.  Try and get away so everyone isn't asking about it.  Then make up a really great story about how you walked in and caught her filming a porno with a three legged midget and giraffe and kicked her to the curb to tell the guys when you get back to post.\n\nI know it doesn't seem like it..... but she may have just saved your life.  \n\nIt took me 26 years to find a guy like you, and there's nothing I wouldn't do for him.  After six years of marriage we are more in love than any couple we know.  And happier than we ever thought we would be.  You deserve that too. But we bothhad the kind of heartbreak you're having now along the way.\n\nHold on, brighter and less painful days are coming.... I promise.	Family & Relationships

May I pose a math question? . Point A and Point B are 600 miles apart.  A train leaves Point A travelling toward Point B at 5:30AM at a constant speed of 65 kph.  Another train leaves Point B heading toward Point A at 6:20AM at a constant speed of 40 kph.  What time do the two trains meet? . Ok, first you want to see where they meet. To make this easier, advance train A for 5/6ths of an hour and see the problem in terms of when train B starts out. 65 x 5/6= 325/6\nkilometers. So the problem is the same only they start out at the same time over a distance of 600- 325/6 kilometer =\n545 5/6 kilometers.\n\nNow, they travel in the proportion of 65/105 kilometers per hour. So the distance till they meet will be in the same proportion. That is 545 5/6 x 65/105 = 212875/630 or about 338 kilometers for train A to travel. Since it travels at 65 kph, this means it travels for 5.2 hours from the new start time equal to B's which was 6:20 AM. Ends up being 11:32AM.	Science & Mathematics
Is there any organization that I can give unneeded Rx to who will redistribute them to those in need? .

I was wondering if there were any organizations that exist who redistribute unneeded prescriptions to those who maybe have no insurance or just are in need. . When my father died, my mother had the same question.  There is too much liability involved, so this is not feasible.  BUT, my mom has volunteered at her local senior center for years, and she took the medications in there.  She asked around and found a few folks who used some of the same meds, so a few were used.

The sparkle and glow, I could not wait 'till he got them on the tree. There was also the smell of all the Christmas' past in that old ornament box. Half burned Christmas candles, that one ornament you wanted to put on the tree each year. Now I have that smell in my ornament box. I use C9's outside and the blinkers on the tree.

But what i love most is hearing we little girls and hearing mama and daddy's voices. sadly , i lost them both in 1991. six months apart. the other favorite holiday was last year. my sisters didn't give me anything of my dad's when he left us. i don't blame them because i went off the deep end after losing my parents. when i finally got my life together i asked them for something of my dad's. one of my sisters had my dad's wedding ring. it's beautiful, wide gold band with 3 1/4 carat diamonds. i always wanted that ring. when daddy didn't have it on i would get it and wear it while i was at their house. it was funny, mama and daddy joked about having to frisk me before i went home to make sure i didn't leave with one of their rings.LOL. anyway, i asked my sister if i could have daddy's ring. she adamently said ""NO"". it just broke my heart. my sisters were not fair when it came to splitting what my parents had 3 ways. i asked her for that ring for 5 years. last year my birthday fell on thanksgiving day. we were all at my sisters house having our family dinner when out came a beautiful cake with far too many candles on it LOL. i was surprised. i read all of the b-day cards and opened the gifts everyone had given me. i noticed everyone moving to one side of the room and my nieces all had cameras and video camears pointed at me when i opened the last gift. IT WAS MY DADDY'S RING !!!!!!!! I started bawlin' and ran to my lil sister to hug and thank her. my sis is an itty bitty thing and i'm NOT...she told everyone to protect her so i wouldn't sqeeze her to death !!LOL i have that ring on my finger right now and that is where it will stay until one of my nephews is old enough and getting married. that is when i will pass it down. so, that's just 2 of many wonderful holidays. as a matter of fact my b-day is on sat. and we are having thanksgiving then. everyone has to work on fri. so we decided to do it on sat. so everyone can be there. we're having it at my sisters house and she lives an hour 1/2 away. well , there's my answer.  OH !!! and you are soo right about time screaming by. That is sad.  Have a great Thanksgiving. God Bless.\n                                                                   Deanne"	Society & Culture
"structured cabling network?  how do fiber optic cable work in the structured cabling network? .  . Fiber optic cables offer two big advantages over traditional copper in a network:  they are immune to electromagntic interference, and they can run much much further than copper without needing repeaters.  The bigest two disadvantages to fiber are that they are more expensive, and that the standards are still evolving.\n\nBoth of those disadvantages are going away, though, meaning that I strongly believe fiber is going to completely replace copper eventually.  Right now, many companies are ""future proofing"" by running fiber along with copper in walls so that if they need to upgrade to fiber in the future, it is already part of thier structured network.  Also, major backbones, either running between campuses or even just between wings or floors of a building are now more and more fiber only, because it just makes sense when you're already paying so much money to set up the backbone.\n\nThe source below is a tutorial on my company's website giving more details about fiber."

Another pigeonhole principle question? . Show that if 101 integers are chosen from 1 to 200 inclusive, there must be 2 with the property that one is divisible by the other. . Take a simpler case choosing 21 numbers from 1 to 40. Here are 20 boxes:\n\n1 2 4 8 16 32\n3 6 12 24\n5 10 20 40\n7 14 28\n9 18 36\n11 22\n13 26\n:\n:\n19 38\n21\n23\n:\n:\n37\n39\n\nThis set of 20 boxes contains all the numbers from 1 to 40. Choose any 21 numbers from 1 to 40. By the Pigeon Hole Principle two of these numbers are in the same box. For example it could be the box containing 7 14 28. Then  the smaller of the two numbers divides the larger of the two numbers.\n\nThis should allow you to make your own proof.	Science & Mathematics

"Would an Intel Pro/Wireless 3945ABG Card work on a WLAN that recommends either a IPW 2915ABG or 2200BG Card? . I am considering purchasing a Tablet PC with an Intel Core Duo Processor (which has an internal IPW 3945ABG card and supports 802.11ab&g) a to use at a college that recommends laptop users to have either an IPW 2200BG or 2915ABG card. Both IPW 2200 and 2915 are supported by the Intel Pentium M Processor (which I would not prefer over the newer Intel Core Duo Processor). I would like to know if the IPW 3945 of the Intel Core Duo Processor is compatible with either the IPW 2200 or 2915. . The a, b, and g concern themselves with the college's wireless network.  If I'm not mistaken, a operates at 1.0Mbps, b at 11Mbps, and g at 54Mbps.  They are all based on the wireless standard 802.11...that's why the boxes say 802.11a, 802.11b, 802.11g, or a combination of the above.  You have to talk to the college to see what type of network they have: an ""a/b"" card will not work on a ""g"" network.  But as long as you get a card with all three (a/b/g), no matter who makes it, you should still be able to get online.  Just remember to get the college's access keys and your computer named (it should be done for you automatically) on the network."	Computers & Internet
"Does anyone else think that the American south is a complete write-off? . and, in hindsight, should've been allowed to secede from the Union?  I mean come on, really.  The South used to be purely Democrat, remember the ""Southern Democrat""?  But ever since blacks gained the right to vote (w/o poll taxes), the Dixiecrats suddenly became conservative Republican because Dems wanted civil rights for blacks.  You have states like Texas that allowed itself to be Gerrymandered beyond recognition and Tennessee who still celebrate the Scopes Monkey trial victory.  If in November and in the aftermath of Katrina and Rita, there are not more Democratic senators, governors, and congressmen from the South, I propose we just cut them loose.  MS and LA are STILL in shambles but yet there is a Republican in office?!  Where's the love?  The fact is is that they will elect Reps b/c all the whites (who vote rep) had enough money and means to escape and rebuild later than 90% of all the blacks (who vote dem) who stayed and suffered. . No. Abe Lincoln goofed big time. I can't believe some consider him a great president. He should have sought compromises with the South. Sure the South was making a fortune on cotton trading to Europe, thus making the South wealthy, yet Lincoln was stubborned and ended getting us involved in a civil war, that should never have happened.\n\nYet, I agree with you about the lack of Democrats in the south. Once a bastion of democratic thought, now it's all Republicans. What a catastrophe for the Democratic party. It seems the only Democratic president that has a chance of getting elected has to be from the south like Jimmy Carter or Bill Clinton.\n\nAs far as the race issue, it's a problem. Yet it could have been straighten out during Lincoln's time by requiring the southern plantation owners to pay for labor and to abolish slavery. That problem should have been worked on long ago instead of getting into a civil war. Nevertheless, the fact that the South was making all that money on cotton was a reason most forget that lead to a civil war.\n\nAnyway, things could change. The south could return to its democratic tendencies. At least I hope so for the sake of this country. By the way, I'm not from the south, I'm from a burb of NYC."	Politics & Government

"Einstein's Theory.? . Who believes in Einstein's Theory of Relativity and why? There is one answer. . All a theory does is attempt to explain evidence.  If it does a good job explaining evidence, and if it stands up to being able to predict the results of future experiments, then it has a lot going for it.  Relativity theory does a good job of explaining a lot of experimental evidence that had 19th century physicists scratching their heads.  Special relativity helped explain the results of the Michelson-Morley experiment, which showed that the speed of light is essentially the only thing on which any two inertial observers can agree; general relativity was able to predict the curving of light around the sun and explain the precession of the perihelion of Mercury's orbit, and a myriad of other phenomena since.  Unfortunately, general relativity and quantum mechanics don't play very well together.  Since quantum mechanics ALSO does a good job of explaining a lot of things, we start to look for ways of describing the universe which include both the relativistic and quantum viewpoints.  (One can loosely think of relativity describing ""big"" objects and distances, and quantum theory describing ""small"" objects and distances.)  There have been big inroads made in this effort (quantum field theory), but no firm answers yet.  What is needed to validate a theory is to take the theory's predictions and compare them to experimental results.  I'm not a physicist, and I don't know where the current state of research is as regards testing such predictions.  Just bear in mind that, even if some flavor of QFT becomes the ""new"" relativity theory so to speak, it doesn't completely invalidate relativity theory.  After all, we still use the techniques of Newtonian physics for many things (the first quarter of any freshman level physics class in college is largely thanks to Newton!), because even though Newtonian techniques don't provide the correct answer (as say, compared to the techniques of general relativity), the error produced is often so small that it would be darn near impossible to tell the difference."

Matter or fact, some universities does offers Yiddish as language being offered as it is parralel to Jew. In fact, German linguists also learn Yiddish because the development of the German language, is related to the medieval versions of it that today are manifested only in Yiddish.\nThe best answer is Israel because of the origins and nowadays situations.

I was once told that there are more possible games of chess than there are atoms in the universe.? . This was told to me by a physics student. Can it be true? . It's a bit of a philosophical question.  The number of moves is roughly 10^134 (ten to the power of 134).  Since the universe is basically infinite, and 10^134 is definately fininite, then nope it's not true.  \nAnother approach is to consider that there are roughly between 10^12 or 10^13 cells in every human on the planet.  Roughly 12 persons contain as many cells as there are moves in chess.  That *cells* not atoms.  Each cell can be millions of atoms, so as you can see chess moves are no where near the number of atoms in even a dozen human beings!	Science & Mathematics

Not able to find it?? Can you solve it? . Two friends pooled money to buy a pen costing 50$(25$+25$). After they went the shop owner said to the sales person that they are our regular customer so give them discount and return 5$. Sales person took a cab to reach them paying 2$ for cab and returned rest 3$.They got 1.5$ each returned. To each friend pen costs 23.5$(25$ -1.5$).\nIf we add there contribution(23.5+23.5=47$) and cab fair(2$) it comes out to be 49$ in stead of 50$. \nWhere is 1& lost :)  ?? . Nothing is lost. Their contribution is 47$ (23.5 $ each). This sum includes the 2$ for the cab, so the 2$ should not be added again to get the 49 sum.\n\n25$   25$\n---------\n1.5   1.5.......back\n1     1.........cab\n22.5  22.5......pen cost\n---------\n25$   25$\n\n=>Each paid 23.5$, the shop received 45 (22.5 from each), and the cab received 2$(1 from each).

what did george bush mean when he said that immigrants are crucial to the economy? .  . Immigrants are crucial to the economy in that they are frequently employed in low-paying jobs, which native Americans (as in non-immigrants, note that native is not capitalized) would not do for the same wages.  This allows business, particularly in the agricultural sect, to turn a larger profit, which in turns allows them to buy things that help other businesses.  Ultimately, that money that would have gone to paying US-born workers is distrubuted to other areas of the economy instead.\n\nAlso, illegal immigrants often work for significantly below minimum wage in conditions that violate numerous labor laws.  If they complain, they'll be deported.  This further increases the effect discribed above.\n\nOne of the previous answered mentioned some convoluted tax scheme.  While this line of reasoning may be correct (although I would be inclined to say that the majority of illegal immigrants don't pay income taxes), I believe that the low wages are a far more significant economic factor.

Why are my eyes out of focus when I wake up, often for upto 15 minutes even? . Usually just one eye also, I can't really figure this one out. . I would try a few things before going to the eye doctor IF you are in pretty good health. It might be something just out of habit or common sense thats causing your body to wake up this way. \n\n1st thing I would try for 3-4 days straight is to jump in a hot shower as soon as you wake up. Make sure you hit your face and eyes and hair with a good cleaning. I suspect various body oils from your hair and/ or skin are getting into your eyes through out the night.\n\n2nd thought: Your body is low on nutrition and/or water first thing in the morning. With dehydration and the lack of vitamins, your eyes are suffering. Some people this matters, other people dont ever need vitamins. Depends how strong your gene set is and what other not so great habits you intake like smoking or drinking. So my suggestion is when you wake up and during sleep, have some vitamin water next to your bed and drink up. Then as soon as you wake up go make yourself a healthy vitamin liquid shake and see how your eyes react. \n\n3rd: Sounds silly but do some form of stretching and mild exercise like walk up some stairs slowlllyyyy 4-6 times. See if your eyes are coming better into focus then. I suspect maybe some kind of position in which you sleep is cutting off the oxygen and/or bloodflow to your eye area. Some people sleep face down on their hands in the face, this would be an example. \n\n4th: Sleep apnea is another suspect---try BREATH RIGHTS strips for 7-10 nights on your nose. See if you wake up more refreshed and your eyes arent as blurry. You might have a breathing problem the way you sleep. 1 out of every 7 adults sleep in some harmful way that is NOT healthy for the breathing --doesnt matter if you are overweight or unhealthy.  \n\nShould be very interesting to see what combinations of this or that above helps you out. Email me and let me know how it goes ok? Good luck.	Health

Everyone works for money, and not only for himself/herself, but for all the people around him/her.  Johnny went to Yangkees not only because the money, but Yangkees gave him more recognition than Rod Sox did.\n\nNomar signed with Cubs for 2004-2005, but spent most of the time in DL.  He is with Dodgers now, and playing pretty well (.333 AVG, 4 HR and 18 RBI in 66 at-bats).	Sports

Is a proposal after 9 months of dating too soon? .  . Depends on the people.  How much do you REALLY talk and know each other.  How much of the relationship is more about the physical or superficial?  If you love each other for the hearts and souls that you're bringing into the relationship, then go for it.  If you're unsure about that at all, wait a bit and see how you feel in a few more months.  Good luck.	Family & Relationships
How do u kno u lead a happy life? .  . Do you feel excited about life?  Are you proud of your accomplishments?  Do you enjoy your work, your relationships, your lifestyle?  Do you find yourself smiling often?  If so, then you're probably happy.  Do you lie awake in bed at night and worry and fret and feel miserable?  Do you fight a lot with the other people in your life?  Do you use food, alcohol, or drugs to make you feel better?  Do you drag your feet through the day, wishing you were somewhere--anywhere--else?  If so, then you probably aren't happy.  There are a lot of places in between, and that's where most of us fall on any given day.  The question you have to ask yourself is whether you feel happy more often than you feel miserable, and if not, then evaluate what things or people are contributing to your unhappiness...and make some changes.

"i wanr to know about forency in details? . what forency is all about . Forensic science (often shortened to forensics) is the application of a broad spectrum of sciences to answer questions of interest to the legal system. This may be in relation to a crime or to a civil action. The use of the term ""forensics"" in place of ""forensic science"" could be considered incorrect; the term ""forensic"" is effectively a synonym for ""legal"" or ""related to courts"" (from Latin, it means ""before the forum""). However, it is now so closely associated with the scientific field."	Science & Mathematics

Why do we become cold when we are over-tired? . I.e. sleep deprivation leads to shivering/chills in many people: why? how is this adaptive? . I think it is because you body is not functioning at its best when someone is tired.

It's because your body is working harder to digest the food and the other bodily functions slow down.  That's also why we feel tired after over-eating.	Science & Mathematics

i want to buy real estate for rental income but need to start with little money? . i live in a college town and there are a ton of rental properties around and i want a peice of that pie. how do i go about buying with little money down . I think most of the no money down, subject to, and lease option stuff is crap.  Perhaps after you have gained experience you can get deals no money down.  I lived in a college town also and saw the same thing happening in my town.  Rentals were everywhere.  I got started in real estate as a birddog.  I made $500 finding leads for an investor.  $10/ per lead he didn't have to close for me to be compensated.  There are only so many investment opportunities in one market though, so now after much debate I am becoming a realtor. Then I plan on being a commercial broker and THEN an investor. It is gonna take a while. I really think that you need the money/ experience/ connections/knowledge before getting into such a heavy endeavor with such thick legal implications and even scarier liabilities/consequences. If you don't know what you are doing you can get hauled off to jail for 3rd degree felonies with that no money down garbage.

Are Windows Drivers supported by Ubuntu? . I was thinking about making the switch over to Ubuntu Linux but I was wondering if all my drivers that I have on CDs and such for my PCMCIA cards if they would work with Ubuntu. Anyone know? . No your drivers will not work. \n\nUbuntu has its own drivers to run just about everything that is common on most PCs. I would not expect to have a hard time getting CD drives, modems, and LAN cards to work. If you have a multi function printer/fax machine...you may be out of luck.\n\nThe major exception is Wireless cards. There is a program called NdisWrapper that will allow you to use some Windows drivers to activate Wireless cards if Ubuntu does not have them already.\n\nMy suggestion is to use the Ubuntu live CD. This will let you use the system and see what hardware is supported before you try a full install.	Computers & Internet

"road map to peace? . Does anyone agree that although the US & UK are involved in an illegal was in Iraq ( confirmed by Kiof Annan)\nthey got their co-ordinates wrong...the real issue lies with the illegal occupation of Palestinian lands.\nthis issue needs to be addressed urgently to secure peace for the region.\nBin Laden has stated he attacke America on 9/11 because of it bias towards Israel.\nIf Israel were to give back land seized in 1967,return to those borders and quit building illegal Jewish settlements on Arab land,the root cause for Al-Quaeda would be gone...they would have no more angst . Your idea of appeasement does sound well-founded, I'll grant you that. But what happens if you give a mouse a cookie? He'll want a glass of milk to wash it down with. The problem isn't just the fact Israel has those lands to Middle-Eastern peoples, it's also the fact that Israel exists.\n\nLets look at how past appeasement worked. We're going on a history lesson back to the 1930's. Hitler's military taking of the Rhineland was against the Treaty of Versailles, and should have been faced with military action. However, fearing another world war like the first, France and Great Britain appeased his hunger by letting him have it. Hitler admitted later that, ""The forty-eight hours after the march into the Rhineland were the most nerve-racking in my life. If the French had then marched into the Rhineland we would have had to withdraw with our tails between our legs, for the military resources at our disposal would have been wholly inadequate for even a moderate resistance.""\n\n The Munich Agreement of 1938 was where Neville Chamberlain the Prime Minister of Britain, gave up more land to Hitler to appease his hunger and prevent the war theat was unknowingly coming. Every military of occupational action Hitler took, up to the invasion of France, was allowed by the powers of Europe, viewed as ""necessary to prevent another World War."" Worked wonders, didn't it.\n\nAppeasement won't work. And I don't have the time to type all I have to say about Kofi Annan, but I can summarize it in the fact that it's not very nice to him, and it's the truth."	Politics & Government

I have a TI-84 but I'm sure the syntax must be the same.\n\nUnder the Math category, towards the bottom you will find the NDERIV() function. Select that and enter in: NDERIV(f(x),x,c) where f(x) is the function you are evaluating, with respect to x (it should always be x, unless you are using another variable), at point c.\n\nFor example, to evaluate derivative of y=x^2 at 3, you would enter NDERIV(x^2,x,3) and simply hit enter.\n\nAn alternate method is to graph the function and select dy/dx calculation at the point you want to evaluate the derivative.\n\nI know that on the TI-89 a ""|"" is used to separate the first two arguements from ""c"", try that if it doesn't work.\n\nNote that the calculator finds the derivative by calculating the slope +/- 0.01 from the point you choose, not by evaluating limits. This can lead to answers that are completely wrong, use discretion when you choose to use the NDERIV function."	Science & Mathematics

Most burnable CD's can hold around 80 minutes, so you could burn three 25 minute comedy programs onto one CD.\n\nThe hardware necessary to burn CD's is a CD burner.  You can buy one at almost any electronics store (Best Buy, for instance).  Ask any sales associate to help you find the best one for your computer.\n\nBurning a CD requires either Windows Media Player (WMP) or an actual burning software.

what materials are used for making a sound proof generator which was normal generator? . normal generator was 90-95dB\nSOUND PROOF 60-65dB . Here are a few ideas on reducing generator noise, taken from my generator web site.\nhttp://members.rennlist.org/warren/generator.html\n\nChoose an operating location as far away as possible. Note that a larger gauge wire is needed to reduce voltage drop as line length increases. Reducing line loss is required to minimize power loss and to ensure maximum power is available to the house. Lights will flicker less when heavy loads are attached. \n\nChange the exhaust system. Noise from the portable generator systems comes primarily from two sources, the engine block and the exhaust system. With an air cooled engine there is little you can do about block noise. Some engines can have a larger muffler attached or make other changes to the exhaust system. Merely mounting exhaust pipe vertically will noticeably reduce noise. \n\nBuild a noise shielding enclosure. This could be as simple as a piece of plywood to reflect sound away from the house to a separate shed to hold the generator. Design your enclosure with safety in mind. Provide adequate air circulation and ventilation to prevent heat buildup and to remove carbon monoxide. \n\nIf the noise bothers your neighbors, invite them over for coffee or offer to run line to their home to power the freezer or a few lights. Talk to them before starting the engine, ask they let you know if the noise is bothersome before they phone the police or harbor any resentment. A little diplomacy can go a long way. \n\nLast resort, shut off the engine or buy a quiet generator.	Science & Mathematics

"How do those Christians who take the Bible literally, deal with its contradictions? . Please, no ""pat"" answers, just simple honesty.  Thanks. . I totally agree with the inference of your question. I have read the answers and looked up a suggested site that presents both sides of the argument - a very good reference.\nMy pet (pun intended) contradiction is about the number of birds that went into Noah's Ark. Gen. 6:20 â  Gen. 7:3  \n\nFirst let me say, that I only see a literal contradiction, the meaning or spirit of the story of Noah and the flood is far more important than the contradictions in detail.\n\nThe explanation by the apologist is that the reference to two animals refers to the order the animals boarded the Ark, so allowing for seven pairs of the same species of animal.\n\nFor me, a reasonable explanation of the difference is that one root story (Ch 6) came from a tribe  where the animals would be seen as only being needed for propagation, while the other root story (Ch 7) was from a tribe where, clean animals would have been needed for food supplies as well as propagation.\n\nThe answer to your question is I suggest, that those who hold to a literal interpretation, deny the contradiction by going to extreem lengths of explaination to maintain the possibility of literal truth.  They do this because literal truth is an easier to argue, than finding a compassionate integration of God's message into the reality of human life."	Society & Culture

Try stimulating her clitoris.  That's where all the nerve endings are (it has more nerve endings as your penis, but packed into a much smaller area and is the ONLY organ in the human body whose sole purpose is pleasure.)  If she finds direct stimulation too sensitive, you can stimulate her clitoris indirectly by moving the hood of skin over it.  If by fingering you mean inserting a finger into her vagina, you're basically missing the boat.  Very few women will orgasm that way (some girls do enjoy stimulation of the g-spot, but most women orgasm primarily from clitoral stimulation.)  If you do want to find her g-spot, it's on the front wall of the vagina, about an inch or so in; you should feel a grainy feeling knot of skin.

"social construction of language? . essay/report type answers . Languages such as koine Greek and Biblical Hebrew are considered dead languages... they don't change from century to century because no one uses them in daily context. The King James Bible that is read by most conservative Christians today is in it's 16 revision since the original in 1600's. Reason being is that language is constantly changing. Things happen... for instance people go from being decision makers to ""deciders"" and the word catches on in popular usage and is incorporated into the common language. Once it makes it's way to accepted parts of speech it is incorporated into lexical documentation and is included in dictionaries and such. \n\nThe pool of language increases and decreases every day as the new is adopted and the antiquated is avoided such as thee and thou in the English language. With the advent of the internet, the social construction of language is accelerated dramatically since you can read blogs, news blurbs from just about anywhere in the world. Hope this helps."

"How can you make the work output of a machine greater than the work input? . -by decreasing friction\n-by increasing the input force\n-by increasing the output distance\n-none of the above\nPLEASE DONT JUST GUESS ...GIVE ME AN ANSWER AND EXPLAIN IT. . You cannot.  The law of conservation of energy states in lay language that energy can be neither created nor destroyed.  Therefore, getting more work out of a machine than is put into it is not possible.  In practical terms, even 100% efficiency, which would be getting an equal amount of work output, is not possible since some energy will always be lost due to forces such as friction.  Two terms describing the state where work output is greater than work input are ""perpetual motion"" and ""free energy.""  Unfortunately, neither one can exist."	Science & Mathematics

Washington DC also has 3 representatives (but no Senators), so there are a total of 538 electors. \n\nA candidate needs 270 electoral votes to be elected President (269 would be half of 538, so you need one more than half of 538).\n\nAs a rule, which ever candidate gets the most votes from each state gets all of the electoral votes from that state .\n\nSo it's not enough to simply get the majority of the popular vote, you have to get the marjoirty of the popular vote in enough statest to add up to 270 electoral votes.\n\nIf no candidate received 270 electoral votes, then the election would be decided by a vote of the 435 members of the House of Representatives.\n\nThe electoral college voters actually meet (in their own individual states) to vote on the first Monday after the second Wednesday in December...THAT is when the President is officially ""elected""."

Would Taiwan really separate from the mainland China? .  . No, whether it's rich or poor across the strait, whether how the politics, culture or the ecomnomy develops across the strait, it is NO excuse of apart the China.\nI think in every country, for instance, in America, there are always disbalance in development of economy between so many states. But that can not be an excuse for secession.( I don't think a patriot america can agree with it).\nNowadays the East Germany and the West still has a distance in society advance, but they are one country!\nIn China there are cities such as Shanghai, Beijing or provinces like Zhejiang, Jiangsu and Guangdong which are well developed against the poor western-middle areas. Could they declare their independence?\nAnd in Hongkong, it is far developed than any other city in PR.China, it still belongs to China and, what's most, the taking over of Hongkong seems do not hurt its society prosperity.\n\nDo no show off Taiwan's well-off and slam the mainland's porverty, or democracy and dictatorship with them.(and the situations are changing...wake up from the dream and look forward pls.)  Maybe it's the status quo but they do have nothing to do with the excuse of splitting Taiwan for China!\nOnce and again and again, No one will hurt Taiwan or any other part on it's sociaty prosperity. on the contrary, the Chinese are striving to avoiding of hurting from some aggressive and ill-disposed countries, and from some ones in Taipei who don't think of the whole Chinese area with his brain but with his bigmouth.\n\nSee a democrative vote: how many counties on the earth agree that Taiwan is a country rather than a part of China? Less than 25(all little ones) That's all. Taiwan is not a county, pls don't dream on it.\nThe world are waiting for Taiwan, no, some extreme infantile taiwanese ,to learn how to tell his family, from to the pacific and the Japan sea.

If you manage it in exactly that number of shots, it's a par....so say you were at the first tee and it said you had to take 5 shots to get the ball in the hole, so you hit the ball 5 times & got it in the hole...then you've got a par. But if you only take 4 shots to get it in the hole, then it's birdie because you're one under the par. And an eagle is 2 under the par...so you'd do it in 3.\nI hope that sort of makes sense...I'm rubbish at explaining things!!!	Sports

Describe how the process of respiration occurs and all factors involved in this process? .  . a) When you inhale, air goes through your nostrils and into you air ways all the way to your lungs.\nb) Inside your lungs are small alveoli that capture O2 molecules and trap them for your red cells to start working.\nc) Each red cell is like a carrier that excahnges O2 molecules for CO2 moluecules (those of used air on your bloodstream)\nd) Red cells go through your blood to every tiny place in your body giving oxygen where is needed and taking CO2 back to the lungs.  Your lungs get rid off those CO2 molecules when you exhale.\ne) You heart pumps blood in two directions:  It makes the blood with carbon dioxide (CO2) go to the lungs and the blood that is oxygen rich, go to all your body.  Your brain is the primary oxygen client in your body.	Science & Mathematics

"Do you know any non-Christians that ""celebrate"" Christmas? What do you think about that? . By ""celebrate"" I mean putting up a tree, decorating, exchanging gifts. Partaking in the secular aspects of the holiday without worshipping.\n\nDo you think this enhances, diminshes or has no effect on the religious aspects of this particular holiday? . I think it has no effect on it.  Considering that putting up a tree, decorating and exchanging gifts are completely unbiblical and the pagan part of this pagan rooted holiday- to me it seems more appropriate that nonbelievers celebrate it than believers.  \nChristmas is a dressed up and renamed pagan feast that still retains much of its original pagan tradition.  The addition of ""Jesus in the manger"" is a nice touch but the fact is Jesus is not in the manger, and while it is good to remember this Biblical account- it does not end there and pick back up at Easter where he is on the cross. He is now risen and reigning at the right hand of the Father.\nBecause Christmas and Easter are pagan rooted man made tradition and not God instituted, they do not give a perfect, complete and nonconfusing picture of who Jesus really is.  Christians should be looking to the feasts that God instituted-  we have been decieved into believing that these are Jewish feasts that are no longer valid, the fact is Jesus celebrated them and they are altogether a perfect picture, giving clear and beautiful understanding of who our Messiah is and our relationship with Him.\nWhy would God invalidate the perfect feasts, the wonderful celebrations He instituted for His people in exchange for pagan, imperfect ritual that when it comes down to it is nothing more than strange fire?\nAt this point in our culture Christmas is one of two things,  a tradition so ingrained that one cannot let go even though the stress of outdoing the other or last year to get the best gift for everyone and live the rest of the year in debt dreading next Christmas, or a time to celebrate friends and family, a time to relax from the hustle and bustle of the year, reflect on the blessings and slow down to celebrate family-  if the nonbelievers (and believers alike)  are celebrating the way of celebrating family, more power to them - from what I observed the nonbelievers know more about the origin of Christmas and what the traditions really mean than the believers do and that if nothing else should be humbling and convicting to the heart of the believer!"

It is a time of introspection, so you may find it necessary to withdraw from life a little bit and go off by yourself. It is a good time to write about your contemplation, as your perception goes deeper now and you have the opportunity to tap into ""higher knowledge"", which could certainly benefit others as well as yourself. The 7 vibration is surrounded by an air of mysticism from ancient times. It governs the musical scale, the color spectrum, and even the days of our week. It is a time of completion.\n\nPersonal Month: 9\nTie up loose ends. Finish your projects and clean up. Don't start anything new this month, unless it's a month long something.

You are inspired and surrounded by white light so wear rainbow colors and listen to your intuition. Spiritual things are flowing smoothly today.\n\nLife Path or Destiny: 1\nThe Destiny number describes the life lessons that we have come here to learn. It reveals to us the path we must take, and the role we must play to fulfill our mission. Often our choice of career is based on this vibration, and if not, then it will manifest through avocational pursuits. We may attract people and experiences into our lives that mirror the traits of this number for us, so that we may develop into our highest potential. We don't always welcome our life lessons, so it is a possibility that we may even feel an aversion to the characteristics of our Destiny number in other people, and we may ourselves act the opposite. In spite of the many ways we may choose to react to this force within us, we have been gifted with all of the talents and energy needed to fulfill our Destiny. You are a pioneer. Independent, original and strong willed you have all of the tools of leadership and self-mastery. You must learn to use your courage, creativity and unique individuality to steadfastly make your dreams come true. Inventor, originator, initiator your key word is discover.\n\nCycles\nThe destiny is divided into 3 great cycles, each governing us for specific durations throughout our life. The Seed cycle begins at birth and colors our experiences through childhood and adolescence. During the year nearest our 28th birthday, we move into the Fruit cycle which remains throughout the middle part of our life until the year nearest our 56th birthday, and the Harvest cycle carries on from there. Taken all together, the cycles show us our particular path that will lead to the fulfillment of our destiny.\n\nSeed: 1\nWhen 1 is the seed cycle it is more difficult, as the child is surrounded by other people guiding their life, and the inner desire for independence, freedom and self-motivation can lead to conflicts with authority or withdrawal.\n\nFruit: 7\nThis is a period of quiet introspection, study and rest. There are likely to be many bookshelves filled during this time of intellectual and spiritual discovery. Law and physics as the underlying foundation of life are studied, and profound realizations emerge. Technical writing, teaching, law or any kind of scientific research is strongly supported now. Everything needed comes to you when you stop looking for it.\n\nHarvest: 2\n""Togetherness"" is the theme of this cycle. They are rarely alone, and social invitations abound.

"When do we see India a Developed Country in all respects? . Being an Indian civilian, I was watching India since my childhoold that it is a developing country.  I want to see India as a developed Country before my death. . The present day India is far advanced than ""a developed nation"" in terms of 1970s or 1980s. Let me be clear in that..... what I meant to say is.... if you look back in 1970s or 1980s, the countries we termed as developed had lesser development compared to present day India. So in a way, we can say India is already developed. The problem comes when we try to compare it with present day USA or UK or JAPAN and like-wise. \n\nI think, being a developed nation doesnt necessarily have to be full of skyscrapers. It could be reflected in other aspects too. India's economy is growing in a spectacular pace, software industry is booming, foreign investment is booming, companies world wide are not thinking twice to jump into indian market, cell phone industry is so successful that you have better mobile pieces and global rates in India than in other countries. Everybody carries a cell phone in India. I mean..Everybody! Communication barriers has been lift. Social changes and awareness are occuring in a steady pace. With so many things happening, India is developed is already developed. \nWell...if you want to hear ""developed nation"" on papers...I think its not too far.

"what are the rules for analogies? please tell me? . I have to do a project on these rules please help . How Do I Solve an Analogy?\n\nSolving analogies is a terrific way to sharpen your thinking skills and prepare for standardized tests. An analogy is a type of word problem that consists of two word pairs, like the following example:\n\nGRACEFUL : CLUMSY :: HOT: _______\n\nFind a word that correctly completes the second pair. At first glance, the words in an analogy may seem to have nothing to do with each other, but the words are always logically related. The first pair of words has a relationship similar to the second pair of words. To solve the analogy, you need to figure out that relationship.\n\nRead the analogy like this:\n\n""Graceful is to clumsy as hot is to 'blank.'""\n\nAsk yourself: What's the relationship between graceful and clumsy? These words are antonyms -- they have opposite meanings -- so the second pair of words must also be antonyms. Fill in the blank with a word that means the opposite of ""hot"", and you've solved the analogy. The best answer is ""COLD."" If you find an unfamiliar word in an analogy, use a dictionary to check its meaning.\n\nCommon Analogy Types\n\nIn addition to antonyms, the word pairs in an analogy often have one of the following types of relationships:\n\n* Synonyms: Words that have the same or similar meanings, as in\nUNHAPPY : SAD\n\n*Antonyms: Words that have opposite meanings, as in OPEN : CLOSED\n\n* Descriptive: One word describes the other word, as in\nFAST : CHEETAH\n\n* Part to whole (or whole to part): One word is a part or piece of the other, as in\nPIECE : PUZZLE\n\n* Item to category: One word names an item that falls into the group named by the other word, as in BASEBALL : SPORTS BALLS\n\nHere's another example:\n\nPUPPY : DOG :: KITTEN : _______\n\nThe analogy is read: ""Puppy is to dog as kitten is to 'blank.'"" The first pair of words is not related in any of the ways listed above. Try reading the analogy as a sentence that expresses the relationships between the words: ""A puppy is a young dog, as a kitten is a young. . .""? ""CAT"" is the best answer."	Education & Reference

why is the wealth of the world controlled by so few, while so many suffer and starve? .  . Well, the majority of your answers will probably have something to do with people being greedy or the rich having all the power or something like that.  While part of that is true, the other part of it is that no other system works.\n\nCommunism: the idea is great.  Everybody is equal, everybody has a job, everybody has the same income, etc.  Great idea, bad policy.  It doesn't work.  It's worked in a few countries, but over long periods of time, it always fails. Why?  Because there's no incentive to do well.  There's no incentive to get a better education, or to try to move up.  While the rich may seem to control a lot, and there may seem to be so much poverty, that's the best way for the world to run.  Seriously.  The poor have to work harder to move up.  The harder they work, the more they get paid, the more they can afford, etc.\n\nThat's the idea, anyway.  It doesn't always work, but it's a good start.  And where do the poor get their money from?  The rich.  And where do the rich get their products form?  The poor.  And where do we get hard workers who are dedicated?  From the incentive to advance through the ranks so that the poor can become the rich.\n\nPersonally, I tend to blame the poor more than anything for their situation.  See, I come from a low-income family.  I'm 20, and have found a way to get into college.  I've got  a 4.0 gpa, I hold a job, I spend time in the summer volunteering with children, and I coach baseball.  I do all of that while writing bad checks to pay the electric and phone bill.  So, what do I do to get by?  I work harder, I treat others right, and I've gained respect in the community.  What has that done for my family?  Well, you'd be surprised.  Now, I get treated well by people in the community, nobody looks down on me, and people offer to help me out.  Why?  Because I've spent my time helping others.  \n\nBasically, if the poor spent more time helping others, doing good deeds, working hard, helping the community, instead of committing crimes (the highest crime rate is among poor people), the community would have a better view of them, and might offer more help to them.  I'm not saying they would always, but in general, I think the situation for the poor would be better.\n\nThere's one other explanation that I'd like to share on why the poor seem to get poorer and the rich get richer.  The reason is minimum wage.  Let me expand a bit, so you can understand:\n\n\n\n1.When you raise minimum wage, there are two things that can happen.  When the minimum wage is raised, businesses are not going to profit as much, and smaller businesses especially will have to compensate.  To compensate, they either have to raise their prices or eliminate some employees.\n\nA.If you raise your prices, then the minimum wage increase is wiped out for those that got a pay raise.  Since only those making less than the new minimum wage would get an increase in pay, anyone making more than that would have to pay more for the same amount.  This means that the cost of living goes up, along with inflation.  This means that there will be more people living in poverty, the rich wonât be affected, and the middle-class will be even more strapped for cash.  Also note that the price increase will be felt throughout the factories making the product, the shipping companies, the storage companies, and the marketplace. The old adage âthe rich get richer...â comes true again.\n\nB.If you eliminate employees, there are fewer jobs, which means that fewer people will have an income.  This will be felt in all areas of the workforce, as previously described, again meaning that the rich get richer. . . .  Inflation is still abound and the cost of living increases.  Now, since companies have a smaller workforce that is making more money, companies can do several things.\n\ni.Companies can now increase the costs of products since those at the bottom end are making more mo	Politics & Government

"Why does the singapore symbol is a mix of a lion and a mermaid? .  . It's called the Merlion.\nThe Merlion and its Significance\nThe choice of the Merlion as a symbol for Singapore has its roots in history, The Merlion commemorates the ancient name and the legend taken from the ""Malay Annals"" (literary and historical work from the 15th or 16th century) explaining how Singapore received its present name. \n\nIn ancient times, Singapore was known as Temasek which is Javanese for the sea. It was then, as it is today, a centre of trade. \n\nAt the end of the 4th century A.D, Temasek was destroyed by the Siamese, according to some historians, but by the Javanese according to others. As recorded in the legend in the Malay Annals,"" Prince Nila Utama of the Sri Vijaya empire rediscovered the island later in the 11th century A.D. On seeing a strange beast (which he later learnt was a lion) upon his landing he named the island Singapura which is a Sanskrit word for Lion (Singa) City (Pura).\n\nThe Merlion, with its fish-like body riding the waves of the sea, is symbolic of the ancient city of Temasek. At the same time, its majestic head recalls the legend of the discovery of Singapore by Prince Nila Utama in the 11th century, when Singapore received its present"	Politics & Government

I have made several mistakes in this answer alone, both grammatical and linguitically, but that is how I communicate, and the way that makes the most sense to me, despite the mistakes. Perhaps my individuality and uniqueness is expressed through my mistakes, and therefore to eliminate those mistakes would change my language tone and emphasis to becomeing more mainstream, all for the sake of being colloquially correct. I prefer to hang on to my unique mannerisms, precisely because they are warped and twisted. Thats me, expressing myself through the power of word and phrase, tone and emphasis."	Computers & Internet
Can someone tell me about the legends surrounding Muhammed's Birth? . Or give me a good link either will suffice . His father died before he was born, and his mother died when he was only six. But sheltered by a powerful uncle, he made a good start in life, established himself in a profitable business and married well. Then, at the age of 40, he was transformed. A man who could not read or write, he announced that he was the prophet of God. His name was Muhammad, and in the next 23 years he would bring peace to the warring pagan tribes of Arabia and establish the religion of Islam, which today has 1.2 billion followers.\n\nThree years in the making and fueled by an unprecedented grassroots funding campaign, Muhammad: Legacy of a Prophet, travels in the footsteps of the prophet to the Arabian desert and the holy city of Mecca where much of Muhammad's story unfolded. But the film does not just stay in the past. Much of its story is told through the observations of contemporary American Muslims, including a fireman at the World Trade Center on September 11, a second generation Arab-American family \nbuilding a community based on Islamic principles, a Congressional Chief of Staff working for justice, and a refugee fleeing religious persecution, whose experiences in some way echo Muhammad's life. \n\nWith some of the world's greatest scholars on Islam providing historical context and critical perspective, Muhammad: Legacy of a Prophet is history in the present tense. It tells of intrigue and faith, bitter persecution and the birth of a holy book, brutal war and brilliant diplomacy in a desert environment where tribal allegiance was often the only protection.\n\nSupported by two educational websites, www.pbs.org/muhammad and www.theislamproject.org, this is an excellent resource for people seeking knowledge about the beginnings of Islam, as well as a better understanding of the millions of American Muslims who regard Muhammad as the Last Prophet.\n\nInitial PBS Broadcast, Muhammad: \nLegacy of a Prophet\n\nOur initial project, a documentary on the life of Muhammad (pbuh),first aired on PBS on December 18, 2003. This prime-time, weeknight broadcast covered 97% of the United States. The two-hour program played without commercial interruption on 340 stations nationwide and was viewed simultaneously in Canada. \n\nPrior to broadcast, PBS designated our show a âPick of the Monthâ program and featured it on their community outreach website. \n\nPress coverage was extensive, with articles appearing in 40 newspapers nationwide. (See Reviews) The program was discussed nationally on MS-NBC and received a great deal of radio coverage, too. Â In many cases, print, TV, and radio coverage outlined the story of \nMuhammad (PBUH) as part of their review, so that the actual exposure to Muhammadâs story far exceeded the PBS audience. Â MS-NBC ran clips of the show nationally, one day prior to the broadcast.\n\nAn above average audience of six million viewers watched the program. Viewers\nresponded enthusiastically. In the last two weeks of December, the filmâs PBS-supported website received a total of 630,000 page views by approximately 373,000 usersâ extremely heavy traffic \nfor a PBS program website.\n\nIn addition, PBSâs central offices in Washington DC received 5,000 messages in the first two days of broadcasting (See Viewers Views). Â On average, these responses ran 40 to 1 positive. The programâs associated websites received thousands more messages. Â Through the winter of 2003, the video and DVD versions of Muhammad: Legacy of a Prophet were the two top-selling items \nfor PBS.	Society & Culture
Why is society so ready to believe racial sterotypes? . I am black and i grew up in a farming community of 20 people.\nI don't know fit any of the sterotypes about blacks.\n\nYet I get sterotyped daily and blamed for crimes, harrassed by officers and arrested for crimes that are so far fetched that I can't believe it.\n\nWhy is society so ready to believe racial sterotypes? . People belive stereotypes because it is so much easier to form an opionon from what someone told you than to get to know each individual. It's like reading a book. It's so much easier for someone to tell you about a book than to read it yourself. But if you took the time to read it, you would be able to learn a lot more and develop your own ideas about the book. It might take longer but you might find out that it's a really good book.

Why do people want to commit suicide (kill themselves)? Isn't it a bad and sad thing? . There was a particular question that I viewed, and I think it had 34 responses or so. The person asked if he sould attempt suicide. Some encouraged him not to - and the majority of the rest encouraged him to go ahead and kill himself with the knife. From the posting of that question - its a sad and scary posibility that he might have killed himself, and, based on belief, gone to... you kno. Why do people want to kill themselves? Is it worth it? Whats the consequences? How would you encourage someone who is going through their chronicles of misery and pain, wanting to exit the earth without due time? All answers welcome. And people, for those out their, this is a question of concern. No profanity. Thanks. . The problem with most of society is that they do not realize that suicide is not away of getting attention. When a person talks about suicide I can guarantee that they will eventualy try and will often times succeed. Suicides are always done in private and when it is time, love ones never know untill it is to late.\n\nPeople commit suicide because of the incredible emotional and sometimes physical pains that they experience.\n\nSome say that our Gothic and emo children are sad and depressed and talk about suicide because they wan attention, but many do not realize that severe depression affects many different kinds of people. I affects all races, all sexuses, all ages, it affects the very wealthy as well as the very poor.\n\nMany people who do not understand depression are quick to insult and put down those of us that are truly sad. Depression is an illness of the brain that affects the seritonin levels within the brain. These people do not want to be this way but the brain has the inability to make the chemicles in the brain needed to control their emotions.\n\nI live in Orange County Ca (like the tv show), I have an SUV and a sports car, I have a beautiful wife and daughter, and live a very good life. I say all this because I suffer from depression in a horrible way and have attempted suicide 3 times nearly succeeding on the third attempt. Just like a diabetic I am required to take medicines and I have therapy very often to insure I stay alive.\n\nPeople who talk about suicide need to be taken very seriously even if they talk about it all the time. These people do not understand why they feel this way and know that this is not a normal thing to feel.\n\nThese people are often blown off because a societies ignorance to this problem. It has been very difficult for my family, especially my wife. She thaught as did my friends that I was just being weird untill I was put in the hospital. My family did some research and now understand this condition.\n\nJust one more thing, a person who attempts and/or succeds suicide is not weak or unbrave at all. I say this because any person not afflicted with depression have a fear of death. I do not fear death and for me attempting suicide or even thinking about it, is as easy as washing my hands.\n\nDon't cast these people aside, take them very seriously, you may save a life.

what is the best way to evict a tenant for not paying? In Tennessee? .  . Good Luck, I know you are going through Hell with this. I don't know why people think us Landlords run a half way house.  They can't understand why we need the rent. They think we are rich. I lost a house because someone didn't pay rent one time, that they think that they don't get off easy.  \n\nBest advice I can give, because I don't live in Tennessee is be very careful with choosing a new tenant.  Take your time, it is cheaper to leave the place clean and vacant then to kick some out because you wanted to rent it soon. Do a throw background check even if it cost you more money then you get in the application, it will save you more money in the long run.\n\nGood Luck, I feel for you.	Business & Finance
"If meeting the Devil was the only way too know if God truly exsists, would you? . How many of you think you could? . No - because belief in God is different from proving His existence - Faith allows and encourages belief in the creator without physically dragging God into a room and shouting - Here He is!.\n\nAs a christian, we believe we face evil everyday. It is either natural evil (Natural catastrophes) or evil inflicted on others by man.\n\nEvil exists - we can clearly see it, however this does not necessarily make it necessary to ""believe"" that there is an entity called ""the devil"" - however it's easier to believe that he exists than it is to believe that God exists.\n\nChristians believe that God is the Creator -look what he created - this wonderful and beautiful planet, He is the Saviour(and I use this not in the evangelical sense as I am a Catholic - and don't believe that God the Father willed his son to die in an atoning sacrifice.  I don't believe that his blood ""had"" to be shed for people's redemption - however it was a fact that it did take place - and it allowed the Christian community to accept the validity of Christs death on the cross.\n\nJesus preached forgiveness which was unconditional - the same applies with redemption -I dont believe that God the Father ""willed"" this to be the way of salvation.  God, being God could have chose another way.  If the forgivness of Jesus was limited to ""asking for our own forgivness on the condition that we do the same too - then the same would apply to God the Father as the son of God is equally God in our own human state. \n\nMy rant is now over - I hope that this throws a wee bit more light on what your looking for."

why do they do that ? . i have a friend that  cuts herself and she told me that she has over 120 scars.. anyone have a idea why someone would do that to themselfs ? . sometimes its for the attention, maybe she is not getting enough attention at home and feels that this way someone will pay attention to her if she continues to hurt herself. She might also have some repressed memories of past abuse, and that might be the only way she feels it gets rid of the *dirtiness*.Or it could also be the fact that she feels that to cut herself it will let the pain bleed out, and that everything will come out with the blood. And that the scars are a  reminder of all the pain she has endured. Its all really bad, and you should tell her to seek a counselors advice before she slits her wrist and commits suicide. Or if she wont get help, speaking up can also be one of the best things a friend can do, even if she does get mad at you, its the best interest of her self.	Health

Fiance still talks with ex.  This bothers me... am I just paranoid? . We've been together for three years now.  She dated this guy for a little while when she was maybe 16 (six years ago).  They keep in touch sporadically, and just recently got together for dinner.   Nothing happened, and I don't expect it ever would.  I trust my fiance completely, so it's not me thinking she's going to cheat on me with him.  It's just kind of uncomfortable for me... I guess it feels like she's taking time that she could spend with me and giving it to him.  I don't go running around with other girls, and expect that I should be the only guy in her life.  So, I guess the question (questions, heh) comes down to:\n\n1) Am I being overly paranoid/protective?\n2) It's not mistrust, and I can't put a finger on what it is.  Any insights?\n3) How do I deal? (no card jokes, please)\n4) Is it normal to keep in contact with exes?  I'm of the mindset where one should make a clean break and disassociate completely.\n\nI guess that's it... thanks for reading!  That's all 1000 chars!!! . 1) Not at all.\n\n2) Instinct.  No males in the animal kingdom will let any other male to associate with his female.  What, you're not an animal?\nOkay, so we're a little more evolved than that.  But considering that you feel deprived of her attention and time, it's a valid reason to feel slighted.   \n\n3) Tell her only about how her speaking with her ex makes you feel.  Don't say anything about how wrong she is or what a dork her ex is, and etc.  She must know how you feel inside without you or her getting defensive or judgemental.  Your feelings should not be a secret to come between you two.  You're seething and at the same time, feeling guilty for not being a man enough to tolerate her male acquaintance.  This is not a \npositive feeling to harbor alone.  Once you communicate how you feel about her talking to her ex, she will understand how valid and right you are and should stop doing what makes you ill at ease.  \n\n4) Disassociate away!  I completely agree with you.  Personally, I tear up all my ex's pictures and leave no trace of them lying about, a courtesy to my husband to spare him of thoughts you are experiencing.

Why would anyone think that taking guns away from lawful citizens would lower crime rates? .  . Because crime rates are incredibly lower in countries with stricter gun control, especially violent crime.\n\nEdit: In the UK they had a violent crime rate in 2004-5 of 224 crimes per 10,000.

Thoughts on this article (immigration)? . From an on-line article from KTRK-Channel 13 (Houston)\n\n\n\nFirst in Texas\nA suburb of Dallas could soon be the first city in Texas to adopt an ordinance to keep illegal immigrants out. The city council in Farmers Branch will consider the proposal Monday. It includes banning landlords from leasing to illegal immigrants, penalizing businesses that employ undocumented workers, and making English the city's official language. Other towns across the country have adopted similar ordinances, including more than a dozen in Pennsylvania and some in California. \n(Copyright Â© 2006, KTRK-TV) .

In tennis, my opponent keeps hitting slow, high, moon balls back.  What should I do to win? . I never have the patience to play out the point, I just try to end the point in a hurry. . I feel your pain.  I also have a lack of patience and sometimes struggle with moonballers.  There are many good suggestions here.  Here are mine.\n\n1.  Use the multiple moon balls to see if you can find a weakness.  Hit to the forehand and backhand, see if your moon baller does not like a shot.  Hit drop shots, see if he can play the net.  Hit to the corners and down the middle.  Hit even right at his feet. See if you can find a tendency to take advantage of it.   I would even position yourself on the court to force obvious shot.  I once played a moonballer who could not hit a backhand well down the line.  I would hit to his back hand and then postion my self in the ad-cout to force him to hit it there.  You are going to see a lot of shots, might as well learn what the guy can do.  \n\n2.  If you can, serve and volley.  Most moonballer do not hit real sharp returns.  It is difficult to hit a decent lob off a good serve.  Don't just limit it to first serves, I would also come in on 25-50% of second serves.  See if this pressure thwarts his passive game. \n\n3.  Make sure you are in shape.  You are probably going to be out there a while.  Have water, even a snack for the third set. \n\n4.  I hate to break this to you, but you will never be a really good singles player until you develop patience.  Take it from someone who learned the hard way.  I am a much better doubles player, because I can go for the kill very often.  Singles you have accept a 75% shot most of the time.  Forcing the issue usually results in disaster.  \n\nHope this helps.	Sports
Solve the systems of equations for:  3x-2y=5;           -6x+4y=7? . I just can't seem to get this one. The first one to get it gets the best answer. . Given 3x - 2y = 5, if you follow the suggestion in the first answer and multiply it by 2 you get\n\n6x - 4y = 10\n\nand if you add this and the second equation you get\n\n0x + 0y = 17 or 0 = 17, indicating that there is no solution to this simultaneous pair.  Why, you might ask - if you solve each equation for y you get\n\ny = 3x/2 - 5/2  and\ny = 6x/4 + 7/4\n\nThe coefficient of x in the second equation reduces to 3/2, so these equations have the same slope and are therefore parallel.

UNESCO stands for United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization.\n\nIt s a specialized agency of the United Nations established in 1945. Its stated purpose is to contribute to peace and security by promoting international collaboration through education, science, and culture in order to further universal respect for justice, the rule of law, and the human rights and fundamental freedoms proclaimed in the UN Charter.[1]\n\nIn total, 191 nations belong to UNESCO. The organization is based in Paris, with over 50 field offices and several institutes and offices throughout the world. Most of the field offices are ""cluster"" offices covering three or more countries; there are also national and regional offices. UNESCO pursues its action through five major programmes: education, natural sciences, social and human sciences, culture, and communication and information. Projects sponsored by UNESCO include literacy, technical, and teacher-training programmes; international science programmes; the promotion of independent media and freedom of the press; regional and cultural history projects, the promotion of cultural diversity; international cooperation agreements to secure the world cultural and natural heritage and to preserve human rights; and attempts to bridge the world-wide digital divide.\n\nYou could get more information from the link below..."

You're more interested in it, crime's not going anywhere (so there will always be SOMETHING), and that field seems to serve a more benevolent purpose.\n\nIf you aren't really satisfied with the results of the test you took, then I'd also suggest you ignore it, and sit down to think about what you love doing in life and how you can turn that into a career.  It doesn't sound like good advice at first, but don't play it safe and end up with a dull career that leaves you unfulfilled-- do what you love, whatever the potential risks.	Education & Reference

They get enriched by the spam sent to their own customers!\n\nSince they get a cut, a ""piece of the action"", they do not have the strongest incentive to get rid of spam anymore.\n\nLobbiests helped write this law.

It gives them no recourse and no compensation.\n\nThe US Congress's CAN-SPAM also had the effect of revoking state laws against spam that actually had some teeth in them.\n\nA very recent study found that the amount of email spam that was actually complying with the CAN-SPAM guidelines for identifying adult email and letting users actually ""opt-out"" of receiving it was at something like 0.27%, down from 0.3%.\n\nIn other words, practically none complies and obviously no one is stopping the over 99.7% of illegally spam.\n\nAt the time the bill was becoming law, it was thought that the term ""can"" meant get rid of or cancel.  Now, it seems more that the term ""can"" as in ""package for mass distribution"" is more fitting and perhaps what the drafters/sponsors of the bill meant.\n\nI wish there was a better word than ""Spam"" to describe this abhorrent practice.\n\nI hardly feel like ""devouring"" all these unsoclicited marketing messages I get by phone and email.\n\nPlus, if I start receiving any on my cell phone - and thus have to pay to listen to them - I am really going to get steamed at these guys!\n\nI have included links to:  the maker's website, the official and unofficial spam sites, the Wikipedia pages about electronic spam and about the highly inneffective CAN-SPAM law that the US Congress passed.\n\nHopefully, the next Congress will replace this disingenuous law with one that helps The People, and not select commercial interest, and actually stops spammers from spamming, which is what was claimed CAN-SPAM would do.\n\nFor that to actually happen, depends upon how you vote\n\nA Congress in the pocket of big, commercial interest lobbiests is not going to want to stop you from receiving barrages of unwanted commercial email and adware.  Not if there is money to be made by doing it, which there is.\n\nThere you have it.  That is what spam is, why it is, where the term comes from, what you can do about it, and why you get so much of it every day in your email box."	Computers & Internet

For NYS: A plow plowing snow off an overpass drops snow to the road below that slams into a car...? . If a snow plow is clearing snow off an overpass with an expressway below with speed limit of 65, and pushes over and drops a huge chunk of densly packed snow over the 3 foot concrete barrier along the edge of the overpass that lands on the windshield of a car below that's traveling at least 65 almost causing a fatal accident, but does cause slight damage to the car, is there any liability on anyone's part to protect the motorists from below as for bridge construction or extra barriers - either on part of the town or county (the oevrpass was a county road with speed limit of 55)? The amount of snow that came over was pretty much close to the threshold of causing the windshield to cave in. The driver maintained control and pulled over a mile down and waited for a trooper to submit an accident report. Overall damage: approx $500. It was said by the trooper that the plow and / or operator was not liable. . I don't understand what you said about the damage. You say that it almost caused a fatal accident, but did cause slight windshield damage. That doesn't sound like a truthful statement. \n\nMost plow operations have rules that exempt them from certain rules of the road and some liability. That would be something a lawyer would have to decide, which could get expensive.\n\nIf all you have in damage is $500, it probably wouldn't be worth it to hire a lawyer and sue.

"When investing in realestate, is it best to buy and sell, or buy and rent? .  . It all depends on what is happening in your market. Some markets are ""cashflow"" markets. These are areas where you can buy a house and rent it out for an amount where you make a good profit, thus cashflow.\n\nOther markets are better for buy and sell. When you can't make properties cashflow, then you need to find properties where you can buy low and sell high. Also, there are times when you are willing to have a negative cashflow because the appreciation is so high. You hold the property for a few years, renting it and feeding it at the same time, and then sell when the appreciation has increased the value and you get your payday then.\n\nThe market determines the strategy -- not the other way around."

It was her idea to have her friend live here. She always asks me if I want to screw her and doesn't like me talking to any of my friends that are gurls. I tell her that if she can't trust me what is the point of being together. She gets jelous and suspicious when nothings going on. All I do is go to work and come home, every day. and stay home all day with her on the weekends. I'm leaving for the Army in a couple weeks and she's scared that I am going to meet a girl there.

Even though she plays the dumb chick, her skills are up to par. (Besides, she was kickin' @$$ through out the tournament!)\n\nAnd I agree wit u. I don't believe she deserved that beating from Umaga.

ok ( please no stupid answers this is a school homework question)? . the earth is rotating at the equator at 1,000 miles/hour. If a helicopter lifts off at the equator and hovers for 24 hours, will the earth spin beneath it? ( this is not a trick question it is either a yes or no answer ) . Good question! I think no because everything moves within the atmosphere. Such as 8 hour long airplanes. If they travel the opposite direction of the earth's rotation, it wouldn't just stay still over the same exact spot over the ocean if it traveled 1000mph. good question, but that's what i predict using prior knowledge. Plus, i think it's gravitational force that makes every object move at the same time along with the earth itself. It may have to do with Earth's magnetic field, i don't know.	Science & Mathematics

How do you feel about interleague play?  Excitement? Novelty? or does it cheapen the World Series? .  . I like it but I think they need to make changes.  First off, they need to transfer one NL team to the AL to balance out leagues.  Then they need to do what NFL does with interconference, rotate matchups so that you play each division once every three years.  And eliminate geographical matchups so every team in a division is playing the same interleague slate.  It's not fair if the Marlins and Mets are battling for playoffs that Marlins play six games against Devil Rays every year and Mets have to play six games against Yankees each year.	Sports

"What are the symptoms and causes for lumber sciatica syndrome and what are its do""s and dont's? .  . wow 2 good answers and one stupid one.  I'm not sure what the first guy meant when he brought up the uncommon pyriformis syndrome, but I can vouch as a doc and a patient that occasionally, after the sciatica goes away, you get weird leg pains which are actually muscle cramps due to being out of shape.  These can be muscles you don't usually think about or worry about, like the pyriformis muscle.  \n\nMost herniated discs heal on their own without treatment.  It's no surprise ppl make claims that they took zero medications and they're fine.  However, inflamation is not always the best thing for the body to do (example: seasonal allergies are inflammation to innocuous things like dust!), and so anti-inflammatories are appropriate for something like a herniated disc.  Also, if they can reduce a little bit of the pain so you can get up and be active, so much the better.\n\nDo's and Don'ts...  Physical therapists are experts in this regard.  They help get you out of bed and back to activity.  They teach you positions to avoid and how to lift, sit, sleep, get up, etc.  It really depends what is the cause of your sciatica though.\n\nFor herniated discs, you want to take the stress away from your discs.  Proper lifting technique (or avoid lifting).  Strong abdominal muscles to take the load off the disc.  Be careful when jumping, crouching, kneeling, tiptoeing.  Spine extension exercises.  Avoid spinal flexion.  Stay active so that all your muscles help to unload the disc"	Health
Why most christianity don't questions them self about Christmas? and why is Dec 25? . Why most christianity don't questions them self about Christmas? and why is Dec 25?

She is acting like that because she is confused, trying to find the balance between the truth that God did it for her, and that she had to be willing to take the action to let Him.\n\nSounds like this is rather new to her, and she wants to ackowledge God in her life, but also needs the support for having accomplished such a great feat.  Stopping smoking is harder than quiting a crack habit.  She deserves compliments, but is afraid to take them less she borget about God's hand in it.\n\nWho understands women?

what site do i go on to create my own website? . like if i wanted to create my own website where do i go? . There are lots of great tools out there that are helpful, including sites that offer templates and help you get started. I have been impressed with the tools and service of GoDaddy (www.godaddy.com). If you'd like to learn more about the process, consider buying this book, which outlines the process, step-by-step: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0764507206/103-8389304-7234204?v=glance&n=283155\n\nHere's some tips from http://website-design.mcdar.net/:\n\nSo you want to build a website here I will explain some simple but also key aspects that are commonly taken in to consideration when a website developer creates a website.\n\n1) Website Design - The website design must be neat meaning that everything looks like where it is meant to be (nothing out of place or out of proportion). Also your sites design is related to the topic of your website e.g. your site is about flowers then your design must have flowers.\n\n2) Site Navigation - Visitors must be able to get where they want to go without going through a maze a good way of putting it if you can get there in 3 clicks it should be fine. Also it helps when search engine spiders go through your site since it makes it easy for the spiders to index the site.\n\n3) Domain Name - Domain name is important since it is one of the first thing that your visitors will see. Your domain should relate to your site topic or business name. Length of the domain usually 6-8 characters is a good length and easy for visitors to type.\n\n4) Scroll Bars - don't make your website pages too long so your visitors have to scroll for hours it is also a good option to just create another page and don't make people scroll side to side.\n5) Returning Visitors - make your visitors return to your site by adding one or all to your site:\n\n- Email Newsletter (Ezine)\n- Community Forums\n- Online Tools\n- Online Games\n- Useful Content\n- Competitions and Prizes\n- and so on\n\n5) Website Logo - Make your logo unique and brandable so that people will remember your logo and then will remember your site and products.\n\nThese are some simple points that you may take into consideration when you build your website if you need some further assistance have a look at your competitors website and see what they have done. Remember what you put in is what you get out of your website and on that note GOOD LUCK and enjoy the whole process of building your very own virtual property.\n\n\nAll that said, if you'd like something simple and quick, here's the company that made my website, and they charged me less than $300. I knew nothing about doing it, but it came out great and they guided me every step of the way: www.wordtechs.com.\n\n\nGood luck with your new venture!\n~Tia~	Computers & Internet

If you just want to be a volunteer,  the answer is NO... except... most all states require that you take a basic firefighting class that, state to state, could be as little as 38 hours and as much as 120 that I have seen.  However, if you are looking to go full time,  the hours usually jump up to 240 hours of firefighting along with 120 hours of basic EMS training at minimum.  Now, if you are full time,  and you have completed these classes, then you should absolutely consider taking college courses as they may be required as you move up in the ranks.

Can a relationship make it to marriage  when his daughter has issues with his girlfriend? . We have been together for over 8 yrs. Taking the next step was well over due.Her father and I have had our problems like all do. Last year I broke it off because the relationship was not moving forward. We respect and love each other but the writing was on the wall we wanted different things for our life. Surprisingly he asked me to marry him.\n I thought his daughter and I had a good friendship,no problems. She has always lived in another town, he sees her often, paid for college, all living expence he is a great father. She was married a few months ago to a good man. She is happy, so why does'nt she want her father to be happy as well. This has shocked and hurt me beyond words. \nLooking back I had only visited a few time and have not spent a great deal with her. Her father is talking to her about it. He is upset and in the middle of this. \nI love him but, I have my own issues now. This has come between us and I don't know how to handle it. Can it still work? I almost want to walk. . She is a daddy's girl, spoiled rotten, and wants to control her father, no one will never be good enough for her dad. Yes you can have a successful marriage with this man. But he has got to be a man, he does not have to let her control, who he sees, wants, or be with.

"Is it normal to be angry with your therapist if you don't feel you're getting better? . I feel like since I started therapy and going to a psychiatrist (about 6 months ago) I've become much more depressed and anxious.  I want them to make me better not worse! . Actually, you have to look at something else first.\nPeople don't go to a therapist to feel better unless they didn't do their homework on what going to therapy is like. Peopel expect to leave therapy feeling better.\nTherapy is designed to help you see your self-image better.  Here's the problem:\n1) We all have multiple self-images.\n2) Some of them are false.\n3) Some of us are VERY attached to our self-images.\n4) Looking at them makes it hard to keep up false self-images.\n5) People who make us look at them are a threat to our self-images.\n6) Since we rarely differentiate (try to keep seperate) real threats to our safety vs. threats to our self-image we often react with fear, then anger, then attack to challenges to our self-image.\n7) This leaves us stuck with a faulty self-image because we confused reality knocking on our door with an actual threat to our survival.\n\nIf you are resisting therapy, yes, you are angry.  The only way to know for sure is to look deeply at why you are angry, and discuss this with, you guessed it, your therapist.  At the same time, if you don't trust your therapist, in most cases you can choose a new one, but it will only prolong your pain to keep avoiding the real reason, whatever it is, if you are resisting therapy.\nHiding things, including your dissatisfaction, will not help.  Tell them.  If you are a minor, tell your parents everything you can (they are legally and financially responsible for you).\nRemember, if you are angry, that means you're scared of something and seeing a threat.  IF the threat is ""just"" lack of progress, then change therapists.  If the threat is something else, like getting too close to the truth, you've got a GOOD therapist, and need to face it like an adult.  We never stop growing if we're smart.  I've only known one real fully adult person in my life and I'm 43!  Trust yourself to know when you're squirming away from the truth, and when you're standing still.  Ask your therapist to be more aggressive in finding the problem.  If this causes you to squirm, you know what the problem is.  You don't want them looking too close, so stick with it and look."

"What happens when two black holes get too close? .  . If two bodies (stars, black holes, anything) get close enough to be gravitationally bound they will develop some sort of orbit in which the two bodies circle each other. \n\n\nEinstein's theory of General Relativity predicts that when two very massive objects(like Black Holes and Neutron Stars) are caught in an orbit like this they will generate Gravitational Waves (Ripples in Space-Time). These Gravitational Waves carry energy away from the orbiting bodies which means that with each successive revolution they get closer to each other. Eventually the orbit gets so small that the two bodies merge. \n\n\nThe merger of two black holes entails a lot of complicated General Relativity and some non-intuitive physics, but theorists use large supercomputers to simulate such events. There are two primary results to these mergers of which we can be sure of: \n\n1. A single, more massive black hole \n\n2. An extremely powerful burst of gravitational waves \n\n\nThere are currently projects like LIGO which will attempt to directly detect the disturbances in space time caused by gravitational waves. They primarily expect to ""see"" the results of neutron star and black hole binary mergers. \n\n\nThere was also a recent discovery of a black hole merger in a distant galaxy though this was discovered by observing the jet streams caused by the black holes. You should note that those results are still preliminary and unconfirmed."	Science & Mathematics

what is a Supplemental Compensatory Selection in the NFL draft? .  . A free agent is a player whose contract has expired and is eligible to sign with another team. A restricted free agent is a player for whom another team can make an offer, but his current team is allowed to match that offer. If the current team chooses not to match the offer, it may receive compensation in the form of a draft choice. The NFL awards compensatory picks based on the net loss of restricted free agents. The limit for compensatory picks is four per team. \n\nThe supplemental draft is held after the draft and its more like a auction teams bid for players using the following year's draft pick. if you believe a player is 1st round material in the supplemental draft you bid your 1st rd pick from next year and if you win the player you lose the spot you picked that player at for the following year's draft. The NY Giants did this years ago with Dave Brown. They used a 1st Rd pick in the Supplemental Draft to select hom and did not have a 1st RD pick in the regular draft the following season.	Sports

"how much of hte encoding into electical signals does the retina do? . if it's only job is to relay light signals to the optic nerve,then wiring the image straight ot the optic nerve would do the job and why is this not available? . The photoreceptor cells in the deepest (surprisingly!) layer of the retina encode the light image into electrical signals.  There is NO form of fibre optic light pipe.  The signal is purely electrical, not light, from the first cell in the system onwards.\n(When I say purely electrical, I mean not light, ie electrical and chemical neurotranmitter/receptor, of course.)\n\nNeural synapses occur through a sequence of several cells before the pattern of neural impulses reaches the optic nerve. Oddly, the light has to pass through these neurons in order to reach the photoreceptors.\n\nI understand these synapses are arranged so as to identify and encode contrasting edges and lines, providing initial processing of the image within the eye. \n\nI claim no more than the most elementary knowledge, so hopefully further answers will detail what processing exactly is performed before the optic nerve takes the messages to the temporal cortex and tectum.\n\nPerhaps more chance of this if not under ""Engineering""."

Who knighted the late Botswana President Sir Seretse Khama and why? .  . Khama, Sir Seretse, in seTswana: SerÃªtsÃª a Sekgoma a Kgama (b. July 1, 1921, Serowe, Bechuanaland [now Botswana] - d. July 13, 1980, Gaborone, Botswana), president of Botswana (1966-80). He was the son of Sekgoma II and grandson of Kgama III the Good, who had allied his kingdom in Bechuanaland with British colonizers in the late 19th century. Seretse Khama inherited the chieftainship of the baNgwato (or Bamangwato) people when he was four years old, on the death of his father. While his uncle Tshekedi was foster-father and regent, Seretse Khama was educated in South Africa and then at Oxford. While studying law there, he met his future wife, Ruth Williams; their mixed marriage in 1948 caused considerable controversy both in Bechuanaland, where the tribal chiefs opposed it, and in Britain, where the government tried to block the marriage. At home Khama won popular support, but the British government forced his exile from Bechuanaland until he agreed to renounce the chieftainship in 1956. Returning to Bechuanaland as a private citizen, he retrieved as a political leader what he had lost as a hereditary ruler. In 1962 he founded the moderate multiracial Democratic Party, which swept the polls in the country's first elections in 1965, and he became prime minister. He helped negotiate the terms of Botswana's independence, and received a knighthood in 1966. On independence he assumed the title of president for a term of three years, which was subsequently renewed on several occasions, and he served until his death. He promoted his ideal of a multiracial democracy, achieved free universal education in Botswana, and sought to diversify and strengthen the country's economy. He generally avoided actions which were likely to provoke South African hostility.	Politics & Government

Not more than a few hundred cases have been described worldwide.\n\nIt was first described by Gascoyen in 1860.

"What happens when the queen ant dies.? . I seen an ant once and it had wings and it was huge and all the other ants were crawling all over it. So I KNOW it was the queen. How did this ant get wings? And when the queen dies how does a new ant get wings and grow all big? There can only be one queen, seen it on TV. . All female ants have wings when they hatch. After they hatch, they take a maiden flight where they are met with swarms of male ants. She mates many times, then seeks out a nesting place to make a colony, breaks off her wings, and tunnels underground to start her colony. This is how you tell mated females from unmated females: the unmated females still have their wings.\n\nWhen an ant colony loses their queen, they will sometimes split into two or more colonies. It is not known how or why they select a particular larva, but the drones all begin feeding a single larva a special diet (NOT royal jelly - this is specific to bees, which are related to ants and have similar biology and behavior to ants). This special diet causes the larva to grow larger than others, and become a fully reproductive female (the other ""females"" in the colony are sterile - same as bees). Once this larva hatches, she mates, breaks off her wings, and becomes the new queen. \n\nIn many cases, several larvae will be fed the diet to become fully reproductive females, but only one will become queen of that colony, the others will go with the rest of the colony if it splits, or they will go on to form their own colony. As someone mentioned above, a queenless colony, on occasion, will meld with another colony that still has a queen. But as far as I understand, it is more common for the queenless colony to raise several new queens that will be dispersed where needed.\n\nThere is a lot of research going on right now with both bees and ants to figure out how this selection of a new quieen occurs and why it is so consistent. Also, how a queen (bee or ant) can mate during one flight in her entire life, yet produce viable eggs for some 20 years or so after...how does the male sperm stay viable within her for that long? This all has yet to be discovered.\n\nBees and ants are just the coolest insects and there's so much we have yet to discover about them!"	Science & Mathematics

The calculated Risk Priority Number(RPN) for each failure mode and a priority ranking. Actions required to reduce RPN's.A discussion of the benefits and limitations of the method in general and as applied to smoke alarm. . In order to perform a design FMEA, you need first to divide your global system (smoke alarme) in subsystem (captor, alarm, transistor, etc...).\nThen you need to find all the functionnalities of each system (ex: captor : detect smoke)\nThe Failure mode is then defined by the functionnality absent, partially functionning or giving a wrong indication ( smoke not detected, alarm on but no smoke, etc...)\nThe effect is what will happen to the end customer for the system or the upper system for the subsystem.\nOccurence is how often this can occur (usually use data from customer complaints or return or manufacture capabilities)\nYou then try to detect the causes, they must come from a subsystem malfuncting or noise factors.\nDetection is how do you prevent or detect this failure mode to happen.\nUse the same scale for severity, occurence and detection.\nCalculate RPN by multiplying the three.\nPut an action on Higher number.\nTry to do it with a group, this is the main advantage of a FMEA: give the team a consensus about the problems that can occur.\nThe group will have to find the solutions.

Sounds you have paid much attention to this Jordan, I trust that you will get along well with him. You asked how do you get him to notice you. Knowing that there are many possibilities, yet you need to understand what manner of mathods can present the 'Natural you'.\n\nBeing attractive means being your best self, you is the best thing that you can offer when getting someone's attention. Now these days people have a rather different view of attraction; wearing shorts or exposing some part of your body became common. In my personal opinion, these statics cannot form attraction. But a rather low and seducsive act.\n\nHow you apporch him, I can never know. I suggest that you can be a best friend to him. You may already spent time just to observe him, and that is good. If you allow yourself to be involve with him, that is even better. Spend time just listen to him (if he is talkative); try to understand him better each week; learn about his dreams, his fear and desires; be patient to your progress. And most important of all, be alert of his needs and try to be support. One more thing, try to focus on the good side of him.\n\nTo me, attraction is all about something that is really good, which is from deep inside one soul. It raidiates from one's true personality so that people can see it; hear it; feel it and even taste it.\n\nAll that I have mentioned, can lead to a closer relationship with someone if you do it sincerely.

why don't judges in La. rule by the law? . community property state. Local judge gives all assets to working spouse. Why? . First, remember that just because a state follows Community Property laws doesn't mean that all property is automatically CP. If the income derives solely from a separate property asset, it generally remains separate property. Each CP state has different rules for modifying this, but the basic premise remains.\n\nAlso remember that Louisiana is a civil law, rather than common law, jurisdiction. That means that each judge is free to interpret the statutory laws as they wish, and that prior judicial rulings do not have the same binding effect that they do in common law states. Thus, unless the legislative statute specifically determines what happens in a particular situation, the outcome is less certain than it would be in other states.\n\nThere are not enough facts to answer your question fully. If the working spouse owns the business, and owned the business before getting married, then the business may be considered a separate property asset, and thus any proceeds are separate property. Or the working spouse may be entitled to specific assets because of a pre-nup agreement. Or because of debt allocation. Or for dozen other reasons, all dependent on facts not listed.\n\nThe bottom line is that the judge probably is ruling according to what the law (the legislative statutes) say, but either the statutes don't cover this particular case, or the facts lead to a situation that may not make sense at first glance, because of the way the law is written. But if the judge isn't following the law, that's grounds for appeal.	Politics & Government

"Calculus question, test in the morning? . The net worth, f(t) of a company is growing at a rate of f'(t)=2000-12t^2 dollars per year. Where t is years since 1990. How does the net worth of the company change between 1990 and 2000? . First you need to intergrate the equation to get f(t) the net worth of the company (and not the rate of net worth).\n\nf(t) = 2000t - 12(t^3)/3 + c\nAt time 1990 t = 0 so f(0) = 0 + c\nAt time 2000 t = 10 so f(10) = 2000*10 - 12*1000/3 + c = 16,000 + c\nTherefore the change in net worth between 1990 and 2000 is \nf(10) - f(0) = 16000 + c - (0+ c) = 16,000\n\nNote the c is called the constant of intergration. You don't have enough information to calculate what the actual net worth of the company is at any point in time, hence you need to add a constant ""c"". However, as the question asks for the change in net worth the ""c"" gets cancelled.\n\nNote to integrate these kinds of polynomials you simply add one to the power of the variable (in this case t) and divide by the result, and add ""c"" to the end of the equation. \n\nSo f ' (t) = 2000 - 12t^2  or f ' (t) = 2000t^0 - 12t^2\n\nSo for each term add one to the power of t and divide by the result to intergrate the funcation.\n\nf(t) = (2000t^1)/1 - 12(t^3)/3 + c\n\nor\n\nf(t) = 2000t - 12(t^3)/3 + c\n\nI hope that helps explain it a little better."

I say get rid of him...if he cant show u the affection around his friends just cuz he wants to appear single then he doesnt love you...if he did he would want to show u off. hes using u.  he wants his cake and wants to eat it to...looking single to the world but behind closed doors hes taken.\nto me that sounds like a reciepe for cheating.  get rid of him and find a guy that cant wait to show u off. u deserve better	Family & Relationships
"Which career would make more $$$, an architect, a miscuse (massage therapy) or and interior designer??? . I need to know what y'all think would make the most $$$, so I know which one would be best to take up. I enjoy doing all of them, I'll just do whatever one makes the most $$$. . There is no guarantee that I job title will bring in a larger or smaller amount of money. In this case I would have to say the architect, but I am sure that there has been an architect somewhere that has made less than a miscuse, odd as that would be.\n\nArchitecture however, is not to be entered lightly. It is either a 5 or 6 year degree for a BArch or a MArch, followed by 3 years of office internship, and then NCARB ARE testing to become accredited (8 Seperate tests with a pass rate from 66% to 75% per test), and then the licensure process by a state board. After that, you are an architect. I would say that for the time involved and if you are in it mainly for money, pursue one of your other options. Even after all of that work there is no guarantee that you will ever even become prominent enough to get big deals, and in the meantime, you've built up a lot of school debt. \n\nSo enter Architecture cautiously if it is what you want to do, but know that the money will be delayed and may never live up to the ""Rich Architect"" stereotype.

"whats calld the caspian see in iran? .  . The Caspian Sea is a landlocked endorheic sea between Asia and Europe (European Russia). It is the world's largest inland body of water. It has a surface area of 371,000 kmÂ² (143,000 sq. mi.), and a maximum depth of about 980m (3200 ft). Thus it has characteristics common to both seas and lakes. It is often listed as the world's largest lake, though it is not a freshwater one. It has a salinity of approximately 1.2%, about a third the salinity of sea water.\n\nIn classical antiquity it was called the Hyrcanian Ocean. It has also been known as the Khazar Sea. In Persian antiquity, as well as in modern Iran, it is known as the Mazandaran Sea. Old Russian sources call it the Khvalyn (Khvalynian) Sea after the Khvalis, inhabitants of Khwarezmia. Ancient Arabic sources refer to Bahr-e-Qazvin â the Qazvin Sea. In fact, the word ""Qazvin"" is derived from Caspian."	Science & Mathematics

"How do you throw a boomerang away? .  . A right-handed boomerang circles towards the left, a left-handed boomerang circles towards the right. Most sport boomerangs are in the range of 2.5 to about 4 ounces. the range on most of these is between 25 - 40 yards (or meters) \nA right or left handed boomerang can be thrown with either hand, but the flight direction will depend upon the boomerang, not the thrower. \nGrasp one wing of the boomerang nearly vertically so that the other wing points forward and the flat side is away from you. The other way works also, but this way is usually easier to learn. Holding the tip by just the end between your thumb and one or two fingers, launch the boomerang forward quickly while trying more for spin than for very much force. \nThe boomerang should flatten out on its own and arc around, sometimes coming to rest a little in front of the thrower or behind the thrower, but ideally should hover in gently allowing the thrower to catch it as a sort of ""boomerang sandwich"" between the thrower's hands. \nOne should not throw a returning boomerang level, like a flying disc. The boomerang will turn in the direction of the top of its airfoils, so if that direction happens to be up rather than to the side it may fly high enough that the landing causes damage to the boomerang or whatever it lands on."

Consider .99 cents; it will generally bump up the total number of bids, but will also cost you less to list the auction!\n\nAs for when you start and end your auctions, you really have to consider your audience and research what time of day other folks are getting the best prices for their wares.

"Wind dies down at night? . It seems like often, not always, the wind dies down at night.  Is this true, and is there a meteorological explanation for the peaceful evenings?? . This is not a simple answer to explain in one or two sentences, so I will give it in two parts.  First, the basic reason:\n\nOvernight, the breezy conditions that was on the surface is lifted upwards.  This is because the surface becomes very stable with the loss of daytime heating.  The wind will blow above this layer of stable air until after sunrise when daytime heating will bring the winds back to the surface.\n\nNow the more detailed explaination.  In general, wind at night will decouple from the surface if...\n-there is no strong subsidence (sinking of air) like what you will find behind a strong upper level disturbance.\n-there is strong mixing (unstable airmass) in and ahead of a storms system\n-there is strong surface winds with upper level support. (winds blowing from the same direction through a deep layer above the surface)\n-near ridge or hill tops\n\n(Assuming no major weather changes are expected to occur overnight...)  During the night, with the loss of daytime heating, we lose two parameters that will keep the winds blowing near the surface.  The thermal gradient usually becomes weak and the surface cools.  A thin stable layer forms near the surface as heat rises to the top of this layer.  With time, this layer will thicken as warm air continues to leave the lower layer and replace by cooler air.  The top of this layer, you will find a temperature inversion.  This layer will seperate the higher winds that has lifted higher in the atmosphere and the very stable and near calm winds below.  Once the sun rises, the surface warms and starts to mix.  This will break the inversion and the winds will start to mix back down to the surface.  \n\nThis is also the reason why during the winter, sometimes you will find ground fog forming in a thin layer during the evening and then lifting to a low cloud or stratus right by sunrise; then ""burning"" off during the day."

Vertebral subluxation is a vague diagnosis perpetuated by the less than credible chiropractic ""profession"".\n\nCheck out the following links to learn the truth about subluxations.\n\nhttp://www.quackwatch.org/01QuackeryRelatedTopics/chirosub.html\nhttp://www.quackwatch.org/01QuackeryRelatedTopics/chiroasst.html\nhttp://www.acsh.org/healthissues/newsID.656/healthissue_detail.asp\nhttp://www.chirobase.org/01General/chirosham.html\n\nMany chiropractors claim that research justifies their form of practice but this is really not the case.  See the following;\n\nResearch Findings\n\nDuring the past few years, two reports about the treatment of low-back pain have placed chiropractic in a favorable light. One, issued by the RAND Corporation, concluded that spinal manipulation was appropriate for some cases of low-back pain. The other, produced by the Agency for Health Care Policy and Research (AHCPR), judged manipulation useful for controlling symptoms while awaiting the spontaneous recovery that occurs within a month in most patients with low-back problems.\nAlthough chiropractors have promoted these reports as endorsements of chiropractic, they are not. They merely support the use of manipulation in carefully selected patients. Only a few of the research studies on which their conclusions were based involved manipulation by chiropractors; most were done by medical doctors and physical therapists whose practices are not identical to those of chiropractors. Most chiropractors manipulate the vast majority of patients who walk through their door, some use techniques that have not been studied scientifically, and many urge all of their patients to undergo monthly or even weekly ""preventive maintenance"" visits throughout their life. In addition, many chiropractors emphasize a technique that is more vigorous (and therefore less safe) than the controlled manipulation used by other practitioners. The only places where ""chiropractic"" and ""chiropractors"" are mentioned in the body of the AHCPR report are in the passages about the make-up of the AHCPR expert panel."	Health

how do I measure a road bike frame? . I want to sell my bike on ebay and have been asked to measure the frame. What would be the easiest way . You do not measure a bike from the pedals to the top of the saddle. There are variations in crankarm length and saddle height that would provide a very inaccurate measurement of the bike with regards to sizing.\n\nSizing conventions vary from manufacturer to manufacturer, and is best measured in centimeters. The only bikes that are measured in inches these days are mountain bikes, and those crappy store bought road and mountain bikes.\n\nIn the old days, a company would stamp the size of the bike on the bottom of the bottom bracket shell, or other inconspicuous location on the bike frame.\n\nNowadays, most manufacturers adhere to a standard of measuring from the center of the bottom bracket (running along the seat tube of the frame) to the center of the top tube.\n\nBut now with the advent of the compact frame and semisloping frame, it can get a bit more confusing. There's virtual length, and actual length.\n\nBest bet is to check your bike manufacturer's site.\n\nFor example:\nhttp://veloeuropa.com/product_nerv_specs.shtml	Sports

True Love, however, is more a matter of circumstance and mutual personal attachment that can only be discovered after you truly get to know them.  To complete another person and have them complete you, it is a true feeling because I have felt it.  True love that I felt with a passion that made me bear through every horrible thing in life and pound my chest in triumph, because I knew that if I lost my job, or a friend died, or I got in a horrible wreck, the love that we felt would keep me afloat.  Sadly, nothing gold can stay, but if you want a clear cut definition of true love, I can attempt it.  True love is notion that two intimate partners can find everything that they lack in their partner, to complete them as a whole, which may give inspiration to do things otherwise improbable, impossible, and when facing great adversity.  True love is worth fighting for.  I hope you find it.	Family & Relationships
What is the function or formula for producing prime numbers? .  . There isn't one. Mathematicians are working on it, but they have yet to find a pattern that covers all prime numbers (except for the fact they are divisible only by themselves and one.) There are patterns that cover some prime numbers, such as paired primes (where the difference between the two prime numbers is 2, such as 5 and 7), but there is no currently known way to quickly produce or check primes, which has important implications for the RSA algorithm (used in PGP for example), which relies on the complexity of primes for its security.

First of all, yes, America is trying to play the global policeman and the world is getting tired of it.  Yes, America has spread capitalism...not democracy...throughout the world which has left a good portion (about 6/10 of the world impoverished).  Yes, our politicians know they are doing this and continue to pass legislation to keep this stuff going.  That is the honest truth.  I've been trying to disprove this all through college and it hasn't happened yet.  America is not bad or evil...it just has made a fair number of mistakes...just like any other country.  America, however, at least in my opinion, can rise above this way of life and become a new kind of power.  America, in reality is an empire kind of like Rome.  America is at a fork in the road.  It can either go down the path of militarism and bleed itself dead like Rome did or it can become the global statesman and can bring about an era of peace.  It's all up to America.

"I need to be more flexible: more muscle or less? . I'm a martial artist and need to get more flexible, I'd like to be able to stretch further and get my kicks to go higher. I used to lift weights a lot and feel stiff as a refrigerator. Should I lose muscle to gain flexibility? is that a proper order of factors? Should I concentrate only on cardio workouts and no more weight training? . Okay - I am a fitness expert and muscle mass does NOT decrease flexibility until the mass is excessive (I'm talking biceps so big they physically stop the arm from bending because the forearm contacts the muscle belly).  \n\nHere are some important points on flexibility and big guys being ""muscle bound"" just because of their size is a myth.\nStretch - 5-7 days per week, 1 stretch per major muscle, 2-3sets per stretch, hold each stretch 30-40seconds.  There should be no pain, tingling, twitching or numbness during the stretch, just a light pulling sensation (if you stretch too far a reflex in the muscle is activated and the muscle actually reflexively tightens more - so it is counter-productive).\nMake sure all weight lifting is through the entire range of motion for that joint.  For example, the bicep curl should start with the arm pretty much straight and end with the palm just in front of the shoulder.\nStretch AFTER your workout.  Warm muscles are much more flexible and pliable.  If you aren't working out that day at least do 5-10 minutes of some type of cardio warm-up before you stretch.\nGood luck with it - Don't Skip Your Stretches!  It's tempting, but flexibility is just as important as the other components of fitness."	Health

How are basketball and volleyball similar? How are they different? . I'm doing a comparative essay and I need some ideas. If you can come up with some, thank you so much! . Both are played on a court with a ball, a net, and 5 players. In both if you  send the ball out of bounds the ball is given to the other team. In basketball the idea is to put the ball in the net while in volleyball, it has to go over the net. in basketball the players can roam the entire court, but in volleyball they have to stay on their own side. In volleyball you serve the ball to the other team while in Basketball you pass the ball to your teamate. In volleyball the other team serves the ball to you, in Basketball you have to steal it from the other team. In Baketball you play a timed games, but in volleyball the games are regulated by the points scored. And the match isn't over until the first team wins two games. In basketball the team with the most points at the end of the final period wins, in volleyball the first team to 15 and leading by two points wins.	Sports

Currently I am playing it for the 3rd time and not doing too bad, but if you want to play it, then you better wait until this session is over with because coming in in the middle of the season isn't a very good strategy. What happens is you have $30 million dollars to buy certain superstars every week and there is a points system for everything the wrestlers do like finishers, weapon shots, wins, appearances, etc. Now it's even harder because there are more superstars than ever before with the new ECW brand. Superstars cost anywhere from $500,000 to $5,000,000 which is why it can be very difficult to chose wisely. At the end of every week, though, you have an opportunity to buy or sell superstars for the next week. You should definitely try it and if you'd like then you can go ahead and start right now for some experience. They also give prizes away every week to the people with the most points for that week. At the end of the season, the team with the most points gets 2 tickets to a major PPV! There are a LOT of people that play this game now, but i'm proud to say that i'm ranked in the top 6,000 which is a great improvement from last season when I finished 38,000th!!!

Basically Wenger doesn't want to offer a 3-yr contract to Pires since as he's already 32, you don't know how much he will still be able to perform once he reaches 34. He has said he is willing to keep offering a years contract at the end of every season, based on how he has played that season. Though heart-wrenching, it makes a lot of sense!\n\nRight now Pires can play, but at his age, unfortunately, it's not difficult to imagine that 2 years later he just can't run as fast anymore, & doesn't have that kind of energy! That's the main reason for offering just a single year for a contract, but agreeing to give another year at the end of every season. If Pires trusts Wenger, he should sign it... just look at Bergkamp! He signed a single year extention some FIVE times!\n\nI don't think Pires is past his prime, but Wenger, as usual, is just being careful. I just hope Pires sticks around at Arsenal & doesn't go running to the first club to offer him a longer contract...	Sports

People get complacent and really don't know how to move forward in what they want out of life.\n\nReally, they don't KNOW what they want.  Therefore, can't go after ""it"".  They feel stuck.  If someone ""feels"" stuck, they ARE stuck.  They're receiving a pay check & getting they're bills paid (just or enough) and they're frozen there.  They're safe ""enough"".\n\nHabits are extremely difficult to change.  Getting up, going to your job everyday & receiving your pay check at the end of the week becomes routine.\n\nThen, when we hit that point where something just isn't sitting right with us (and not really knowing what it is), humans tend to complain about it (they ""think"" complaining is ""doing"") and intice others to join forces.  Since there are many that ""get stuck"" and don't know how or where to seek other options, the troops grow.\n\nAs the troops grow, the number of people complaining ""proves"" that the complaint is not only justified but out of ""their"" control.  It must be someone elses ""fault"" I am in this situation.\n\nThe blame game is very safe for many that don't know that the ""power"" of their growth is within themself ""Only""!  You are the only one that can get you Unstuck.\n\nAll human behavior or lack of it is ""fear"" based and fear can be very cripling for many.\n\nFor those who are enjoying the challanges and growth that life has to offer, the stuck ones can be very annoying!  But, it could also be you at some point in your life and Never say Never.  You just never know what tomorrow will bring.\n\nAlways, even when it's hard to do, have compasion for those who have less than you do.  Especially if it is emotional strength & direction."

If God is all-knowing, why did he create Satan? . God knows the future, present and past all as one time. God is outside of time, so why create Satan only so that Satan can rebel and then get thrown into hell...great! What is the point? Why create Satan in the first place? Is it for the amusement of seeing something suffer? . Eternity gets boring with no one to fight with.  ;)\n\nBut seriously, an interesting book on the subject is The Origin of Satan by Elaine Pagels.  It tells of how the view of Satan has changed from the Old Testament view of a divine agent into what most people recognize as Satan today and how that view may have been shaped by sociological factors.

"what is sex? Is it a mode of handing over life or mere physical enjoyment.Is there sex in the dust particles? . SEX has been claimed as lust and sin.\nLooking arround this planet's inside movement and out side in the skies there is total interaction of each and every existence.\nThrough this interaction, all arround,we experience LOVE, LIFE and Longing which is deep inside urge to merge in to one ness and realize this ONE NESS in totality.\nMale and female are not created seperately but exist as one .\nThis urge to be one from the physical duality to create and enjoy the creation is the source and self of so called GOD but a complete COSMIC conciousness which joins every thing visible or not visible.\nThis creative urge in the COSMIC order can be termed SEX or ""SOUL""S EXTERNAL X(over)and become part of the cosmic order at individual level.\nIt is unfortunate that Sex has been treated as a mode of pure physical enjoyment without conciousness of handing over life and feeling a part of the COSMIC order.\nmraju69@yahoo.com . Sex is the act we use to procreate. It is triggered by chemichals in our body that comepletely change our physical makeup.

I'm moving companies. How can I transfer my contacts from my old Microsoft Outlook to my new Outlook? .  . The Import and Export Wizard in Outlook makes it easy to export contact information from Outlook into an Excel worksheet (worksheet: The primary document that you use in Excel to store and work with data. Also called a spreadsheet. A worksheet consists of cells that are organized into columns and rows; a worksheet is always stored in a workbook.). \n\nNote  Before you use the wizard, it helps to understand the difference between the Outlook Address Book (Address Book: The collection of address books that you can use to store names, e-mail addresses, fax numbers, and distribution lists. The Address Book may contain a Global Address List, an Outlook Address Book, and a Personal Address Book.) and Outlook Contacts. Both are part of Outlook. However, the Address Book is a compilation of the different address lists you might have stored in Outlook, such as a Personal Address Book (.pab), LDAP (Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP): A protocol that provides access to Internet Directories.) Internet directories, the Global Address List (GAL) (Global Address List: The address book that contains all user, group, and distribution list e-mail addresses in your organization. The administrator creates and maintains this address book. It may also contain public folder e-mail addresses.), or other third-party address books. Contacts is just one of the address lists that make up the Address Book. Only contacts can be exported directly from Outlook to Excel.\n\n\nIn Outlook, on the File menu, click Import and Export. \nClick Export to a file, and then click Next. \nClick Microsoft Excel, and then click Next. \nIn the folder list, click the Contacts folder, and then click Next. \nBrowse to the folder where you want to save the contacts as an Excel file (.xls). \nType a name for the exported file, and then click OK. \nClick Next. \nTo add or remove fields to determine the way the contact information is saved in the new Excel worksheet, click Map Custom Fields. \nHow?\n\nIn the From box, drag the field you want to convert onto the Outlook field that is listed in the To box. \nNote  The Name field doesn't appear in the From box, because Outlook reserves the first row of a named (name: A word or string of characters in Excel that represents a cell, range of cells, formula, or constant value.) range (range: Two or more cells on a sheet. The cells in a range can be adjacent or nonadjacent.) for field names. If the range that you import does not contain field names, the first row of data will be interpreted as field names and will not be imported as data. To ensure that all of the data in the named range is imported, use the first row for field names.\n\nTo see additional records in the From box, click Previous or Next. \nTo remove all mapping, click Clear Map. \nTo reset the original mapping, click Default Map. \nTo display additional fields in the From box, click the plus sign (+) next to the field. For example, to display the Business Street and Business City fields, click the + next to Business Address. \nClick Finish.	Computers & Internet

Do you think today's schooling is too laid back? .  . Society is placing too much effort on recognizing the effort instead of valuing the quality of the product.  Schools are in a fight.  Schools want kids to get high quality education.  To demand that, they have to set high standards.  Parents don't want their kids feelings to be hurt.  And they place too much emphasis on making an excuse for why they should be given a break and not enough time telling the kid to buckle down and try harder.\n\nSchools are losing this battle... The parents are so worried about hurting their kids feelings, they are sacraficing discipline and work ethic.  Look around.  How many 20 year olds are still living with their parents?  How many kids expect to have a high paying job handed to them simply because they went to school and not because they deserve it?\n\nWe're in trouble, folks!	Education & Reference

While we're at it, why don't we just turn over our newborns for someone else to raise.

"want 2 learn Martel arts but which one?I'm quite small want 2b able 2defend myself if i got in a bad situation .  . Wing Chun kung-fu: Like most of the stylized kung-fu systems out there they get caught up in the who's instead of the why's and how's. The fixed positions and the inability to expand out of their systems fighting position leaves it vunerable to take downs, angled attacks, multiple person situations, and takes too long to implement the ideas to practical use.\n\nTaekwondo: You're represented by the biggest morons out there WTF and ATA. These orginizations are out for your money, boosting their prestige, and brain washing you into believing that there is a purpose to what they are doing. All the while, WTF specifically, handing you this crock of shit on how long taekwondo has been in existance. Because of their predjudice outlook toward the karate/Japanese culture in which it originated from they've developed a sport based on a game played over 1000 years ago and make people think they're actually learning how to defend themselves. They refuse to look toward proper training for fighting effectively taking them out of the true realm of martial arts. Now there are some fairly solid TKD orginizations out there but they're not represented by the vast majority thus undermining any attempt at validating their system.\n\nKempo: Like saying car, there is no true identity for this system of martial arts. Are we Japanese, American or Chinese. Who give a rats ass. Most systems have tried their damndest (is that really a word?) to validate a fairly effective group of fighting techniques while others get bogged down in the muck of trying to lay claim to some wierd Chinese Shaolin authenticity. Kenpo/Kempo has been represented over many years as some of the hardest hitting, most ferocious fighters in existance. There was a reason they became popular but because of greeed they watered it down to a state where you'd be lucky to find an instructor that wouldn't get you killed in your first encounter on the street. Now a majority of kempo guys are fat, out of shape bastards who are more interested in getting your check book then getting in shape. They have gone the way of TKD but fortunately most schools are changing for the better and maybe in the next decade or so they can rise to the prestige they deserve.\n\nShaolin Kung-fu/Wu Shu: Doesn't exist people it's fucking myth, as a martial arts you are learning to be a fucking gymnast/ballet dancer. Fucking stage performers are all they are. If you like that shit fine but stop licking the balls of these so called Chi masters as if most their stuff wasn't parlor tricks and simple athletic acrobatic techniques. Simple and to the point.\n\nOther systems of Kung-fu: if you aren't training in modern ways then you're not training in Kung-fu. Systems were not to be mired down to tradition they were supposed to change with the time, passing on techniques that worked and adding new ones on to make their respective kwoons ""bad ass"". Unfortunately you've all seen too many Jet Li and Jackie Chan circle jerk movies and believe half that shit is real. It's the fucking movies people get over it.\n\nJudo: Fucking turning into a bunch of pansies I swear, they outlaw so many moves we're soon going to be left with nothing but a pussified sumo match where only pushing is allowed.\n\nJujitsu: The problem here is identity. Like so many arts Jujitsu wears many masks and covers many different areas of grappling. Some Jujitsu systems look like modern MMA events while others are so bogged down in theoretical shit that they have no comprehension on what works and what doesn't work. Bottom line is if you haven't done it against a fully resisting opponent you'll have no idea if it'lll really work. Most of these practitioners get tied down to tradition and never question for a second their ""masters"" teaching because they've seen him/her throw some cooperative bitch around. Find Jujitsu that works people.\n\nBrazillian Juj"	Sports

What was existentialism? how about Trancendentalism? .  . Existentialism is a philosophical movement that is generally considered a study that pursues the meaning of life and seeks value for the existing individual. Existentialism, unlike other fields of philosophy, does not treat the individual as a concept, and values individual subjectivity over objectivity. As a result, questions regarding existence and subjective experience are seen as being of paramount importance, above all other scientific and philosophical pursuits.\n\nThere are several philosophical positions, all related to existential philosophy, but the main identifiable common proposition is that existence precedes essence, i.e. that a man exists before his existence has value or meaning. Man defines the value or meaning of both his existence and the world around him in his own subjectivity, and wanders between choice, freedom, and existential angst. Existentialism often is associated with anxiety, dread, awareness of death, and freedom. Famous existentialists include Sartre, Nietzsche, Kierkegaard, Heidegger, Camus, Fanon, and de Beauvoir.\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Existentialism\n\nTranscendentalism was a group of new ideas in literature, religion, culture, and philosophy that emerged in the New England region of the United States of America in the early-to mid-19th century. It is sometimes called American Transcendentalism to distinguish it from other uses of the word transcendental. \n\nTranscendentalism began as a protest against the general state of culture and society at the time, and in particular, the state of intellectualism at Harvard and the doctrine of the Unitarian church which was taught at Harvard Divinity School. Among their core beliefs was an ideal spiritual state that 'transcends' the physical and empirical and is only realized through the individual's intuition, rather than through the doctrines of established religions.\n\nProminent Transcendentalists included Ralph Waldo Emerson, Henry David Thoreau, Margaret Fuller, as well as Bronson Alcott, Orestes Brownson, William Ellery Channing, Frederick Henry Hedge, Theodore Parker, George Putnam, and Sophia Peabody, the wife of Nathaniel Hawthorne. For a time, Peabody and Hawthorne lived at the Brook Farm Transcendentalist utopian commune.\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcendentalism	Society & Culture

There used to be a lot of horror stories going around about swabs being inserted into the tip of the penis, because that's the way testing for chlamydia used to be performed. Now, STD clinics can test for chlamydia in urine. Syphilis testing and Hepatitis-C tests are blood tests. HIV testing can be done either by using blood or by OraSure, which is basically pressing a cotton pad in the mouth against the gumline and sending it off to a lab.\n\nI'm not sure if the swab is still being used for gonorrhea testing in men, but chlamydia is much more common in most parts of the U.S. than gonorrhea is.

Political system in the US? . How is the poltical system in the US?\nIÂ´m Austrian and i heart much about the votings in the US in he last time, but i don`t know how the politic works in the US? And what is the effect pf the losing of Bush an the Republicans? . bush hasnt lost his presidency yet.\n\nBasically the legislative branch of the government is divided into two sections. House of Representatives and the Senate. The House has 350+ members and the amount of memebers from each state is related to that states population. In the Senate each state gets two representatives. \n\nFor the past 6 years the House and the Senate have been controlled by the Republicans, and Bush is a Republican. He has been able to pass pretty much what ever he pleases b/c laws come from the House and The Senate and then the President has to sign them into law. So for the past 6 years the Republicans have been able to pretty much pass what ever they want and Bush signs it into law. Not to mention appointing two supreme court justices, which is debateably the most important job a president can do b/c justices rule for life.\n\nNow with the recent election the Democrats have won the House and are one state away from winning the Senate. Which would make laws with Republican agendas extremely hard to pass. Even if Dems dont win the senate, with the house in their control they will still be able to slow down Republican agenda, which is a great thing if you are a Dem with a Rebublican president.

Who agrees with me that this is the WORST officiated World Cup of all time? . I've just watched the Portugal vs Netherlands match and I am just astonished at the horrendous level of officiating by these referees. The referee for the Italy vs USA match of a week ago was equally atrocious and I'm sure Korean fans feel the same about the ref for their game against Switzerland. There is a very definite pattern here of too many players being booked. The Russian referee for tonight's match tied the all-time record for most yellow and red cards handed out in a game (16) and overall they've already broken the all-time record for most red cards handed out at a World Cup. This is just pitiful. Comments? . That ref in the Portugal/ Netherlands got an awful bad time of it I think and was blamed for letting the game 'out of his grip', but I looked at each decision he made and think he was justified in doing so!  I think the players were totally to blame, they went down too easily (especially the Dutch), which frustrated the Portugese, there was the incident with Figo  ( Red card offense in my opinion) which seeemed to ignite the sitaution.  The players were being stupid, the ref tried to get a grip on the game by booking severely , this back fired as the Dutch took full advantage of every over zealous Portugese tackle and the Portugese got frustrated and made some really stupid decisions.

Simeon the First See details? . ok so i am doing a report on Simeon the First (bulgaria) and i need all the information i can . what i really want is info on his five wars with the Byzantine empire the more sites the better. . The First Bulgarian Empire was able to defeat the Byzantine Empire in 811 and expand its territory eastward to the Black Sea, south to include Macedonia, and northwest to present-day Belgrade (see fig. 2). The kingdom reached its greatest size under Tsar Simeon (893-927), who presided over a golden age of artistic and commercial expansion. After moving deep into Byzantine territory, Simeon was defeated in 924. \n\nMeanwhile, Rome and Byzantium competed for political and cultural influence in Bulgaria. The Eastern Empire won in 870 when Bulgaria accepted Eastern Rite (Orthodox) Christianity and an autocephalous Bulgarian Church was established. This decision opened Bulgaria to Byzantine culture (and territorial ambitions) through the literary language devised for the Slavs by the Orthodox monks Cyril and Methodius. Establishment of a common, official religion also permanently joined the Bulgarian and Slavic cultures. \n\nAfter reaching its peak under Simeon, the First Bulgarian Empire declined in the middle of the tenth century. Byzantine opposition and internal weakness led to a loss of territory to the Magyars and the Russians. Bulgaria remained economically dependent on the Byzantine Empire, and the widespread Bogomil heresy (see Glossary) opposed the secular Bulgarian state and its political ambitions as work of the devil. Seeking to restore a balance of power in the Balkans, the Byzantines allied with the Kievan Russians under Yaroslav and invaded Bulgaria several times in the late tenth century. Although the Bulgarians expanded their territory again briefly under Tsar Samuil at the end of the tenth century, in 1014 the Byzantines under Basil II inflicted a major military loss. By 1018 all of Bulgaria was under Byzantine control. For nearly two centuries, the Byzantines ruled harshly, using taxes and the political power of the church to crush opposition. The first and second Crusades passed through Bulgaria in this period, devastating the land.	Education & Reference

"Is there any good tv shows about lawyers? . I am a student in Taiwan, and my major is Law, but my teachers want me to translate the Law terms into English. So I think maybe it's a good way to practise my English  by watching some related tv shows. If you know any one of them, please tell me,thanks! . Law & Order, seasons 1-15.  \n\nIn fact, this show was tagged as a ""procedural"".  You'll see a case (usually a murder), from the discovery of the victim's body by a civilian or a 'beat cop', to the arrest and charging of the main suspect (?), to the district attorney's summation and the verdict.  You'll see the detectives' investigative methods and the ""wheeling and dealing"" between the DA and the defense attorney and some of the techniques they use to press for more leads or evidence.  You'll also hear lots of law terminology.\n\nMake sure to get the ""original"" series, not the spin-offs, like Law & Order: CI (Criminal Intent), or Law & Order: SVU (Special Victims Unit).  They are even less ""procedural"".\n\nSadly, in more recent seasons, the show strays from procedure (no more summation), and increases the drama elements such as interpersonal story/history.

purpose for our tonsils? .  . They are part of the lymphatic system (which is connected to the circulatory system) which play a huge role in immunological defenses against diseases.\n\nThere are two kinds of tonsils in our throats: \n\npharyngeal and palatine tonsils\n\nBoth pairs are filter-protective regions of the body that help to collect bacteria and other pathogens from entering the body. When they are all clogged up from a huge onslaught of germs, like in tonsilitis, then they may or may not be able to filter and protect the body, and may actually be a place that harbors streptococcus microbes and contibute to re-infection.  \n\nTonsillectomies used to be done a lot more than they are now, but tonsillectomy may help reduce the number of ear-nose-throat infections if aggressive antibiotic treatments have not been affective. Chronic strept throat can infect the heart and cause endocarditis and rheumatic heart disease.  So when your tonsils are WORKING, they do help protect the heart and other parts of the body that may be vulnerable to the microbes being transported around in the circulatory system.\n\nAlways throw out your tooth brush after strept throat or soak brush in hydrogen peroxide of alcohol before each use. This might help reduce the chances of reinfection.	Health

"Why are poeple afraid of Genetically modified plants? . I find this an interesting question, because I don't think that we can survive without these plants.  For instance plants that help us feed more people- how can that be bad?  I have heard of people firebombing labs that work on this stuff- but why?  At the rate of population growth, there needs to be some answer, and right now, GMOs seem to be the only real feasible solution.  I am interested to know why people are afraid of these organisms? . I agree with kurdiatcha - IGNORANCE is the major factor causing people to be afraid of GMO. Many people with no scientific training (at least the ones I talked to) do not quite understand what GM really is and confuse it with pesticide usage, food preservatives and any other sorts of chemical treatments. Driven by fear they ""educate"" themselves from popular pseudo-scientific websites, which scare them with allegedly GMO-associated treats, such as cancer or Alzheimer's disease. Eventually these people would rather purchase a non-modified product, which, however, had been treated with all sorts of pesticides because of its lack of superior resistance introduced  by GM. \nI believe that proper education would take care of these sometimes irrational fears, and that is the way to go."

We dont know what to do, we visit when we can, but dont know if we should spend constant time there or not. . Contact hospice they will decide if he should be on the program. You have to promise not to call the EMT.  When he has a problem hospice will resolve it for you. If you place him in a hospital without hospices permission you are off the program.  The Dr, statement is a good reason for hospice.  Also because you will get 24hr. 7days a week support.  Whatever hospice recommend Medicare will pay for. Medical equipment medicines aide Rn supervision once a week unless you will call with a problem. Then they will come      whenever night or day, someone is always on call.  If the person doesn't die they are not removed from the program unless they are cured. They will be kept as comfortable as possible.  A social worker will visit once a week . On call if other visits are needed. All sorts of support people are provided and paid for.  The down side as far as I am concerned is that they will not provide IV fluids just for hydration.

treatment of osteoporosis? . treatment-menopausal osteoporosis . It is well established that estrogen replacement during menopause protects bone mass and helps protect against the risk of osteoporotic fractures. The accelerated bone loss during menopause has little relationship to the amount of calcium intake. After age 60, however, the proper attention to calcium intake is very important and has been shown to increase bone density. An important study published in 1992 showed that elderly women who took supplemental dietary calcium (with vitamin D) had a 30% less fractures (including hip fractures) than similar women who did not take supplemental calcium. When these investigators looked at these women again 3 years later, they still had a significantly less rate of fractures, and, they had a 15 % decreased chance of death. Most endocrinologists feel that the use of calcium supplements are safe (and inexpensive) and recommend it to most (all?) elderly men and women unless specific contraindications exist. it helps to take calcium with vitman d in them ..

Homo sapiens = alien species? . Recorded history in relative terms of time over billions of years does not indicate nor disregard the possibility of humans being considered as an alien species. Astronomers are finding hundreds of new planets outside our solar system, expecting to find millions more... let alone the vast greatness of alternative galaxies and space itself. \n\nWe as humans actually do not have a history or origin. It is not possible to deny or to confirm that we are from alien origin. Has Homo X perhaps found this earth a billion years ago in search of their survival? \n\nAre we expecting strange creatures? We are most likely the strangest creatures ever.. consider nature and all the various shapes and forms and textures. \n\nAlso, if history has been denied to human beings simply because over a billion years man was unable to record and transfer information (and perhaps a higher source thought it to be necessary), then one should consider the possibilities of such a theory.. we could be the invaders.. . Well, certainly an interesting theory. I cannot deny that we are aliens..but it is highly unlikely. Perhaps at the most ..in my opinion, we have alien DNA in us. \nI have never met an alien yet, and truly I really don't want to. But it is hard to deny the existence of intelligent beings. They seem to have been with us since recorded history of mankind began. Maybe they even helped us evolve (that's where DNA comes into play with my theory). I mean their UFOs have been spotted and recorded in drawings on cave walls, paintings, carvings on canvas, and then recorded on film and digital recordings.  \nI never believed..never really gave it much thought. That was until I had seen so much, many objects and crafts I could not deny it any longer. \nAre we alien? Perhaps we are like an ant farm or a little petri dish with a culture or organism in it and they are the scientists trying to be careful not to contaminate the experiment (thus the attempts to erase the memories of supposed abdutees withhout permanent brain damage). \nI don't think there are many on this planet that actually do know the truth..but I do think there are some here who do. We are VERY young. We have not been here very long, and we cannot understand the universe with our primitive minds..The way we think with Human brain prevents us. Certainly there are more people aware of UFOs then ever before and also more sightings than we have ever known. The frequency of sightings is increasing..\nLast year was a record for myself with four objects sighted in three months, while I was at a my fairly secluded lake. These crafts are not ours. They have instant speed..speed that you cannot believe, even as you witness it. Speed that we cannot achieve on Earth. \nPerhaps the time will come soon, when we all will learn of their true existence and ours. Maybe then, we might begin learn to understand what the universe has in store for us.

The direction of the dipole moment corresponds, for electric dipoles, to the direction from the negative to the positive charge. For magnetic dipoles, the dipole moment points from the magnetic south to the magnetic north pole â confusingly, the ""north"" and ""south"" convention for magnetic dipoles is the opposite of that used to describe the Earth's geographic and magnetic poles, so that the Earth's geomagnetic north pole is the south pole of its dipole moment. Because of the absence of magnetic monopoles, magnetic dipoles are actually created by current loops or by quantum-mechanical spin.\n\nSince the direction of an electric field is defined as the direction of the force on a positive charge, electric field lines point away from a positive charge and toward a negative charge.\n\nWhen placed in an electric or magnetic field, equal but opposite forces arise on each side of the dipole creating a torque Ï:\n\nÏ = p x E  (for an electric dipole moment p) (measured in coulomb-meters)\n\nor\n\nÏ = m x B = u0m x H  (for a magnetic dipole moment m) (measured in ampere-square meters).\n\nThe resulting torque will tend to align the dipole with the applied field."

Do you know that faith in creation or God is best, because scientific THEORIES are impossible? . You don't get the complexities all around us, particularly regarding life,  from chaos. \n    So, scientific theories about the origin of things are impossible. Period.     I say again, those theories are impossible. It would NEVER happen. NEVER.Things are so complex, you do not even want to know what the odds are.   It is ridiculous to not believe in God.  No wonder scripture calls unbelief foolish! . You are right!  God's way is the best way and there is no way around it!!!! Those 'theories' are so not logical!  I am NOT a monkey!  GO GOD!

i need game ideas for work to help motivate coworkers to sell salon products? . i am in charge of our product sales at my salon and i need game ideas to help motivate and give them something to work for . I would try something like ~ a paid day (of half of day) off for the person who sells the most product or the highest dollar amount (that makes them up-sell). Or they could get a free lunch at the place of their choice (with limitations),not only are they getting a free lunch but you can attend with them and that gives the opportunity for bonding. I'm not sure how much authority you have but those suggestions always work in my place of employment.\n\nIf you want long term~ make the stakes a little larger. Try something like ~ Highest amount of sales over a specific period of time gets you a weekend getta way at a hotel.\nOf course don't forget to take into account that you can't spend more than you are profiting.

How is the u.s. doing so bad in the world baseball classic, and korea, a horrible team at baseball doing  good .  . I think the U.S. is so lucky to win one game in the 2nd round of the classic in their game against Japan.  Or should I say, they robbed Japan of the win b'coz it's clearly seen in the replays that the Japanese player didn't leave early to make a run home.  \n\nBoth the Japanese and Koreans are doing well because I believe even before the other teams are practicing or preparing for the tournament, they've been ahead of them when it comes to preparation.  \n\nAlso, even the past years the Asian teams are doing well in international competitions than the US.  That's because not only in Basesball, even in Basketball, the US doesn't prepare as long as the Asian teams do.  I won't be surprised if the Japanese and Korean team are preparing for the classic since mid December.	Sports
How can I heal from a depresion that has lasted 9 years? . IÂ´ve tried almost every chemical antidepresant you can imagine, for example, Paxil and so on. The medication I am taking now is Eskalith CR 450 mg. (lithium) and Lamictal 250 mg. Psychotherapy has been of no use, in my opinion. Religion helps a little but not enough. I live by myself and that doesnÂ´t help very much. I have very few friends and almost no social life. I would like to change my negative thought patterns, may be with Dr. FeuersteinÂ´s method (the only problem is that the benefit will come long term), IÂ´d like to try echinotherapy (riding horses), maybe bio dance, etc, etc. I just donÂ´t want to keep trying so many methods with no results. I regret not having finished my studies in college. I am 27 years old. I just feel IÂ´m stuck, IÂ´m in a hole, that my life is not advancing and improving how it should be. . First of all, you just identified what is making you feel bad ... you feel bad for not completing college!  That's simple to fix, enroll in college again and get your degree.  Even if it's just at the local community college it'd be a great start and you'd feel like you're working toward something.\n\nI've also struggled with anxiety and depression and I'm on lamictal as well.  One of the best things that improved my self esteem was that I applied to two graduate programs in subjects I was interested in, and now I feel like I have goals and am moving forward in my life.  I still feel depressed at times, but I'm feeling a lot better.\n\nOne more thing I want to recommend is emotions anonymous -- talking to other people who feel like you do is an awesome way to work through your problems, make friends and feel less alone.

"It is found that universe is expanding,then isn't it the violation of 'law of gravitation'.? .  . It actually follows the laws of gravity. Even when gravity is present, it is possible to reach a velocity that can escape gravity.\n\nTechnically, with gravity the universe should collapse back upon itself and the big bang would occur all over again. However, gravity is one of the weakest forces in the universe. With that said, it has been measured that the universe is expanding and accelerating at a rate that exceeds the gravitational forces required to initiate the ""big crunch.""\n\nThere are two schools of thought right now. One is that the universe will continue to decelerate but never completely stop or collapse upon itself. More recent theories have stated that the universe appears to be accelerating.\n\nAs it stands now, I would say that it is safe to say that the odds are extremely low of the universe collapsing back to a singularity."

"How come there are an abundant found species of snakes in Australia, but no snakes in Hawaii? .  . Oh great another question with multiple answers by people who have no frickenâ idea what they are talking about.\n\n>>>>How come there are an abundant found\n>>>> species of snakes in Australia, but no snakes\n>>>>> in Hawaii?\n\nFirst off lets clear up the common misconception that there are no snakes in Hawaii. There are no LAND snakes in Hawaii. There most certainly are sea snakes in Hawaii.\nThere are no LAND snakes in Hawaii because Hawaii has only existed for the blink of an eye in geological time. Because it is so new all the animals and plants in Hawaii have had to arrive there by travelling across the ocean from nearby landmasses. Hawaii is far too far away from the nearest landmass with snakes for land snakes to be able them to swim that distance.  \n\nFor the same reason Hawaii also has no native land reptiles, amphibians or land mammals of any kind.  Several species of reptiles and mammals have hitched rides with people or been deliberately introduced to the islands, but so far no snakes.\n\nIn contrast Australia as old as any landmass on Earth. snakes evolved in or near Australia when it was still part of the supercontinents. \n\n______________________\nGuelph said âDuring the last ice age, sea levels were low enough that\n>>>>>>> the Indonesian islands formed a virtual landbridge to Australia.\n\nThere was no land bridge, virtual or otherwise. More importantly snakes and their ancestors have been present in Australia since before it split from Gondwana. No land bridge was needed or used.\n\nKari said âSnakes may have been brought into Australiaâ. This is total rubbish. There are no exotic snakes living in Australia outside of zoos. No snakes have been brought into Australia. They have more than enough of their own.\n\nCeciel who is obviously a graduate of the Simpsonâs school of biological control, is clearly planning to release Himalayan Mountain gorillas to Hawaii deal with the mongooses.\n\nKnowlegdeSeeker said "" Colubrids, the progenitors of modern >>>>>> snakes started to show up about 36M years ago.""\n\nColubrids are NOT the pregenitors of modern snakes. \n\nColubrids are one of the three major types of modern venomous snakes, the other being the elapids and viperids (See link 1 below.)Colubrids are not a very significant part of the Australian snake fauna and restricted mostly to the northern parts of the continent (see links 2 below). For that reason they are indeed believed to be fairly recent immigrants (See link 3 below).\n\nThe first snakes show up in the fossil record some 100 million years ago in South America, when, as the website you posted shows, Australia was still very much part of Gondwana. In fact the best early snake fossils all come from Gondwana (including present day Australia) and snakes were widepread across that supercontinent by the mid cretaceous, well before it broke up (See remaining links for details).\n\nAfter that the record gets patchy. In fact snakes are amongst the worst represented of all the vertebrate groups. But the general consenus amongst palaeontologists is that snakes evolved in Gondwana and radiated from there to the rest of the world. As a group they never moved into Australia unless it was form South America when the two landmasses were still connected. No land bridge required."	Science & Mathematics
which do you think is better home school public school or private school and why? . help me and my husbund make up our  mind . Really, it depends on the pupil. \n\nHomeschooling provides more of a one on one education. Special needs can be paid closer attention to or help in a particular area can be attended. However home schooled students tend to lack social experience and a large cultural variety of peers. The student also misses out on opportunities such as student government, sports, or clubs.\n\nPublic school provides a variety of subjects and usually teaches them fairly well, in my experience. However class sizes tend to be larger and sometimes struggling students are over looked. Students usually have opportunities to take classes based on interests and their grades. There is usually a variety of culture at public schools and a large student body with peers. Socially, public school students blossom.\n\nPrivate school students usually receive excellent educations as the subjects tend to be slightly more advanced. Class sizes are usually smaller meaning struggling students get more help. Private schools tend to have better extracurriculars, because of tuition money. However, the student body may be limited and lacking in diversity. Often students who board at their school can receive a taste for college life and be more prepared than other students.

Who is guilty of murder in Iraq? . The technical and therefore legal difference between the meaning of 'murder' and 'killing' is very grey. It is used in legalise to defend the actions of US and UK soldiers as 'justified homocide' or as 'legal killing' of innocent citizens *by accident, cough* but not in defence of the Iraqi insurgents who are also engaged in a war (against an occupier) who have been downgraded as 'terrorists' to somehow grade inhumanity as 'OK' as long as it is officially supported by HM Government but 'not OK' for the Arabs because they have no institutional support. The ethical posturing by HM's Law Lords is therefore very unreliable in this highly hypocritical context. . sorry pal, but legally you're sitting on air. no soldier engaged in combat operations is guilty of murder so long as he is within the parameters of the operation, if and when he kills an entire family so he can rape a female, then he's guilty of murder. and only then	Politics & Government

Probably bannish you from ever seeing her again. At this point i would stay close to her, but not close enough to touch, she has alot of growing up to do before shes ready for the kind of relationship your ready for. Just let her know that you care and she can come to you with all of her problems. But make sure you dont create any problems for her by showing her how you feel completely. I know its a complex situation, but you can handle your feelings being trapped inside for a few years that what she can handle knowing how you feel and not being able to act on them, at least with out any serious consequences.

"How did World War I end? . I need the exact answer . In 1916, Hindenburg and Ludendorf initiated ""War Socialism"" upon the German economy, because they felt they were being cheated by German industrialists who had successfully been able to find chemical replacements for the items kept out of Germany by the British blockade (ie-Ammonium to replace Nitrates for gunpowder, wood pulp to replace cotton for artillery wadding, etc). From that point on, German industry and German agriculture began a comprehensive effort to force the German government to rescind this order by pretending they could not fill any orders for war materials.\n\nEven though Germany posessed the coal fields of Silesia and the Ruhr, plus the Iron mines of Lorraine as well as sea access across the Baltic to Iron mines of Sweden, German industry made weapons only with the metals provided by the government by melting down church bells and only made bullets with the melted down lead from window panes and plumbing pipes. Even though Germany had conquered Rumania, Poland and Ukraine (which consituted over 80% of the pre-war agricultural imports to Germany), by 1918 almost half a million Germans had starved to death. The artillery had gone so long without new cannons that more often than not they ended up shelling their own positions. The Army bread was more sawdust than wheat.\n\nAs this sabotage from within continued, the soldiers in the Army became more dissatisfied and many deserted in the attempt to find work so their families would not lose their homes or go hungry. Whenever there was a protest against the war, the protestors were not jailed but inducted into the Army, where they became the seed for even more disillusion within the ranks.\n\nHitler was right and wrong. Germany was stabbed in the back but not by the Jews. Germany was stabbed in the back by the capitalists, who thirteen years later would conspire to end German democracy and install Hitler as their partner. This was the only partnership that Hitler, in the end, would honor completely."	Education & Reference

What should I look for when buying a personal computer? . I need to know what kind of computer is good for a college student to have.  What kind of software and hardware is useful?  What kind of processor is the best to have? How long should is it expected life? . HP makes excellent all-around laptops. However, if it's for a student, I'd go with Dell simply because of their great warranty and support. Whatever laptop you decide to buy, make sure you also purchase an extended warranty. Things happen all the time to laptops when kids are at school. Beer spills on the keyboard, they drop them, they never update them or take care of them, etc... \n\nYour student needs to have the following software: Microsoft Office, Norton Internet Security (Firewall and Anti-virus), Spybot/Adware, and Mozilla Firefox. \n\nThe best kind of processor for a student is a dual core one. Students are often managing multiple tasks at one time, whether it be engineering, math, physics, etc... they need power. I suggest going with AMD Athlon Dual Core. \n\nThe expected life often depends on how good of care the laptop receives. It must have regular maintenance done to it, much like   a car. But keep in mind, anything can go wrong with a laptop. Batteries die, keyboards stop working, cables become bad, etc...like I said before, get the extended warranty and you'll be fine. Often times with those, if something is seriously wrong, the store in which you purchased it will give you a brand new laptop.	Computers & Internet

Here's some questions for my fellow Americans (Liberals/Democrats).? . A good portion of you hold the views of helping others,and that you wish to help everyone.You love peace and freedom.Social programs are your answer.The government should persecute the rich because it's not fair they earned more than you legally.\n\nSo my question is this-\nIf you love democracy so much,why do all of your beliefs mirror the communist governments and dictatorships that all of you are supposed to hate so much?\n\nI mean isn't America about freedom?Freedom over your own life?If you choose to be poor because you don't want to take the risk to make it rich,isn't that your own fault,not the government's?\n\nOne other question-\nYou can create and institute all the social programs you want.But if no one uses them because they'd rather stay the way they are,what good are they?You can't force people to use any program,just create it and hope they use it.But aren't things like welfare and the like a scourge to society?\nPlease use logic in your answers,not emotions. . As a supporter of the progressive movements within the Democratic, Republican and Green Parties, I find agreement among progressive liberals and conservatives on permanent solutions to poverty, ranging from business coops (i.e., fair trade where more profits are managed by farmer-worker cooperatives) and Microcredit Financing and business training. Both are proven successful in breaking the poverty cycle without handouts and with respect to free enterprise.\n\nYou are right, the current welfare system is such a scourge, it is widely protested by welfare recipients themselves, organized through activist groups such as the Welfare Warriors, because it punishes people for taking steps toward becoming independent and rewards remaining helpless.  \n\nMicrocredit, however, is based on creating financial independence, through programs such as the Grameen Bank which won a Nobel Prize for their success in Bangladesh and worldwide. The branch in Dallas, Texas, collaborates with public institutions, including the Federal Reserve, on similar educational programs where microloan applicants receive free training to new business owners to manage finances under a successful business plan.\n\n(2) The reason both liberal Democrats and conservative Republicans come across to the other as imposing a dictatorship by their agendas is that the bipartisan political system of voting by majority rule encourages such campaigns.\n\nThis polarized system is easily played and manipulated in the media, since only 51% vote is required to defeat the opposing side.  So instead of encouraging cooperation on common solutions, as I credit Colin Powell for advocating publicly, the media campaigns are focused on creating and perpetuating opposition, to sell air time and ratings as any other competitive sport.  However, human rights and freedoms are not a football game; democracy is not a spectator sport but involves all people where the point is for everyone to win, not to divide into two teams and fight to the death.  So I blame the abuse of the political system for why people posture behind symbolic representations, using Republican and Democratic leaders as red and blue poker chips in a never ending gamble, instead of taking real money and real ideas and investing directly in joint solutions that everyone can agree on.  \n\nOnly the most progressive Green, Democrat and Republican activists think on this level, and seek to work across party lines on real solutions to immigration and crime issues, welfare and government bureaucracy, and legal and judicial reform, among other problems that the current system fails to address.\n\nAs a self-critical member of the Democratic Party, I see the solution emerging among members of the various parties who are seeking to work together to overcome partisan biases that are obstructing political progress.  There are more books and advocates speaking out on the need for change in this direction, which I believe will allow real solutions to be implemented.\n\nhttp://www.houstonprogressive.org/hypocrisy.html\nhttp://www.houstonprogressive.org/mediahype.html\nhttp://www.houstonprogressive.org/isocracy.html	Society & Culture

"Which RNA pol transcribes mRNA? .  . Transcription is the process of creating an RNA copy of one's DNA or mRNA.  RNA polymerase is responsible for this process.  This process is very important because mRNA is then used in ""translation"" to form proteins by means of a Ribosome.  \n\nYou need a TATA box for transcription.  There are three types of RNA polymerase: types 1, 2 and 3.  Type 3 RNA Polymerase typically are the ones with the TATA boxes.\n\nTake a look at this website to watch how RNA polymerase synthesizes a new mRNA through transcription:\nhttp://www.phschool.com/science/biology_place/biocoach/transcription/complete.html\n\nHave fun!"

"Where did ""bachelor parties"" originate from? .  . ""More commonly known today as the bachelor party, this celebration in the groom's honor was originally called the bachelor dinner, or stag party. Like many other wedding traditions, the custom has stood the test of time. It first came about in the fifth century, in Sparta, where military comrades would feast and toast one another on the eve of a friend's wedding. Even today, a bachelor party customarily takes place quite close to the actual wedding date, as it has become known as the groom's last taste of freedom. Despite the risquÃ© entertainment that is associated with stag parties today, bachelor parties have not always entailed this controversial element. Although rowdy and boisterous, bachelor parties are traditionally organized to allow the jittery groom and his wedding attendants to release some anxieties before the big day.\n"""	Family & Relationships

How many of you consider yourselves feminist? . I am a feminist. I converted to Islam precisely because of all the religions I've encountered, Islam was the best choice for me (I am an equity feminist, and while Islam teaches spiritual equality of men and women, it also teaches social equity of men and women). Even in its purest form, there are some things about Islam that I struggle with evey day-- so, if you are a feminist, how do you reconcile your religious beliefs (Whatever they may be)?\n\n**Disclaimer**\nAlso, I am not looking for insults or misogynist comments. If  you have them, please save them for some other time. I am genuinely concerned with how non-misogynist women and men reconcile with the mostly (and mainstream) patriarchal attitudes of religions. I am NOT trying to say any one religion is more misogynist than any other. . Though I hesitate to call myself feminist (mostly due to an internal debate over whether a man can truly be a feminist); I do try to uphold some of the beliefs of both the early suffragette movement, and the change in social mores in the 1960s and 1970s. That is, gender (and racial though that is a different topic) equality in matters of politics, socio-economics, and spiritaulity.\n\nAs for reconciling attitudes between my own beliefs and those of the patriarchal religions; quite frankly, I couldn't. Experience with my extended family gave me an extremely biased view of leadership dynamics. Due to my mother's family, I began to tie the presence of strong female influence, leadership and direction to long-term stability and strong ties within a family. This idea was reinforced over the course of three generations: my mother, my mother's mother, my maternal grandmother's mother and sisters, as well as my maternal grandfather's mother and sister all presented strong female role models and true partnerships with their husband. It is interesting to note that while a good number of my maternal great-aunts and great-uncles (sisters/brothers of grandparents) do affiliate with the (Roman Catholic or other Christian) church, the majority are FWEC Christians.\nMy father's family, on the other hand, had a strong paternal influence within the household; or rather, the influence of my paternal grandmother was purposefully muted due to prevailing influence and ideals of the Catholic Church during her childhood. Their family dynamic, in the past twenty years, has been punctuated by arguments, divorce, and what can only be described as very poor judgement.\n\nI never truly had to reconcile my own learned beliefs with those of the church for two main reasons: first, I was not raised in the church. I sought the church on my own around as a pre-teen and chose the Congregational Church specifically because of it's stand on female clergy (allowed).	Society & Culture

"Do catholics feel guilty if they have premarital sex and are living with that person? . Well... I'm a catholic and have been 'intimate' with my boyfriend (who does not have a religion) for almost 2 years now... We have been living together now for 4 months. I am a devout catholic, but I did make the decision to have sex. And everytime it happens I can't fully enjoy it without having that small thought in my head that I am a very horrible person and that I'm very dirty and sick and immoral for doing this. \n\nI just basically wondered if other people out there who are catholic and having premarital sex, how they feel about it. . I completely kow how you feel I went through the same thing with my husband the only man I was ever with and still with. I couldnt wait for him to marry me so I could finally enjoy our sexual relations,I even remember crying during sex the guilt was so bad and I'm not even Catholic but in my faith along with most this is a major sin.  I dont your stat with you boyfriend but it wont get better until he marries you .  I bet you had parents who made you feel like everything you did you go to hell for.  I will end it saying this even though it will only help if you can truly belive it yourself ""God is mericiful,and his mercy out weights his wrath"",also I bet you boyfreind thinks your parents brainwashed the hell into you to make you feel this way and he probably hates your religion because of that..Good Luck I hope you can have a wholesome satisfing relationship soon and feel good about your relationship with god."

"Why does she keep blowing me off!!!!!? . alright, I've been involved in a long distance relationship with a wonderful girl for about 3 months or so. It's been rocky but then stabilized. However, recently I've been feeling like she doesn't care that much anymore and her actions prove that. For example, I call her and she'll say that she'll call me in a few minutes when she's done watching TV and I'm like ok, cool, no biggee. But then when she calls she tells me she's going to sleep! It's very frustrating! So I let that go b/c people get tired, right? So next day I call and she doesn't answer. No biggee, right? people get busy. So I thought I would get a call back sometime that day but no call! Why does she keep blowing me off?!? This keeps happening but then when we finally talk she uses her ""cute"" voice with me and tells me how much she loves me, etc, etc. All I know is that this hurts me and I'm afraid she won't understand. What should I do? . i think you should stop calling her. I realize it will be difficult as sounds as though you really care for her but she is playing with your feelings. Sounds like she is out for her and not ready to be in a relationship. A friend of mine just went through something similar. Each time he got hurt more and more.

What are my retirement options if my employer does not offer a 401k or pension plan? .  . As the other people have said, you can start either a regular IRA or a Roth IRA.  The money in these can be invested in a CD at a bank or into a number of other items, such as mutual funds.  The problem with having just the IRA is that you are limited as to how much you can invest.\nBesides the IRA, you may want to think about investing in an annuity.  In an annuity, you earnings grow tax deferred until retirement.  At retirement, you can have the money paid out as a lifetime income.  There generally is no limit as to how much money you can invest in the annuity.\nThere are different types of annuities.  You can get fixed, indexed, or variable ones.\nThe best thing I would recommend is talk to a financial representative to help you decide which plan best meets your needs.	Business & Finance

"Do wild cattle exist? .  . According to the encyclopedia, which is very accurate here in this case:\n\n""A bovid is any of almost 140 species of cloven-hoofed mammals belonging to the family Bovidae. The family is widespread, being native to all continents except Australia and Antarctica, and diverse: members include buffalo, bison, antelopes, gazelles, and both wild and domesticated cattle, sheep, goats, and water buffalo.""\n\n""The biological subfamily Bovinae (or bovines) includes a diverse group of about 24 species of medium-sized to large ungulates, including domestic cattle, Bison, the Water Buffalo, the Yak, and the four-horned and spiral-horned antelopes. The evolutionary relationship between the members of the group is obscure, and their classification into loose tribes rather than formal sub-groups reflects this uncertainty. General characteristics include a cloven-hoof and usually at least one of the sexes of a species having a true horn.""\n\nHowever, the domestic cattle species Bos taurus that you see on farms is extinct in the wild. Wild cattle today is not the same species as domestic cows and bulls. Wild cattle belong to the same family and in some cases same subfamily and look very, very similar, but they are not the same exact species. A gaur is wild cattle of India. There's the Cambodian Forest Ox, several other types of wild cattle."	Science & Mathematics

Here's my problem: not one of my American friends is able to pronounce my German first name properly and I've seen as many different spellings of it as I have friends.\nMy Dutch friend Michiel had the same problem,  just called himself Mick and that worked.\nSo I've got to find a nickname that is easily understandable and pronouncable for a native speaker of English. And it should also be somewhat close to my German name which is SÃ¶nke (pronounced something like: ZOIN-kah).\nAll my friends came up with was Sonny which I didn't really like.\nAny better ideas? . Hi, here are my ideas:\n\n1) Nick - just because there is the N and the K out of your name, and I like it, and it's definitely a name everyone can pronounce. Kind of like taking out the center part of your name and making it pronouncable.\n\n2) Ben - because SÃ¶nke is ""norddeutsch/friesisch"" for ""SÃ¶hnchen"" or ""kleiner Sohn"" (little son, as you surely know), and Ben is one of several Yiddish words for son.\n\n3) Mac - which is Irish and Scots Gaelic for son\n\n4) Fiz - because it's kind of close to the Sardinian word ""fizzu"" meaning son, and because I think Fiz sounds kind of cool.\n\n5) Sam - for no good reason other than that it's easy to pronounce and begins with an S and I like it"	Society & Culture

I need advice...? . Mmkay so here's the deal. There's this guy...let's call him Josh. And I have a friend who's friends with him (She'll be Jackie, mmkay?). So, I've liked Josh all through last year. We used to talk a lot in our classes last year. But sometime around January I did something that I'm guessing upset him (Although, in my opinion and my friends' opinions it wasn't a big deal) I tried a billion times to get him to forgive me, but he totally refused to. We stopped talking after what happened. And this year we don't even have classes together, so it's like we're total strangers. (But I go to a semi-small school so I pass him going to classes a lot) \n\nWhen Jackie asked him if he was mad at me, he told her that he hated me. Then later he said he disliked me, not hated me. Then about a month later when asked again he said he hated me. Then when she asked if he was still mad, around April, he said he didn't really care anymore. (So I guess he was neutral about it?)

"When is the most appropriate time to come out of the closet to your parents? .  . The sooner the better. They may be hurt or angry or confused - but the sooner you get it out there the sooner you can all talk about it and you won't have to feel like you are hiding it from them. It is too depressing when you can't be yourself completely - it depends on your parents and their personalities and beliefs as to how they might react...but the sooner you do it the better and the more time you will have to let them get used to it. They may want you to go to a counselor or talk to someone else about it. You need to do this because more than likely the counselor is going to be someone you can talk to openly and it is confidential- they can not tell your parents anything without your consent. And it is important that you have someone to talk to that you can trust. It will be an adjustment for your parents. Your parents may think they did something wrong to ""make"" you gay. They may be sad and think they will never have grandchildren, etc... They may believe that homosexuality is a choice and expect you to change your mind, or think it is a phase and think you will grow out of it. It is important that you are patient with them as they will have to work through their own feelings about the matter. But the sooner you talk to them about it the sooner you can all work on getting through it together."	Society & Culture

"Precautions to be taken after Aoric valve replacement surgery? . My FIL had successful Aortic valve replacement surgery of Heart recently.  He is recovering slowly.  Please mention do's and don'ts under the circumstances. . Aortic valve replacement recovery is a lot like open heart surgery recovery (indeed most AVR has at least one bypass too).  Recovery is very individual.  It is highly dependent on the shape of the patient PRIOR to the surgery.  People who were largely sedentary, have multiple concurrent diseases (diabetes, kidney insufficiency, COPD, etc) tend to take even longer than the average to recover - likewise healthy active people tend to bounce back from the surgery.  \n\nRegardless it will take 12 months before your FIL is fully recovered.  The first month is the worst and progress is typically slow.  The next few months also have a steep curve but it gets increasingly better.  He should be about 90% at six months.  The next six months with garner gradual improvements for several more months.\n\nOne mistake people make is that they continue to observe the directions provided them the week after they are discharged from the hospital, months even a year later.   Activity should be ""as tolerated.""  If you CAN do more, you SHOULD do more. \n\nGentle physicial activity is fine and recommended as tolerated; for instance, with walking, progressively more and more as tolerated, it is very hard to over do it.  On the other hand training for a marathon is over the top.\n\nLifting or carrying very much weight at all (20 pounds or less) is not recommended until at least eight weeks after the surgery.  That gives the sternum time to heal.  Pain with lifting may still be evident months later while the bone continues to heal - but after 8 weeks it is hard to do damage.\n\nIt is common to have plueral effusions - fluid around the lung bases as part of the healing process.  This often causes shortness of breath, reduced appetite, and difficulty breathing with laying flat.  If effusions are present, they can be found by chest xray.  A diuretic (or extra diuretic) can be added to help them resolve.  \n\nWhen appetite comes back, I usually feel like the patient has turned the corner on recovery.  Patients tend to do very well from there on out.\n\nDepression is very, very common after this procedure.  Your FIL should be evaluated by his PCP for this problem.  If evident then it should be treated.  It will make a large difference in the speed of his recovery.  Note:  men sometimes are hostile or angry rather than sad when depressed.\n\nLastly I would encourage your FIL to participate in a cardiac rehab program - even if its a long drive, etc.  It is very important to interact with others who are going through the same thing.  Also it is important to have a professional encouraging your FIL to increase his activity, etc.\n\nI hope this helps.  Good luck."	Health

"So you are not ready to accomodate a naive lover? . Is it the reality that it is not enough for a guy to be good and love the woman he wants. He needs to learn how to get her and may be he needs to shed off his good boy nature and rather be naughty towards her? There are even books which suggests about this... and what do you think? There will be no place for real hearts, only those learned robots who tickles would be the winner? Is successful love (leading to love making) most of the time a designed mechanical game instead of a natural? . I wouldn't call it a designed mechanical game.  I would say however that the game is called ""life"" and the ""designed mechanics"" be called something like learned responses, or adapted behaviors.   It's a matter that people are social beings, and that compromise (especially of self-character) happens to get what you want out of social interactions.\n\nThere is a place for real hearts, but real hearts don't go out looking for love, they wait until the right moment to fall in love.  9 out of 10 times, women don't want that, they want the alpha male of the group.  Women are genetically predisposed to want the best genetic makeup for her offspring.  She will not want the nice guy looking for love, she wants the alpha male.\n\nShe may end up settling for the nice guy (hence nice guys finish last), but she originally wants sed alpha male.\n\nGood boy nature is rather shy, quiet, and timid.  Naughty boy nature shows interaction, flirting, and ultimately confidence.  Most of the time, and those that end up breeding, are breeding with yes, the ""learned robots"".  Human emotions have no real place in this world (as far as securing your genes and passing it on to future generations)."	Family & Relationships

Is there anyway to back out of a grant given to you by a college? . My college offered me a 1000$ grant.  I accepted but no longer wish to go to that college.  My friends said I can't back out of grants...I'm sure you can..what if there is an emergency?  Anyone know what I can do? . Of course you can! These things are almost always non-binding. In fact, most schools will cancel your financial aid automatically when they find out you're not attending.  \n\nIf the grant is a federal grant, the process will be taken care of for you, since one of the fundamental rules of financial aid administration is that you can't disburse funding for a student who isn't attending your school.  As I said, if you told your school that you aren't coming, chances are that they already cancelled your grant.\n\nIf the grant is from the school itself, chances are that the regulations are similar.  No school wants to throw their money away on a student who doesn't go to their school, so they will check and double-check to make sure that you are a student there before they disburse your grant funds.  If you are uncertain, just give them a call to confirm this.	Education & Reference

I don't ""hate"" Bush, I just think he's a bit thick . . . I felt he went about the Afghan and Iraq wars the wrong way.  It has just stirred up even more hatred towards the West - the Muslims who bombed London on 7/7/05 used Britains' involvement in these wars as an excuse, and this has led to a lot of bad feeling from Brits about the whole conflict and Blair getting involved with Bush's war.\n\nBut honestly, given the choice I side far more with America that I ever could with the Muslim Terrorists.  \n\nYes I grew up with Muslims in school etc (we all did over here) but I can't say I ever had any Muslim friends or have any sympathy for the radical cause.  I spent far more of my time around Hindus, many of whose parents had been driven out of North India by Muslim violence, plus I've had some really bad experiences with Muslims throughout my life, I feel far more trusting of Hindus than I ever will of a Muslim due to these experiences. \n\nSo I'm not one of those Brits who says ""I have Muslims friends and they are great"" or has any sympathy for their cause.  \n\nI was disgusted at 9/11 and canot accept any excuse for it.  I was even more horrified when it hit our own shores on 7/7 and the latest arrests of Muslims trying to blow up British people.

can someone tell me why people are interested in becoming bodyworks or yoga teachers? .  . I would love to be a yoga instructor, because yoga has become such an important part of my life.

what are the essential factors affecting the buffering capacity of a buffer solution? .  . Buffer capacity is defined as the moles of acid or base necessary to change the pH of one liter of solution by one unit.\n\nBuffer Capacity = (number of moles of OH- or H3O+ added)     divided by ( pH change) x (volume of buffer in L)\n\n-Buffering capacity increases as the molar concentration (molarity)of the buffer salt/acid solution increases.\nThat's only partially true.The pH of a buffer solution is independent of buffer concentration only if there is a sufficient quantity present. A buffer consists of a solution of a weak acid (base) and the salt of weak acid (base). The addition of either acid or base converts acid(base) to the acid (base) salt, or the salt back to acid (base) when another acid or base is added to the solution.If there is not enough buffer present compared to the added acid or base, the buffer can be swamped, and the pH will change significantly. So it is only partially true that the buffer is independent of the buffer concentration.If the amount of acid or base added, is small compared to the buffer concentration then the pH is not sensitive to the amount of buffer present\n\n-the closer the bufferd pH is to the pKa,the greater the buffering capacity\n\nThe solution is at a maximum buffer capacity (the minimum dpH/dn) when pH = pKa, as can be seen algebraically: \nKa = [H3O+][A-]/[HA]; [H3O+] = Ka[HA]/[A-] \n\nlog [H3O+] = log Ka + log ([HA]/[A-]) \n\npH = pKa - log([HA]/[A-]) \n\nThis rearranged form of the ionization constant of an acid is sometimes called the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation. \n\nSince pH = pKa if and only if [HA] = [A-], maximum buffer capacity of a conjugate acid-base pair is always found at pH = pKa. Reasonable buffer capacity is still obtained if the ratio of [HA] to [A-] is somewhere between 0.1 and 10, but outside this range it decreases rapidly. A chemical buffer can be effective about pH = pKa +/- 1. To make up a buffer solution one would first choose a reasonable acid-base conjugate pair on the basis of its pKa value and any other chemical constraints (one would not use the HCN/CN- pair, for example, in biological systems because cyanide is toxic). One would then adjust the concentrations such that both are reasonable (say 10-3 molar or above) while the desired pH is still obtained. The conjugate acid-base pairs glycinium ion/glycine, hydrogen citrate/citrate, dihydrogen phosphate/monohydrogen phosphate, and boric acid/hydrogen borate are often used for the preparation of aqueous buffers.

I would think that anything in the health field would be a good career move for Arizona, depending on where in Arizona you wanted to move. There are several areas that are ""active adult"" which means the majority of people in the area are over 55. Natually, people in this age group have a consistently higher need for medical care, including radiology. Most of these communities are close to either Tucson or Phoenix, so you don't necessarily have to live in a predominately older community to work there.

"Any person who has experienced astral projections, spiritual encounters or the like? . I want personal experiences and not hearsay evidences please.... . i regularly go astralling.  in fact, a lot of people do, whether or not they realize it in the waking world.  you see, people generally have two selves.. their physical self that houses their Waking Mind, and their Astral self.  your astral self often gets around in the astral realms, regardless of whether or not your waking mind realizes it.\n\nthere are many in the y-messenger chat rooms, religion and beliefs/paganism, that also have experience with astral projection.  i think you'll find some real-time q&a to be quite helpful.  however, it seems to be a phenomenon of the paganism rooms that the higher the number, the less people there are, and the more focused the topics.  you'll have to be patient, however.  for every month i spend on there, i maybe get a day's worth of applicable and serious conversation.  when it happens, however, it's GOOOOOOOOOOOD!\n\nas for personal experiences, i can give you a bit, but they are, indeed, quite personal...\n\ni lay down as if i'm going to sleep, and at that state between dreams and wakefullness, you'll find yourself in the perfect meditative state for astralling.  first, i Visualize (that's imagination with force and intent--sounds trite, but try it and you'll see what i mean) a ""dream vista"" of my choosing.  this can be whatever i wish.  as the vista becomes tangible to me, that is as i manifest unto it.  the FIRST thing i do is raise a shield around me as i sit and collect my thoughts.  to do that, again, Visualization.  in fact, i wouldn't go ANYWHERE in the astrals until you're MORE THAN COMFORTABLE with forming a vista and a shield.  as for the nature of yours, that is up to you.  :)  it is also up to you the form in which you manifest, but i suggest human, as it's what you know in this life.  don't get ahead of yourself!  :)\n\nwhen i feel i'm ready (don't rush it!) i stand up, stretch my legs, and decide where i want to go.  sometimes, it's certain spirit-energy-hubs.  these often manifest themselves in the mortal mind as tangible cities.  there's so many that i cannot list them all here.  after making sure no entity has any pressing business with me, i set off.  sometimes, instead of going to a public place, i'll try and find a few astral friends i've met over the years, and we find a nice secluded spot and chill.  once in a while, and i'm sure this happens to a lot of astrallers, i get attacked.  i'm sure some people find such scary, but you can get attacked in the physical realm, as well...  so you're really no safer here nor there.  i suggest dealing with astral attackers in a ""non-lethal"" manner (there's a reason that's in quotes), as sometimes entities have a big brother that they run back to for help...  get the picture?  hee hee!\n\nsometimes my spirits and i go and find old astral entities that we know of and ask their advice on certain topics.  sometimes we don our helmets and have a friendly sparring match, just for fun.  i want to make note that i'm not denoting ownership when i say ""my spirits"".  you can translate that as ""my friends"".. showing how we relate, not some vile master-slave relationship.\n\nsometimes the astralling continues long after my body has actually fallen asleep, yet the mind continues to be conscious of what goes on.  this is not always the case, however.  once in a while the astralling session just fades out and i rejoin my sleeping body.  sometimes, i continue the whole night through, and then the alarm clock goes off and interrupts me.  Sure, i have to go to work, but there's few things more irritating than having a particularly good astralling session interrupted by something so mundane.  \n\nthe next night, when i ""jack back in"", so to speak, i often find that my astral self is still continuting whatever it was that we left off with..  or even finished that up and then began a new task.\n\ni "	Society & Culture
"What is a good title for my essay I wrote on Othello, by William Shakespear? . Here is my first paragraph:\nIn Shakespeareâs Othello many themes are presented. The themes apply to the characters and important objects in the novel.

It is also illustrated in Iago in which he acts like a monster after finding out that Othello does not promote him. The fact that Othello and Iago have the tragic flaw of  jealousy, leads them to act like monsters, which in turn creates the ultimate tragedy. . For a title, I would pick a quote from Othello, and put it in quotes.\n\nFor example:\n""By your Gracious Patience"", Othello. Act i., Sc. 3\nor,\n""Every Puny Whipster"", Othello. Act v.

"when did boxing became legal? .  . I don't think it was ever really illegal to begin with.\n\nMaybe you're wondering when boxing became a sanctioned sport? Earliest evidence suggests that boxing was prevalent in North Africa during 4000 BC and the Mediterranean in 1500 BC. \n\nRecords of boxing activity disappeared after the fall of the Roman Empire. The sport would later resurface in English during the early 18th century in the form of bare-knuckle prizefighting. The first documented account of a bare-knuckle fight in England appeared in 1681 in the ""London Protestant Mercury,"" and the first English bare-knuckle champion was James Figg in 1719. This is also the time when the word ""boxing"" first came to be used.\n\nThe first boxing rules were introduced by heavyweight champion Jack Broughton in 1743 to protect fighters in the ring where deaths sometimes occurred. Under these rules, if a man went down and could not continue after a count of 30 seconds, the fight was over. Hitting a downed fighter and grasping below the waist were prohibited. Broughton also invented ""mufflers"" (padded gloves), which were used in training and exhibitions.\n\nIn 1867, the Marquess of Queensberry rules were drafted by John Chambers for amateur championships held at Lillie Bridge in London for Lightweights, Middleweights and Heavyweights. The rules were published under the patronage of the Marquess of Queensberry, whose name has always been associated with them."	Sports

i m as an international student here and i dont have enough money to pay my tution fee can i get my scholrship . i have paid my 40 % fee to may college but i dont have enought more fee to pay my tution fee so is there any way to get admission in my same college or to continue my study there coz i really want to study here its my dream to have a U.K degree its really my dream so please help me and support me . I'm afraid there isn't any scholarships/bursaries for International Students in the UK as the government (and the British people) don't want to fund non-UK citizens to study here. \n\nJust as if an English person wanted to study in (for example)Nigeria, the Nigerian government would not pay for his/her tuition fees.  \n\nBest thing to do is either see if the university is willing to let you have a year out in order for you to go home and make some money (getting a job in the UK isn't going to be an option, as you'll be on an education visa and will be deported if you try to work here full-time) and then come back with your fee money the following year.  Or you could apply to your embassy to see if there are any scholarship funds from your own country that would cover your education costs.\n\nYou can also gain a UK degree via Distance Learning, so if that is what you want, you can study for it in your own country, by post, email and online tutorials.

Water...I know it is good for me & I can lose lots of weight, but I can't stand it..any tips to swallow easier .  . Don't flavor it. Our bodies have specific taste buds in our throat that taste pure water. After a few days of drinking water, you will learn to appreciate that flavor. And as other answerers said, the temperature of the water will make a difference. Some people like it ice-cold, some like it tepid. If you want to buy water to get the purest, some brands you might like are Dansani and Pellegrino, they have some natural minerals in them, which make them taste both pure and flavorful.	Health

"What is the importance of the bill of rights? . What is the importance of the Bill of Rights?  Why was it added to the Constitution of the United States? . I think it was James Madison's wife (may have been Abigail Adams) who suggested that the Constitution said a lot about the organization of the government, but did nothing to specifically protect people, so then he went on a mad tear to construct some of those ""inalienable rights"" aforementioned.  But he didn't just make them up.  At least one of the Amendments was based on the constitution of the Virginia colony. \n\nThe importance of the Bill of Rights is to address what the state can and can't do to individuals.  Most of the Constitution divides up powers and provides checks and balances, but the Bill of Rights specifically protects people from the bad habits of government."	Politics & Government

I'm aware of only the Villagetronic VTBook PCMCIA graphics card. You can get info at the link below.\n\nOne way to improve your laptop's display performance is to increase the laptop's memory. Since most laptops use shared memory, increasing the general purpose memory increases the display memory. (When I went from 512 MB to 1 GB on my Toshiba laptop, the video memory went from 64 MB to 128 MB. I know because I checked.) This will give you a little better display performance.\n\nGood luck!

Should I call or not what do you think I should do? (Seriously....)? . I just found out today that my Sister and Mom (whom I haven't talked to in at least a year) have been calling my in laws to leave messages for me to call them, but the whole reason why I don't stay in touch with them is because first of all my Sister who is a known drug addict who has been addicted to meth for at least 10 years, she has done all sorts of kinds of things to not make me want to associate with her for example she has used my idententy for everything from phone bills to medical bills. My mom is another story, she does nothing to help my sister except enable her to be an addict. She still assocaites which my Ex husband who abused me, phsyically, mental and emotionally for seven years and claims that she doesn't even though I have proof. Well all in a nut shell they are just plain dysfunctional and negative and I feel my life is so much better without them ... but should I call them so they don't bother my in laws anymore with the phone calls? How should I go about this? . If it really bothers you that much that you are family is bothering your in laws, then call them up. Find out what they want and tell them to stop contacting you through them. There are better ways of communications in future. If anything tell them to try your email that way you have control of their contact and they certainly wont bother your in laws.	Family & Relationships

"What is Data Abstraction? . In regards to programming . It is considered one of the important concepts of the OOP. Data Abstraction is to see what is needed and leave what is not. It enables designers to focus the immediate goals and don't care about the details.\n\n When you are unemployed and looking for a job you might not be wondering all the conditions of a particular job ad. But when you went an interview you broaden your view like asking the salary or working conditions, or the projects that are waiting. But nobody places all the details of the job to a newspaper advertisement. The job advertisement can be considered as an abstraction or unemployed person's point of view for finding a job might be...\n\nThere can be different implemntations of thiss concept in programming, like the ""abstract"" keyword in Java or C#. When you are declaring a method (a class' member function), if you put aan ""abstract"" keyword in front of it, you mustn't declare its body, the only thing you declare is its signature. When a class derives from the one that is containing the abstract method that deriving class must declare the body of abstract method.\n\nBy doing this, you would say ok I must have a nice method like this but I don't know the actual implementation of this method, so I'd rather leave it to you (the deriving class)...\n\nIt is also a useful tool for generalization..."

"What Is More Important In Football....????????? . Should i work and weight lift on my hamstring and Quad for football next year *it starts in June... or my chest and arms??? i play defensive tackle by the way . As a former trainer of many college football players, you must first take into account your eating before you take into account your workout. You need to take in 6 meals a day. This may mean that you eat every 2-3 hours of small, healthy, and well balanced meals. These meals should include a balance of carbs and protein. Eggs (egg whites), chicken, LEAN meat ( i emphasize lean because fatty meats can get you winded), and greens (spinach and other legumes). Secondly, stop eating by 7pm, so your body can process your foods and during your sleep your body can build muscle. Now the work out. As a defensive tackle, i suggest as off season training to rotate your routine from day to day. Do not spend two consecutive days working on the same muscle area. Best combination is 3-4 day a week routine that has day one doing biceps and triceps, day two shoulders and chest, and day three ""super legs"". Super legs is basically a coined term that means you blast the shit out of your leg muscles. Quads, calfs, hams...etc...\nBe mindful of working in about 15 min of cardio either before or after. THats a simple routine and you should see some results. Your weight is the issue you gotta worry about now. Eat eat eat!!!! Hope that helps and best of luck to you."	Sports

When is the best time for a man to ask a woman about getting married? . how long is too long a period for courtship? should it be after 6months, a year? when should a couple think about getting married? . courtship in the united states doesn't really happen because people quickly get into a relationship as fast as they can get out of them. [ are you filipino??? coz if you are i can tell you stories about it ]. well, there's really no exact date for having too long of a courtship because a relationship will happen on its own. as for thinking about marriage, when both individuals have the same strong feelings for the other person and are serious then that too will be set by the couple. marriage should be thought about when thinking of a long-term relationship and when they know its for the rest of their lives. both should be commited and faithful with each other.

Is Depression a true illness or can it be attributed  only to spirituality difficulties? . My daughter is on medicine for depression but her husband argues that she doesn't need the medicine. That her true problem is spiritually-related. I am trying to make him understand it's a chemical imbalance, but having no luck. Any suggestions on how to make someone understand the complexity of depression? . Wow, your husband is only going to do some pretty ruff damage to your daughter's condition. He is in no way helping her by refusing to accept facts about it being a true illness. One that is not from lack of spirituality. By saying she is lacking in spirituality, he is putting blame on her for being ill. That will only mess up her mental health even more. Talk to your daughter's doctor and let the doctor know what is going on with your husband's beliefs about this. The doctor needs to know this so he can help your daughter with the fall out/effects of your husband's attitude about this. By the way: tell your husband that I am an ordained minister and shame on him for using /God/Jesus/the holy spirit this way!	Health

"characteristics of the hotel industry? .  . Well...I've been a Night Manager at a hotel for a bit over five years. So I definitely consider myself an insider. Okay...as with any aspect of the hospitality/service industry, it is a lot different behind the scenes than it is out front. Often you will find hotels are understaffed, underpaid and underfunded. And I'm not being critical -you'll most likely find that to be the norm anywhere, from the grandest five star to the sleaziest motel. Generally the owners invest, but they don't want to spend anymore than they have to. I have quite a few acquaintances in the biz; we often compare notes and this is pretty much the standard. It's amazing how many hotel owners and accountants are unfamiliar with that old maxim, ""It takes money to make money"", because they always seem to be whinging about how business could be better but they don't want to invest the money into making the improvements. Catch 22. Beyond that, housekeeping is the most thankless job in a hotel. Housekeepers see a lot; they also have to clean up some unholy messes and usually don't get even a thank you. Mind you, you'll also find some guests are big tippers, but these are more often than not the exception to the rule. Hotel employees in general see a lot, as you can imagine; you get all sorts of people as guests, and a lot tends to go on up in those rooms. And again that rule applies across the board. \nAs a five year veteran of the business, it never ceases to amaze me how many guests blatantly try to insult the intelligence of the front desk agents. People will try ANYTHING to get a deal, refund or a comp. People will lay any kind of story on you they can to get a room so they can carry out all sorts of illegal activities. I've personally been bribed to rent to unsavoury kinds of people so many times...but I can't be bought. Mind you, at our particular establishment we take security pretty seriously, and, as the night guy, that most often comes down to me.\nI know, a lot of what I've said must sound like I'm awfully jaded and cynical, but it's true. Don't get me wrong, I love my job (otherwise I wouldn't be doing it) but working in the hotel industry can be pretty thankless. But I believe in giving travellers good, inexpensive decent quality accommodation; that's why I'm here. However, the reality of the hotel industry is that though most hotels claim a ""100% Satisfaction Guarantee"", on a good day they can maybe manage 70%. A lot of it comes down to the bean counters though, and unfortunately they can be notoriously tight with the bucks when they want to be. Trouble is, this is most often when the hotel needs the bucks the most (renovations, advertising, etc...)\nI wish your question was a bit more specific...get a hold of me if you need more (specfic) details..."

There are a ton of great places in CA, so, it will depend on where you live, how far you want to go and what your skill level is.\n\nUp north... \n- The Upper Sacramento (above Lake Shasta) has about 40 miles of river available with a good, strong population of rainbows.\n- The McCloud is one of the most beautiful rivers you'll find anywhere.\n- The Pit has tough wading and fiesty bows.\n- Hat Creek/Fall River are both spring creeks that offer a good challenge.\n- Lower Sacramento in and below Redding has some of the largest trout in the state, but a boat is often required to fish it (especially at high flows).\n- N. Fork of the Feather has some great water.\n\nfurther south you still have a pick of rivers, but they tend to be a little shorter either in fishable water or season... Putah Creek, Merced, the Stan, Calaveras.\n\nTahoe has the Truckee and tons and tons of little creeks.\n\nFurther South you have fewer and fewer options... although you do have the Kings, Ownes, Hot Creek and Piru Creek... just to mention the few that spring to mind.\n\nCA has a TON of water and finding the right spot for your style is all part of the fun.  Be sure to check the regulations for whatever water you select, as they can vary dramatically.\n\nThe main season doesn't start until the last Sat. in April and the rivers are likely to be pretty high with all the rain and snow we've had.

how do I start a dog breeding business? .  . I could tell you a lot about but I wonât since a dog breeding âbusinessâ is a puppy mill operation.  This is neither in the best interest of dogs nor is it best for one who is buying the dog from such an operation.  \n\nDuring the last 14,000 to 15,000 years people have bred dogs to better the breed or to create new breeds to fill a need.  Real breeders do not get into this for the money.  \n\nOn top of the ethics of such a proposition, there is the investment which includes not only the dogs (buying the best you can get) but the pre-breeding medical testing, and the medical work post breeding.  Then there are the things that can go wrong (such as caesarian births) and the cost associated with them.  \n\nThere are far better businesses to get into with a much better chance at profit.

PROCEDURE:\n\n1) Plot the so-called vertices.\n2) Connect any two adjacent points with a segment.\n3) Determine if the resulting plane figure is a rectangle.\n(It seems that the vertices that you have mentioned do not form a rectangle.)\nNote: A rectangle is a quadrilateral with opposite sides being parallel and interior angles all being right angles.\n4) Connect opposite vertices with a line segment. You will form two diagonals.\n5) determine the equation of each line (segment) that constitute the diagonal. You will have two equations.\n6) Find the point of intersection between the two diagonals by solving for the unknowns (x & y) using the two equations.\n7) Find the length of each diagonal (the two diagonals should have the same length).\n8) Find the length from a vertex to the point of intersection between the two diagonals.\n9) If the length from any vertex to the point of intersection between the diagonals is half that of the length of any diagonal, then the diagonals are said to bisect each other.

Physics Question? . In the movie Terminator, Arnold Schwarzenegger lifts someone up by the neck and, with both arms fully extended and horizontal, holds the person off the ground. If the person being held weighs 650 N, is 60 cm from the shoulder joint, and Arnold has an anatomy analogous to that in the figure below, what force must each of the deltoid muscles exert to perform this task? \n[Hint: The weight of the arm is 30.0 N and its center of gravity is at the elbow joint, 27.5 cm from the shoulder joint.] \n____ kN . .203kN?\n\nThe weight of the person produced a torque about the shoulder joint that is roughly 60cm, neglecting the width of the person. So the moment arm is 60cm and the angle is 90 degrees. There is also a torque about the shoulder joint from the weight of the arms. The moment arm here is 27.5 cm and is also at an angle of 90 degrees. So adding up both of these torques will give you the total force that Arnie has to exert to hold the person up. Dividing by two, since he has two deltoids, will give the force from each deltoid.\n\nT = (F1 * m1 * + F2 * m2) * sin(theta)\n\nwith F = 650N, m1 = .60m and F2 = 2(30N), m2 = .275m and theta = 0\n\nT = (650N*.6m + 60N*.275m)*sin(90)\n= 407N\n\nSo half this is 203N = .203kN	Science & Mathematics

The PSP can not only play games with extreme graphics. It can also hold music, (depending on which memory stick duo you have, the 4 GB Sandisk is the biggest one for it.), play music videos and favorite TV Shows Awards Performances and many more. You can also purchase movie made in the Universal Media Disc format. There are many titles out and more soon to come. And that's not it. You can even export your favorites photos of Family & Friends onto your portable and store as a background. If thought that was something listen to this, you can also browse the internet using Wireless Wi-Fi connection running through your home or in you local area. You can check e-mails and even stream music for the unpopular RSS Feeds. If you haven't tried the PSP out go get out and buy one, you will not regret it. HEY! CHECK OUT THAT LINK TOO!

What were your experiences in increasing dosage of effexor to higher than 75 mg?  My doc may? . be raising my dosage or switching my med. I have been on 75 mg for 10 months and it has helped with some anxiety for a while but I am still depressed and have lately started to get real anxious/ panicky again. I also sleep alot and feel really fatigued. I'm wondering whether an increase in effexor xr would help or make it worse or if I should try to get him to put me on something else. What have been your experiences? . These are questions only your Dr. can answer properly, however, if I were in your shoes, I would do some research on the different meds available for what you're experiencing.\n\nThere are mainly 3 neurotransmitters involved in treating depression, where one of the three needs to be regulated about 80% of the time to fix you.  They are neuropinephrine, dopamine and serotonin.  Effexor is a multiple reuptake inhibitor, which effects the reuptake of two neurotransmitters, namely dopamine and neuropinephrine.  At this point, if it's not making you feel better after 10 months 1) You're not targeting the right neurotransmitter (you may need to switch to a serotonin reuptake inhibitor like lexepro) or 2) The reuptake in Effexor is not working for you, which is not uncommon and you may need to switch to another MRI like Cymbalta or Wellbutrin.  \n\nThe constant fatigue is a normal side effect for Effexor, however, you should get past it in 2 weeks to a month.  If it's come back 10 months into taking it, chances are it stopped working.  Again, this is common for reuptake inhibitors.\n\nFrom what I've researched, Effexor is the hardest antidpressant to get off of.  75mg is a very small dosage, where you can take up to 375mg/day.  It may be a good idea to quit now and try something else.  The discontinuation dosage is 35mg per week; so if you increase the dosage and it still doesn't work, it will take you longer to get off of it.  However, you may need a stronger dose, based on what you discussed, but that is for you and your Dr. to decide.\n\nThese are just all theories, based on some research I've done on antidepressants - I always research drugs before I take them, based on my diagnosis.  At this point,  you haven't described your diagnosis, aside from depression and anxiety.  In most cases a simple SSRI combined with a theraputic does of a benzodiazepine (Ativan, Xanax, Klonopin) usually do the trick.  If you have Unipolar/Bipolar, schitzoafective, BPD, it's a whole nother ball game.\n\nI hope this helps and good luck.	Health

can anyone tell me who won on Vengence? . Can anyone tell me how the matches went like a short summary? Did DX beat the Spirit Squad? . Triple threat-Nitro, Carlito, Shelton Benjamin-- Carlito did the work and wore Shelton out Nitro took advantage of it and won by pinning Shelton.\n\nMasked Kane beat Kane with a chokeslam.\n\nRic Flair beat Mick Foley-once by pinfall and the next because Foley got out a trash can and was disqualified. Foley then beat the crap out of Flair with the can and then the barb wire bat to Flair's head, chest, and arms.\n\nUmaga beat up Eugene, Hacksaw(Jim Dugan), Doink(The Clown), and AEE(the annoying manager) made Umaga leave before he beat up Samala.    \n\nWell fought battle between Cena and Sabu ended with Cena forcing Sabu to  tap out.\n\nEdge and RVD.   RVD took it after Edge trying to cheat backfired and gave RVD the advantage.\n\nOrton vs. Angle.   Orton manged the RKO and won the match.\n\nDX vs. Spirit squad.   DX dominated and eventually annihilated Spirit Squad.  Then stuck one of the cheerleader guys face into HHH bare butt.\n\nBackstage- RVD challenged Cena to a title match tomorrow night on RAW.\n\nEnd of show- Vince came out and told DX- I'll see you two tomorrow night.\n\nMight not be in exact order but those are the results.

In fact he used to pray for strength & safety to both of them fighters before the bout begins. That's the prayer of Manny once he stepped in to the ring. Not like other bigheaded boxers keep on talking than doing into the spotlight. And for other's info. Philippines had Elorde, Navarette, Espinosa, Penalosa etc. former world champions who received also a big support from their fellow countrymen. And ofcourse Manny is famous in their country but they don't have only him.

"Ok youll dont like me but i have alots of smouches for all youll beautiful ladies out there so there holla one .  . I would ask you to define ""smouches,"" but I'm afraid you might try.\n\nNevermind.  I found it:\n\nSMOUCH\nCounterfeit tea.\nWhen tea first arrived in Britain from China in the 1660s it was extremely expensive, made much more so in the following century by customs duties which greatly encouraged smuggling. Its high price was a stimulus also to counterfeiters, who made imitation teas out of the dried leaves of hawthorn, ash, sloe and other native British plants. These were coloured with various noxious substances, such as verdigris and copperas, and sold to dealers under the slang name of smouch (more formally and euphemistically, British tea). So pervasive was this practice (one estimate is that three million pounds weight were being made each year at one point) that Parliament passed an Act in 1725 condemning it, not only because it cheated the Revenue but because it resulted in the âdestruction of great quantities of timber, woods and underwoodsâ. The source of the word is unknown, though it was also current in the same period as a dialect term for a kiss (hence the modern smooch), and as an offensive slang term for a Jew, and later turns up in the US as a verb meaning âto acquire dishonestly; to pilferâ (for example, in Huckleberry Finn: âSo Iâll mosey along now, and smouch a couple of case-knivesâ)."

what kind of lisence do you need to install survillance equitment? .  . I doubt any definite license is needed for this. Low voltage wiring, in my state, requires no license so cable, sound systems, computer networks and so forth do not need some specific license. \n\nIf you're going to be dealing with electrical supplies and not just audio/video cables, then it would be good to have an electrician's license whether it is absolutely necessary or not.\n\nIf you're doing this as a business, a business license seems like a good idea, as well as incorporation and a DBA and insurance.\n\nI would want anyone doing security work to be bonded as well. If you're planning on working for someone else, just be bond-able. Clear up anything that would keep you from passing a background check.	Business & Finance

Why don't like 13-15 yr old guys like chubby girls? . I live in a small town (our school is tiny...only like 52 kids in our entire grade and like 600 ppl in k-12 at our school) so obviously there arent that many guys. Any guys who are hot/cute are jerks and you'd get majorly picked on if you went out with a not-so-hot guy. Well even though our school is small we have some GORGEOUS girls. I mean im one of the prettiest girls in our grade, or so all the girls think, but im chubby so the guys dont like me. I know that guys are immature at this age,or any other age, but that doesn't make me stop wanting a bf. The average weight of girls in my grade is like 125 and under and they're really pretty. They are my friends and they're awesome, but sometimes i get jealous that the guys like them so much, but not me. How can I get a hot bf over these gorgeous girls? HELP!!! . I know how you feel.

Who Invented the teleporter? .  . Well I was going to say that The Great Bird of the Galaxy Gene Roddenberry himself created it as a means to move the story along quickly. He knew that if he had to spend time moving his characters up and down from ship to planet in a shuttle, it would slow down the pace of the episode. So he invented the transporter so that he could quickly get the characters involved in action before the first commercial break, and before the viewers became bored and switched channels to see what else was on.\n\nHowever now that I think about it, I realize that STAR TREK was the first to use it on a regular basis, but Gene Roddenberry did not invent it.\n\nThe first use of it I can find was by Ralph Milne Farley in THE RADIO MAN in 1924, then Norman Matson's DOCTOR FOGG in 1929. Alfred Bester's story THE STARS MY DESTINATION in 1956 talks about how transporters transformed a society. Then of course came George Langelaan's THE FLY in 1957 and Gordon R Dickson's TIME TO TELEPORT in 1960\n\nSince then it has been in a ton of sci-fi books and movies, and is pretty much a part of sci-fi as space ships and aliens are.\n\nother than that, you know it really doesn't exist right?

"Why are ""The 10 Commandments"" CALLED ""The 10 Commandments""? . B""H\nPLEASE READ BEFORE YOU ANSWER!!!\n\nI had to delete this question last time b/c people weren't answering the question I asked.  Yes, GD gave us His holy commandments; that is NOT my question.\n\nIn the Bible's original Hebrew, the ""10 Commandments"" are called ""Eseret ha-Dibrot"".\n\nEseret = 10\nha = the\nDibrot = Words/Statements (Mitzvot = Commandments)\n\nEseret haDibrot were never inteneded to be ABOVE all other commandments.  There are, however, 7 Noahide Commandments that are considered UNIVERSAL.\n\nThe 7 Noahide Cokmmandments are: DO NOT worship idols; DO NOT curse GD; DO NOT murder; DO NOT commit acts of sexual immorality; DO NOT steal; ESTABLISH a judicial system; DO NOT eat meat cut off while the animal was still alive.\n\nWhat ever happened to the Laws of Noah (so named b/c the 7th was given after The Flood - before that, no meat was permitted)?\n\nWhen and why did ""The 10 Commandmens"" start getting called that? . Because Christianity founded itself on the Septuagint (Greek Bible) and later the Vulgate (latin) rather than the Hebrew originals.\n\nThe Septuagint word used in Exodus 20:6 is ""prostagma"" (Greek for ""orders"".) In the Vulgate, the word used is ""praecepta"" for precepts. \n\nSo because of this, there is definitely a slightly different emphasis in Christian understanding. We don't really consider ourselves wrong to use these texts, as they're actually older (by several centuries) than the Masoretic Hebrew used for modern Torah scrolls. They do offer a valid insight into how the texts were interpreted and thought of in ancient times."	Society & Culture

does brownciteuis go away on its own or do you have to be treated? .  . Bronchitis is inflammation of the tubes that carry air to the lungs (bronchial tubes). When these tubes are inflamed, they swell and produce mucus (sputum). The swollen tubes and increased mucus trigger coughing and may make it more difficult for you to breathe. There are two types of bronchitis:\n\nAcute bronchitis usually develops rapidly and lasts 2 to 3 weeks in otherwise healthy people. Most healthy people who develop bronchitis get better without any complications Chronic bronchitis recurs and becomes long-term, especially in people who smoke. A cough that produces too much mucus and is present most days during a 3-month period for at least 2 years in a row suggests chronic bronchitis. Chronic bronchitis is a form of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). \nThis topic focuses on acute bronchitis. It affects both children and adults.\n \n\nWhat causes acute bronchitis? \n\nAcute bronchitis is usually caused by a virus. It is more common during the winter months, and you often develop it after having an upper respiratory tract illness such as influenza (flu) or a cold. Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) may be a cause, especially in adults older than 65. Acute bronchitis is caused by bacteria about 10% of the time. 1 \n\nAcute bronchitis can also be caused by exposure to smoke, chemicals, or air pollution, all of which can irritate the bronchial tubes, or it can develop from accidentally inhaling (aspirating) food, vomit, or mucous material.\n\nWhat are the symptoms? \n\nThe main symptom of acute bronchitis is a cough that often brings up clear, yellow, or green mucus. A mild fever, usually less than 101Â° (38.3Â°), may also be present. You may feel tired and short of breath, and you may wheeze when breathing. Symptoms usually begin 3 to 4 days after an upper respiratory tract infection and last 2 to 3 weeks in otherwise healthy people. However, more than 20% of people with acute bronchitis have a cough that lasts more than 4 weeks. 2 \n\nHow is acute bronchitis diagnosed? \n\nDiagnosis of acute bronchitis is usually based on your medical history and a physical examination. Your health professional will make sure you do not have pneumonia or risk factors for more serious diseases, such as COPD, that may affect treatment. Although more testing, such as a chest X-ray, is usually not necessary, it may be done in infants and adults older than 65.\n\nHow is it treated? \n\nTreatment for acute bronchitis in otherwise healthy people usually includes taking steps to reduce cough, fever, and pain. You can relieve your cough by drinking plenty of fluids and using cough drops and other nonprescription medications. You can reduce fever and pain by using nonprescription pain relievers. Prescription medications, such as antibiotics, generally are not beneficial. If you have a heart or lung disease, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), heart failure, or asthma, evaluation and treatment may be more extensive	Health

How America became super power? .  . (m)\n\nThe historical view: By Allan Little\n\n \n\nGet ready to be shocked. Prepare yourself to be awestruck. For shock and awe are what the United States military say they hope to achieve in the opening minutes of the coming campaign against Iraq.\n\nIt will â if it goes to plan â be a war like none the world has ever seen. Washington is about to test drive the early prototype model of a military juggernaut that will be so powerful that it will eventually make any talk of âmilitary balanceâ redundant, even laughable.\n\n\nIn Washington, where the talk is all of âpower projectionâ, a new ideological conviction is taking shape. It is being driven by technological advance. Technology, increasingly, is shaping what America can do, how America defines itself, and how it engages with the rest of us by providing the means to impose its will through sheer force of arms anywhere in the world where it feels US interests are threatened. \n\n\nThe sheer scale of American supremacy is written in the numbers: the US military is larger than the next ten national forces combined. Its annual budget is 400 billion dollars. It has five hundred bases. And still this is not enough. The Defence Secretary Donald Rumsfeld is planning such sweeping changes in the military that they amount not to radical reform, not even to a revolution â but to transformation. \n\n\nâWhat weâve got now is a kind of third age of the American military,â says Michael Clark, âa globalised military that can now do pretty much anything it wants. And weâre also seeing the development of a political ideology which backs up that military dominance. And thatâs a pretty uncomfortable situation for the rest of us to be in. For the rest of the world itâs rather like being in a bath with an elephant â no matter how sensitive the elephant tries to be, the rest of us in the bathtub are going to feel pretty uncomfortable.â\n\n\nWashingtonâs current impatience with its reluctant allies emerged first in the seventy-eight day air campaign NATO fought in Kosovo four years ago. Many of the allies were squeamish to begin with about going to war at all. France intervened to impose political restrictions on what the military could do, to declare some targets â not matter how militarily legitimate â politically unacceptable. Many senior US generals came away from that experience feeling bruised. General Mike Short, who commanded the air campaign from Italy, told me âI never fought a war by committee before â I donât want to have to do it ever againâ. \n\n\nThe talk now shifted from formal coalitions of partners bound by Treaty, towards informal short lived partnerships of expediency â so-called âcoalitions of the willingâ. \n\n\nThat impulse toward unilateralism only reflects what is happening technologically. America is entering a new age of hi tech weaponry â of precision bombing, of lazar guided missiles, of aircraft dropping bombs in the Gulf, while the pilot sits a thousand miles away or more â possibly even in the Pentagon and going home to his wife and kids in a Washington suburb at the end of his dayâs remote controlled combat. \n\n\nI asked a US Air Force General about the transforming power of pilot-less aircraft. And it brought me a swift ticking off. âThey wonât be pilot-less. Theyâll have a pilot. He just wonât be in the planeâ.\n\n\nâThe accuracy with which modern aircraft can attack their targets is astonishingâ, says the military historian John Keegan. âThey can at last do what they always said they could do. They always said they could hit a target from 10,000 feet and it actually wasnât true â they were always missing. There was a very high inaccuracy factor â there isnât any longer. Weapons are so accurate â nowadays when an aircraft wishes to hit a target it does hit it.â\n\n\nThere is a battlefield National Park on the outskirts of Washington DC at a place called Manassas.

"Why do you like Prison Break? Why is it so famous? . as an English teacher, I'd like to work on Prison Break with my students who are fascinated by the show, so give me your opinion and do not hesitate to write why you like or don't like this tv drama...Thank you . The show is total crap, per real inmates and real cops.   But like Miami Vice in my era, it was entertainment.\n\nMy husband has been in federal prison for 26 years, so I know what real prison is like.   My problem with the show is that it glamourizes prison to young people, making prison trendy, whereas prison is really hell on earth. \n\nThe show gets a lot of press, and I'm dismayed to see youthful commentary like ""Oh wow, Brittany, he is like so cool, ya know?""  ""Ohmigod, Tiff, he is hot.   Should I get a tatto like that, I mean, really, it would be so cool to have barb wire around my arm!""  During a recent shopping expedition, I saw that Old Navy now carries a line of women's shirts that have prisoner's numbers on them.   By all means, let's wear numbers and pretend we are prisoners, because prison is so cool...\n\nI saw a young man on a 4-year drug charge die after being gang-raped at a prison that had one doctor for 2000 inmates.    I knew an elderly diabetic man who died in his wheelchair outside the medical unit waiting for assistance.   If you have a heart attack in a federal prison, you are dead.   You get up when they tell you, you eat when they tell you, you go outside if they let you, you go to bed when they tell you, you travel between units only when or if they let you.\n\nThey might hold your mail for two weeks before releasing it, making you miss an important court deadline.  They held a man's parole hearing in a storage room in their medical unit.  During visitation, sometimes your wife has to drag your screaming daughter or son out of your arms when it's time to say goodbye.   In my husband's case, I was not able to go tell him in person that our oldest son had died.   I had to tell him via a phone call.   Despite raising the money for a federal marshall's escort, he was still not allowed to attend the funeral.\n\nTHAT is reality in prison.   And along with millions of families of prisoners who live like this, THAT is why I can't stand the show."	Entertainment & Music

If today were your last day and you knew it, would you behave well?  Why? . It is not a rhetorical question.  Why would you (not) behave well?  If today were your last day what would you do?  Is there a common tendency for good behaviours since we believe there's life (any kind) after death? . Yes, because of Karma.  Whenever you do good, it will come back to you threefold.  The same holds true for when you do bad.  This follows you from life to life.  So it is always in your best interest to do good.  One does not cancel out the other.  So if you do someone bad, and then do something good, they will not cancel each other out.  It will prolong how many times you will need to return.	Family & Relationships

"anyone remember your past lives? .  . It is not unusual for people to remember past lives while under hypnosis.  I was once fascinated by such books as ""The Search for the Girl with the Blue Eyes"" (Stearn) and ""Audrey Murphy (Bernstein),"" where Ruth Simmons was placed into a hypnotic state to recall past lives.\n\nMy sister was once part of an age-regression experiment and recalled that her name was ""Helga,"" married to a man named ""Hans"" and died in an avalanche.  The session was recorded and played back to her after the experiment.  She was particularly shocked at her accent and detailed knowledge of an earlier life in a foreign country.\n\nAfter many years of searching, I believe I have found the answer.  At least it has satisfied my deepest concern and curiosity:\n\nWhile I have no hard proof, I am absolutely convinced that these detailed accounts are ""remembered"" by the spirits (or demons, if you will) that previously have inhabited these various individuals.  People only live once but spirits have the ability to exist throughout many generations of the human lifespan and can be summoned under hypnosis to recall their previous hosts.\n\nIt is a rather disconcerting thought to realize that my sister (an atheist) harbors one of these entities.\n\nJohnny"	Society & Culture

I know the distance is far, but I figured, in this day and age, this would be easy to do? . Since the maximum range of WiFi is around 300 feet (and effectively much less with walls, interference etc) no - you won't be able to connect to your router back at home.  Keep in mind that office complexes that are simply trying to get a signal between 2 floors or across the street, often have to use range expanders or repeaters, and that's a fraction of the distance you're talking about.\n\nYou might get a signal from some next-door neighbor to your relatives, or you'd have to consider a different type of broadband service (similar to cellular coverage)	Computers & Internet

Does anyone go to Penn University? . I have the dream and goal of going to Penn. I am a freshman in High School so I have a while, but I know its never to soon to start with college. Does anyone have any helpful hints of what I should do to reach my goal of going to Penn? THANKS! . I taught at the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania for three years.\n\nIt is good that you are thinking about what you want to do now.  To get into Penn, you will have to graduate at the top of your class, be active in extracurricular activities, have good recommendations and high SAT scores.\n\nIf you are able to do all of this, then you can probably get into Penn.  If you try, and don't quite do well enough (e.g., you don't have great SATs or have the good SATs but didn't do well in a couple of classes) then Penn is a stretch -- but there are other good schools that will take you.\n\nEven if you are good enough to get into Penn, there is a chance that you may not get in.  Your chances go up if you choose the right college within Penn.  For example, Wharton is much more competitive than the College of Arts.\n\nGood luck.	Education & Reference

"Is there any alternative/solution to this- some people can't eat/swallow medicine? . some people have problems swallowing/ eating medicine tablets or pills (regardless of the size, shape or taste). is there any solution that can replace this worse problem? everytime, they tend to vomit when they try to eat or swallow tablets or pills. can't the same medicine(intially in solid form) be injected into the patient's body through injection in liquid form? (i wonder)\nTHIS IS SOMEONE'S SERIOUS PROBLEM. SINCERE HELP IS APPRECIATED. \npractical and affordable solutions most welcome.\nTHANK YOU. . One practical thing to try now is to grind the pills and mix them into food or something drinkable.  Hopefully that would cover the texture and taste enough so they could tolerate it.  Try it first without telling the patient, so as to eliminate any psychosomatic reaction.  If they're still vomiting, then they have an intolerance to the medication itself, and you'll need to call the doctor to prescribe something else.\n\nMany medications are available in ""elixir"" form, which is basically the same thing as above, only the laboratory does it.  Can the person you're talking about handle stuff like cough syrup?\n\nNot so practical or affordable are injectable (subcutaneous) versions of the medications.  Not all medications are available in injectable form; they're expensive, and they have to be injected intravenously (which requires skill and training) or intramsucularly (which hurts).\n\nThere is a new kind of insulin product which is inhaled, though they're not sure yet what if any harm this could cause the respiratory system.  I doubt there are very many medications which are available as inhalants (other than those to treat respiratory ailments, of course).\n\nThen, of course, there are patches.  Again, not all medications are available in patch form.\n\nI think the most practical solution would be mixing it into food/drink.  Check with your doctor to see what he thinks, since it depends a lot on the medication.  Antibiotics, for example, usually shouldn't be taken with food; and there are some medications which cannot be taken with grapefruit juice, of all things.  But maybe there are elixir versions available that your doctor can prescribe.  Good luck."	Science & Mathematics
how can a male have long moment of sex without ejaculation? .  .

I read about a guy who used a whole bunch of digitalis to numb his pee-pee and almost had a coronary because of it. There's also a constricting plastic ring that you put around the base of the shaft for more control, but that has risks too. Getting real good and drunk before the deed can both help and hurt.

Under the Electoral College system......................? . . Under the Electoral College system, can we end up with a president from one ticket and a vice president from another ticket?\nthnx . It's conceivably possible.  Suppose there's a close race and the winning ticket gets, say, 270 electoral votes and the loser get 268.  In such a case, it would only take 2 faithless electors to vote for the losing party's VP nominee over their own in order to get a VP from the other party.  While some states have laws requiring electors to vote for who they're pledged to, not all do so it could happen.\n\nLikewise, in the above example, if those 2 electors were to vote for someone else, so that neither of the 2 VP candidates received a majority of the votes, then the Senate would get to decide which of them (or that random guy that the faithless electors voted for) would get to be Vice-President.  This scenario is probably more likely: imagine that the winning party's VP nominee had some scandal come out about him: some electors might still be required to vote for him, because of the faithless elector laws I noted above, while others would choose not to, and thus failing to give any candidate the majority.

Why do we have to have so much pity for Israel? . I mean here are a group of people who INSISTED after WW2 on being given their own state, and the world said ok, where? And they said - The Holy Land! Right sandwiched in the middle of everyone that hates them, that will bomb them, and steals the land from the surrounding people. What a surprise that people there want to kill them.\n\nThey knew all this going in -- So can someone please explain to me why we have to protect them? Why do we care what happens to them when they INSISTED that they be put there themselves?\n\nIts kind of like people that go rockclimbing and then get lost or hurt.. Dumb@ss you went up there, get yourself down. . Well- guess your knowledge of history is ehavily influenced by those propaganda sites you read- up until 1973 the USA provided Israel with VERY FEW arms, in fact most of Israel's arsenal was bought from Europe or self built.  Even today with weaponry they purchase- they often strip the elctronics out and replace them with their own, superior versions.  A case in point was with the bombing of the Iranian nuclear reactor in the eighties- American airforce generals were flabbergasted at the performance of the Israeli F16s since the American ones were not capable of the same level of performance.\n\nAnd guess what- the drive for a state in the are started in the late 19th century- it was just that it was finally succesful after WWII.  And hey- guess what,Jews liberated from the concentration camps, and trying to return to their homes- were often attacked by their former neighbors.\n\nSo wehere would you have put a Jewsih state?  In Africa where it would have started a whole colnial issue?  In South America where they would not have been welcomed/  IN Europe where they had just seen their friends and family murdered?  In the end- Israel with their millenia long connection to it was the only option.\n\nAs for the UN partition plan- it gave countries to both Israel and the Palestinans.  Israel accepted the plan, but the Arab league decided to make sure their would be no Jewish state- and five countries attacked Israel as the state was proclaimed.  And Israel was victorous- the ARabs lost, and the Palestinians were the big losers- with their Arab brethren stealing their land- and forcing them into refugee camps.  And lets not forget- the estimate of Palestinan refugees was 400-600 thousand- the estinated number of Jewish refugees from Arab countries 800 thousand-1 million.\n\nWhat happened to the Jewish refugees- they were absorbed by the state, made full citizens and helped to establish themselv es after having all their money and possessions stolen by the Arab governments- unlike the Palestinian refugees who were deprived of their rights, denied citizenship in the countreies of those occupying them (Egypt of Jordan), and left to starve - until the UN started a special agency just to deal with their problem!

What is the Wendigo? .  . Yeah, as one story tells it, there was an inuit woman who had a child and a husband. On one particularly cold winter, her husband was injured and couldn't hunt. her baby cried in the night. Over the next week or two, she got hungrier and hungrier, until one night she had a dream, she dreamt that she had caught a rabbit and skinned it and put it into a soup, and upon waking found herself with the pot already boiling with the great smelling soup. so she ate the soup and grew strong, then she went to feed some to her child, but the child was missing, she thought for a moment and realized that she could not have caught a rabbit in her sleep. the shock hit her, but hunger overrode it. she ate till she was full and warm. She quickly fed her husband who was delerious with fever, he looked up and asked where she got the food from, a tear formed in her eye and he knew, he refused to eat it, and cursed her actions. in only a few more days without food, the wife was hungry again, and so she ate what was left of her old life, and now is cursed to continue eating. She knows only  hunger, and only human flesh can fufil the need, but not for long.\n\nIn another version she has the dream and then CHOOSES to cook the baby rather than let her husband die, but when he refuses to eat she is enraged and chilled to the very heart.

"Will rapid glaciar movement cause it to completely slide into the ocean in one catastrophic event? . After watching ""NOVA"" last night on PBS about global warming and the incredible increase in glaciar movement due to melt water deep below the glacier ( between the glacier and solid rock ), will this glacier completely slide into the ocean in one event and cause a tsunami of hundres of feet high and posibly circle the globe?\n\nAre government leaders in the U.S. aware of this posibility and thair's a conspiracy to hide the truth from the public?\n\nIs it too late to do anything about it?\n\nIs the U.S.A. to blame for what will happen to our planet?\n\nIs this event the next ""MASS EXTINCTION""?\n\nSo many question, so little answers... . You can rest easy on this one.\n\nNo, an entire glacier will not slip off into the ocean all at once causing a massive global tsunami that wipes out the entire world.\n\nFor one thing, a glacier is a very large collection of ice, which usually has a collection of impurities, such as rocks, plants, frozen mamoths, and such inside it.  These objects inside the glacier have a different structural strength and flexibility than the ice, so the ice tends to crack around them.\n\nEven if the glacier were pure ice, ice only has so much rigidity, and as it grinds it's way toward the sea through the winding valley it inhabits, the glacier will naturally break up into chunks of various sizes.\n\nAs the glacier nears the coast line, these different chunks begin to break off, forming ice burgs of different sizes.  This naturally limits the size of any one ice burg, and that in turn limits the possible tsunami scale waves to rather small splashes.  In fact, to get bigger ice burgs, the part where the ice enters the water must be closer to the same height, so a splash from a very big ice burg would instead be a small ripple as it goes down a much shorter distance in falling into the sea.\n\nYou could go through some complicated equations to figure out just how big a piece of ice could possibly fall into the ocean at any one time, and how far it would fall to figure out just how big a wave it could make, and then determine how far such a wave could propagate before it died out like ripples in a pond, but the basic fact is that no ice burg could cause a massive tidal wave.\n\nPresumably, if the water under the glacier melted really fast, the entire glacier might fall into the ocean, forming many, many small splashes as each piece broke and fell, but again, water is not a perfect lubricant, and this will limit the rate at which they fall, which will prevent a single catastrophic tidal wave, although under certain circumstances, the ice burgs might fall in a pattern that produced very choppy water that ships wouldn't be able to sail in... but again, not on a global scale.\n\nAre government leaders in the US aware of this posibility? NO!  government leaders are barely even aware of how to get themselves re-elected.\n\nIs it too late to do anything about it?  Umm, no.  We could build enormous mirrors in various parts of the world to reflect more sunlight back into space, which should reduce the effects of global warming to some extent.  That, along with using jets to produce global dimming, and changing to less polluting equippment to reduce greenhouse gasses might keep the ice burgs from falling too fast to make choppy water.\n\nIs the USA to blame for what will happen to our planet? of course.  With a population of less than half that of China or india, and much cleaner resources we are obviously the major polluters in the world. \n\nIs this event the next ""Mass Extinction?""  only for fish that get in the way of the falling ice bergs."

"Many Gods Vs. One True God? . In Christianity, we have the Holy trinity, or three aspects of God, in Hinduism there are many aspect's of God- symbolized as different Deity. In Jewish Mysticism there are 72 names of God. Couldn't these all be different ways of expressing something so huge- it's hard to put into words- the true totality of God. People negate these other expressions of the Divine as blasphemism- because they state that ""they"" worship many. I believe it is a misinterpretation- that the ""many"" are just aspects of the one Supreme God, and that even Christians have their own way of expressing this Truth with the Trinity . I agree. I think deities are metaphors for something too immense, infinite, and eternal for the human mind to understand. It's a way of trying to comprehend the incomprehensible, to define the indefinable. And think the more we define it, the further we get from the truth."	Society & Culture

Why can't you tickle yourself? .  . Much of the explanation for this question is still unknown, but research has shown that the brain is trained to know what to feel when a person moves or performs any function. We aren't aware of a lot of the sensations generated by our movements. For example, you probably don't pay much attention to your vocal cords when you speak. For the same reason, we can't tickle ourselves. If we grab our sides in an attempt to tickle ourselves, our brain anticipates this contact from the hands and prepares itself for it. By taking away the feeling of unease and panic, the body no longer responds the same as it would if someone else were to tickle us.	Business & Finance

normally, we can't get MAC address of a remote computer(outside of the LAN),right? .  . This is true.  MAC Addressing is at Layer 2, and MAC addresses control how one packet gets to the next piece of hardware, the next hop.\n\nFor instance, when a router receives a packet, it determines the next hop based on it's IP lookup table for the destination IP.  It then writes the MAC address of the next hop into the packet's destination address, puts it's own MAC address in the packet's source address, and then submits the whole new packet out on the correct interface.\n\nOf course this implies Ethernet type network is used from source to destination, when many different network types could have been used on the way.

Many foreign countries believe the 1st US Moon Landing was contrived for US ends. Could this be possible? . Moon Landing . Nope.... As part of the moon landing, the astronauts left a reflector dish on the moon which was used by observatories to calculate the exact distance to the moon (down to a fraction of an inch). They fired a laser beam at it and calculated the time taken for the beam to be reflected back to Earth, thereby allowing scientists to calculate the distance to the moon. If there was no moon landing then who left the reflector ?\n\nIn July 2006 a joint Japanese/European satellite will be launched to map the surface of the moon. Part of the plan is to beam back pictures of the equipment left behind on the moon, such as the lunar lander and scoot-about buggy.

My E string snapped on my guitar. How do I replace it? . My high E string snapped and I have no idea how to replaceit, I need a through how-to! . 1) Take the old string off.  Sometimes there is a peg that holds the string in on the body of the guitar.  If this is the case, you may need to find something to pull the peg out.  Be careful not to use something that will scratch the wood.  Unwind the rest of the string from the capstan on the neck.\n2) I assume you have a new string to replace it with.  Put the string in the slot in the body first.  Slip the other end of the string through the hole in the capstan.  Be sure to leave enough string so that the capstan will have enough to grab when you wind it.  In other words, don't pull the string tight before you wind it. Leave some slack.\n3)Hold the string in place above the capstan and start winding.  It helps to have one of those winders as it makes the job so much faster.  If you don't keep winding.\n4)Don't let the string slip over the top of the capstan.\n5)As the string tightens pull up on it to make it seat better.\n6)Don't over tighten.  I've broken a few strings this way.  As the string starts to get tight pluck it to see if it is getting close to where it needs to be.\n7)You may want to clip off the excess after you are finished.  It makes the guitar look neater.\n8)Be prepared for the string to stretch after a minute or two. You will have to keep tuning it until it gets fully stretched.  It may keep doing this to a lesser degree over a matter of days.\n\nLet me know if you need more specific details.	Entertainment & Music

So, is that i didnÂ´t get the Chlamydia even after sex?? or His or mine results are wrong?? or what else can that be?? . hey hun, as weird as this is, i'm going through the EXACTLY same problem! my bf and i went on a break, and we both met other people, then we got back together, and I was noticing some weird stuff about my body, and get checked, and he did too just in case, he had Chlamydia and I had some Fungus infection.

"Christians / Muslims: Is it ok to smoke when you are praying? First thought here? . I mean, what is wrong with breaking out the butts and firing one up when praying? Would this offend a god needy of worship?\n\nI think the answers I get here will most likely demonstrate why religion is a dividing and negative force in our lives.\n\nThe ""holy scrolls"" are so contradictory, that they leave open almost ANY question, allowing the person coming up with such a answer from ""faith"" and review of the ""good books"" to actually use his or her own opinion, and then impose this opinion on others, sometimes by force of law ... in the name of a perfect and all-powerful god ...... as if they were children again, threatening others with being beaten up by their big brother.  PLEASE answer with your first thought, the above question? . My first thought is No. \n\nI also agree with what you said later. However, I also believe that part of the beauty of religion is that the scared texts ARE so open to interpretation. What divides us is not that the openness, but rather that we forget how different each one of us can interpret the text. If God wanted us all to follow things so strictly, all the sacred texts would just be a list of commandments."	Society & Culture
"Cheating/Many Lies = Beyound Repair? . Ok, constructive comments only please - certain level of maturity required :) this is long.\n\nIn short, been having problems with my live-in B/F of 4.5 yrs. I want to preface this with the fact that outside this issue all else is peachy and we match really well/have a great time/always together/similar minded/connected, etc. \n\nAbout a year ago, I found out that since we were together, he'd spend some  time on myspace (hi5, friendster, name it) and had like 133 friends/chicks on it (mostly 18-20 yr olds); which all of them he claimed he never met. Of course, no mention of me or being in a LTR in his profiles.\n\nLater I found out he asked at least one girl for lunch (she didn't jump though), and brought at least two home on different occasions (my b/f took like 200 of naked (not the artistic kind either) pics of them, but yet says he  didn't hook up with either one. There was also a few of weird emails like replying to Craisglsit NSA type personals, etc, over a course of 4 years (he used to work from home before so if anything went on before 7pm, I wouldn't know). \n\nThis totally bugged me and we fought over it (i.e, I'd cry and he'd get ticked off and say ""it's nothing"", etc). \n\nTired of such crap, I left for a short vacation (alone), to clear my head, have some fun, nothing more. And that I did; met a bunch of people including some guy I kept in touch via phone/email for about 2 weeks after my trip. Nothing happened, just some flirty conversations (which was wrong on my part, but I am vindictive). I know I was wrong to even go that far.\n \nMy B/F was furious though (apparently, what was OK for him to do, was not for me) when he saw the emails, we had a falling out; made up, I stopped communication with this dude, etc. \n\nShortly after though, I emailed spoke with this 18 yr old chick he went after on myspace, and brought home for the so-called ""photoshoot"" (the last one happened 3 months ago) while I was away. She said he tried to ""do""\nher after a lap dance she gave, and they had a fight over that, the end. \n\nI confront him - no drama, mind you - I'm too shocked to even cry, just calmly tell him I want out of this sh*t ASAP. He swears and begs and cries for a few hrs and makes me stay. Obviously, all his profiles come down and he promises not to ever pull any remotely similar stunts. Conveniently, at that time - he buys me the ring and we're consumed with it for a while. (He never wanted to hear about marriage or this type of stuff before). The ring goes back (we saw a better style) and he decided to postpone the purchase, which is fine with me. He is starting a new business and our *next step* is just not a priority (nor do I think it will ever be, in fairness partly due to stuff beyond his control). \n\nYet, somehow we work things out (or so it seemed), and we did have a great month together. \n\nI thought I put this sh*t behind us, or rather tried to tell myself I did. Obviously not. I can't seem to get past it. Am I crazy for even trying?? Is it even possible considering our history? Yet again, there has been so many great times... I don't want to bring this up again to my b/f as he'd just probably get mad.\n\nAll that from a guy who says he loves me, and I do believe that, as he treats me so well and even lets me drive his car :) I do love him also (seriously). I'm not a prude, I can understand attraction and flirting (which he also has no problem doing in front of me), but maybe this is a bit much. \n\nHe is a good father (the man is 40, I'm 31) to his 2 teen live-away kids from prior marriage, a hard worker and a very responsible, smart, educated, articulate, charming guy. Everybody loves him, including my parents. So it's not like I ask for advice from people I know.\n\nHere is my question; obviously he lied before, but is there any chance he may be telling the truth when he says he won't cheat/do any weird crap to . remember one thing LOVE ONLY GOES SO FAR.love can only do so much,don't let it repair what is broken and cant be fixed.if he is a type of person that hides things from you then what will he hide when you are married?I'm a guy and yes i fuck up but I know what hurts the person I love,I don't want a payback from her either because that sucks.I don't know what to tell you don't let no one make your mind up on what to do,and don't let love make the choice either,because will only take you so far....hope i helped"	Family & Relationships

One of the effects of having the F/A-22 Raptor Fighter/Bomber is the pilot can devote more energy to fighting instead of gaining situational awareness.

If I'm 25 and I only make 40k a year,How should I start my financial portfolio? .  . All the above answers are good, but I would say it depends..\nWhat are you saving for?  Retirement?  A house?  Vacation?\nBefore wasting your time with a financial planner you really have to decide what your portfolio will be used for.  If it's retirement, by all means use your 401(k) if your employer matches any amount (it's free money and an immediate return on your investment).  If a 401(k) is not available, by all means look at a Roth IRA.  After 5 years your returns are not taxable.  Use the Motley Fool (www.motleyfool.com) for advice.  For long term investment, go with a mutual fund that follows the S&P 500.  I didn't, I was in large caps and mid-caps and haven't made the long term returns that Vanguard 500 returned (over the past 15 years).  Real estate, especially your own home, is a good idea so that it will be paid for before you retire.  Don't overspend yourself on real estate by buying more than you can afford.  Again, figure out what you are saving for and then make a plan based upon what you will need the money for in the future.  Bear in mind when you will need the money as well.  Mutual funds are good for long term (10-15 years+), but if you will need the money in a shorter term (say five years or less) and need for ALL of your original savings to be there, stick with money funds.  They pay more than savings accounts and generally won't lose principal the way your standard mutual funds, or even real estate, could.	Business & Finance

"Purpose of Professional Coaches? . What purpose to professional coaches serve? I look at it from this perspective; all the athletes are ""professional"" meaning they are playing at a level that is beyond what the amateur sportsman does. So wouldnt it stand to reason that these athletes can executes plays without the assistance of a coach? It would seem they do not need direction and guidance because they are ""professionals"". Comments? . Its a theory but you still have a goal of getting a group of individuals to play together as a cohesive group.  That's what his job is, to get all his players on the same page working for the same goal. It may sound easy but when your talking about ( usually) millionaire men in their 20's and 30's with egos that have been fed since they were in junior high it is difficult to get them to put aside their own personal good and focus on whats good for the team. That is the skill that the coach has, its not teaching at that level its more directing and delegating.  You would think that since they are grown adults that they wouldn't need supervision or a ""Coach"" in the context that you put it but at that level the things the Coach does is so much more.  He can watch the game from a view point of how is the team doing where as an individual player is more focused on how he or she is doing also they usually have more experience in the sport than the players they are coaching and from that experience they can guide them into situations and prepare them for situations that they have never experienced. Also history has shown great coaches can get more out of players than regular coaches.  A great coach can push a player to be better than he is."	Sports
Please explain Lean Manufacturing? .  . Lean Manufacturing is a business initiative to reduce waste in manufactured products. The basic idea is to reduce the cost systematically, throughout the product and production process, by means of a series of process reviews.\nThe crucial insight is that most costs are assigned when a product is designed. Often an engineer will specify familiar, safe materials and processes rather than inexpensive, efficient ones. This reduces project risk, that is, the cost to the engineer, while increasing financial risks, and decreasing profits. Good organizations develop and review checklists to review product designs.

I'd like quick and simple answers to these chemistry questions please. Read on...? . 1. Liquids generally have lower density compared to their solid state. Then why does ice float on water?\n\n2. Why does an air cooler cool better on a hot, dry day?\n\nPlease answer the above keeping in ming that my school follows the 9th standard CBSE portions and that I have a science exam tomorrow.\n\nThe answers to these two in the previous question didn't seem too clear. . I'm not sure about the CBSE, but I'll try explaining it anyway.\n\n1. \nWater is a pretty special substance because it expands upon freezing. (Which is why you can't freeze it in an enclosed bottle or it will crack.) This means that for the same mass, the volume is more.\n\nDensity = mass / volume, thus when your mass is constant and the volume increases, the density decreases. This is why ice floats on water, because water has a higher density than ice.\n\n\n2. \nFirst I'll explain the hot part. On a hot day, the temperature difference between the air and the desired temperature is much greater than on a cooler day. Generally, heat is transferred at a much higher rate if the temperature difference is great. Thus, the air cooler can cool the air quickly by since the heat can travel from the air to the coolant at a high rate.\n\nAir has a lower specific heat capacity than water. This means to say that for the same mass of air and water, the air requires less energy to raise its temperature by 1K. It means that for the same amount of energy supplied, the air can be cooled/warmed faster than water.\n\nOn a dry day, there isn't as much water vapour as on a humid day, thus the air cools more quickly.

I bought 2 new build properties last year & bought new conservatories for both. Can I claim back the VAT paid? . I made sure I completed the purchase of teh conservatories before completion of the build of the properties. . I'm guessing from your username and that you're referring to VAT that you're in the UK, the following relates to VAT legislation in the UK...\n\nThe only way you can claim VAT back is if you are a VAT registered business.  If for example, you bought the houses as part of your trade (property developer, investor etc) then you can register for VAT.  If you're in business and your turnover exceeds Â£61,000 in the current tax year then you have no choice but to register for VAT.  The major drawback to being VAT registered is that you have to charge VAT on all Vatable goods and services which means a 17.5% hike in your prices.\n\nThere are some exceptions but I doubt they'd apply in your case - import and export, charitable and educational establishments etc.\n\nAs a private individual it's a case of having to pay VAT and not being able to reclaim it.\n\nThere are ways and means of getting round some things such as becoming a company yourself and selling the assets to a third party (spouse, child, parent etc).  You'd need to speak to an accountant to get the best advice on this.	Business & Finance

How can I get him to notice me again? . maybe he is just not interested in you. you cant make someone like you or show interest. i would just move on and find someone else to concentrate on and who has time for me.

how can i analyze political speeches linguistically? . i want to know how can i use small corpus discourse to analyze political speeches linguistically . It is called a discourse analysis or critical textual analysis and it is complex issue. Many universities have a courses on it, so it is not so easy to give a couple of advices. However, the principle you can start with is to analyze sentence by sentence, word by word. First of all you need to define notions used in some speech like nation, democracy, freedom, collateral damage etc. Try to find their real meaning and compare its using in a concrete speech. You will be surprised how their meanings vary dependently of context they are used in and how authors manipulate with them. Good luck!	Politics & Government

"To JEWISH Please. A friendly question? . In no way i meant in bad intentions. What does theseâ \n\nBabylonian Talmud, Tractate Niddah 44b\nSoncino 1961 Edition, page 309\n\nmeans to you? . What does it mean?  It's a page from the Talmud, as published by the Soncino Press in 1961, from the Tractate called Niddah, the second side of the 44th page.\n\nOn the page, there's a verse explaining, in purely technical terms, at what age an act of intercourse can constitute a betrothal.  This is because sex is one of the ways through which a marriage is made official.  It was never the preferred method, however, and in fact, it was made punishable by rabbinic decree.\n\nYou have to understand that what is being described in that passage is an explanation as to at what age, intercourse is physically possible.  This is purely an explanation so that one can understand the legal implications of such an act.  It is not the same as saying whether such an act is PERMISSIBLE, and in fact, it is strictly forbidden.\n\n""A friendly question?""\n\nI'm not sure, but I kind of have my doubts.  Who spends their time digging through the Talmud for this sort of thing?  And you'll forgive me for guessing that you didn't actually find this by reading the Talmud itself - you would have been reading for a long time before stumbling upon this passage.  On the other hand, this sort of citation (along with other mistranslations, and in some cases, passages that simply don't exist in the Talmud) can be found on all kinds of White Power and Neo-Nazi websites.  Furthermore, if you had actually been studying the Talmud, you probably would have found commentaries and other passages that would have answered your question (including exhortations for a father not to marry off his daughter until she becomes mature and can give her consent).  So might I be so bold as to inquire as to where you found this citation?  You give no context for your question at all.  It looks like you simply expect somebody to look at it and start drawing conclusions about Judaism (which would invariably be false if the reader glances at the page, in translation, casually, and doesn't understand Talmudic methodology, or the context in which this passage occurs).\n\nFor more on this subject, and anti-Semitic Talmud libels in general, see here:\n\nhttp://www.geocities.com/fightinghate/OnThatLieMarryingMinor.html\n\nhere: http://www.angelfire.com/mt/talmud/three.html\n\nand here: http://www.geocities.com/fightinghate/Talmud"	Society & Culture

anyone know anything about hart's concept of law? .  . H.L.A. Hartâs The Concept of Law (1961) is an analysis of the relation between law, coercion, and morality, and is an attempt to clarify the question of whether all laws may be properly conceptualized as coercive orders or as moral commands. Hart argues that there is no logically necessary connection between law and coercion or between law and morality. He explains that to classify all laws as coercive orders or as moral commands is to oversimplify the relation between law, coercion, and morality. He also explains that to conceptualize all laws as coercive orders or as moral commands is to impose a misleading appearance of uniformity on different kinds of laws and on different kinds of social functions which laws may perform. He argues that to describe all laws as coercive orders is to mischaracterize the purpose and function of some laws and is to misunderstand their content, mode of origin, and range of application.\n\nHart explains that laws are rules which may forbid individuals to perform various kinds of actions, or which may impose various obligations on individuals, or which may require individuals to undergo punishment for injuring other individuals, or which may specify how contracts are to be arranged, or which may specify how official documents are to be created, or which may specify how legislatures are to be assembled, or which may specify how courts are to function, or which may determine how new laws are to be enacted, or which may determine how old laws are to be changed. Laws may exert coercive power over individuals by imposing penalties on those individuals who do not comply with various kinds of duties or obligations. However, not all laws may be regarded as coercive orders, because some laws may confer powers or privileges on individuals without imposing duties or obligations on them.\n\nHart criticizes the concept of law which is formulated by John Austin in The Province of Jurisprudence Determined (1832) and which proposes that all laws are commands of a legally unlimited sovereign. Austin contends that all laws are coercive orders which impose duties or obligations on individuals. Hart explains, however, that laws may differ from the commands of a sovereign, in that they may apply to those individuals who enact them and not merely to other individuals. Laws may also differ from coercive orders in that they may not necessarily impose duties or obligations but may instead confer powers or privileges.\n\nHart describes laws which impose duties or obligations on individuals as 'primary rules of obligation.' In order for a system of primary rules to function effectively, secondary rules may be necessary in order to provide an authoritative statement of all the primary rules. Secondary rules may also be necessary in order to allow legislators to make changes in the primary rules if the primary rules are found to be defective or inadequate. Secondary rules may also be necessary in order to enable courts to resolve disputes over the interpretation and application of the primary rules. The secondary rules of a legal system may thus include 'rules of recognition,' 'rules of change,' and 'rules of adjudication.'\n\nIn order for the primary rules of a legal system to function effectively, the rules must be sufficiently clear and intelligible to be understood by those individuals to whom they apply. If the primary rules are not sufficiently clear or intelligible, then there may be uncertainty about the obligations which have been imposed on individuals. Vagueness or ambiguity in the secondary rules of a legal system may also cause uncertainty as to whether powers have been conferred on individuals in accordance with statutory requirements or may cause uncertainty as to whether legislators have the authority to change laws. Vagueness or ambiguity in the secondary rules of a legal system may also cause uncertainty as to whether courts have jurisdiction over disputes concerning the in	Education & Reference

where are emerald found? how is emerlad procude or gotten? is emerald rare or abundant? . its a aboout a birthstone and its name is emerald. . Emerald (Be3Al2SiO6) is a variety of the mineral beryl, Chemically, it is a beryllium-aluminum silicate whose color is due to small quantities of chromium compounds.\n\n It is highly prized as a gemstone and by weight is the most valuable gemstone in the world. Emerald is regarded as the traditional birthstone for May. According to legend, the emerald has the power to protect the chastity of the wearer and to ward off evil spirits.  \n\nThe emerald was highly esteemed in antiquity; the stones were used for ornaments in early Egypt where some of the first emeralds were mined. The finest emeralds are found in South America in Colombia, where they have been mined for over 400 years.   Colombia is the preeminent exporter of emeralds in the world.\n\nIndia, Zimbabwe, and Australia are minor sources of the natural stones. Synthetic emeralds are also manufactured in Germany, France, and the United States.\n\nEmerald is a rare and valuable gemstone and, as such, provided the incentive for developing synthetic emeralds. Both hydrothermal and flux-growth synthetics have been produced and a method has been developed for producing an emerald overgrowth on colorless beryl. Synthetic emeralds fluoresce a dull red with long wave UV light due to an indicator added during the process of synthesizing the emerald, whereas natural specimens do not	Education & Reference

"How do you ask a girl for a date? .  . Wow. This one's hard to give a specific answer to.

Another thing is that you have to be indifferent to the outcome of the situation because this too will affect how you ask a girl out.\n\nNow the how to. When you ask a girl out, don't make it sound like you are asking her out. Make it sound more like you are going somewhere and ask her if she would like to join you.\n\nexample :\n""Hi, ________. Listen, I'm going to go ________. You can join me if you like.""\n(first blank is the name)\n(second blank is the place you want to go)-starbucks is good.\n\nIf you do that, the girl will feel comfortable because you are not pressuring her to go with you.

"what happens if a cow doesnt get milked everyday? does a cow have to be milked everyday? . i was wondering why ? i know that are milked several times a day. but why. will the milk go bad or dry up? . Cows, like all mammals,produce milk to feed their young.  We take advantage of this when we milk a cow.   The milk supply produced depends on the demand for it.   If a calf- or the farmer, take less milk, then less is produced to replace it.  After a while, the cow's body quits producing milk all together, and she ""dries up"" in farmer language.  Now if you have a cow in milk production, you milk her twice a day, every day, 7 days a week.  At each milking, you try to remove all the milk from the udder.  If you do not milk her, she will get extremely uncomfortable, full and irritable.  Some will leak out, and eventually her body would absorb the excess.  In the meantime, she would be at risk to develop infections and abcesses of the udder, and could even die from them.  If she does develop an abcess, milk production in that quadrant (cows have four separate sections in the udder, and four teats, fyi) will stop.   It may also not produce milk in that quadrant ever again, and will always be at risk for developing another abcess if she does.  A good farmer would never let this happen.  He would gradually reduce the amount of milk taken from a cow over a period of weeks until there was very little produced.  A cow naturally dries up milk supply before another calf is born, at which point she ""freshens"" and begins supplying milk again."	Science & Mathematics

what is meant by visual studio and what is meant by visual basic.what are its uses? .  . Visual studio was the first programming suite that I am aware of. I'm sure somebody did it first and others were in writing when Visual studio came out. The concept was to include a full programmers platform into one application. That way you could write code in multiple languages, work with databases and check help references all from the same editor. \n\nThe result was basically an editor that was not real well suited to any of the langues. The VB editor was tossed in and never really integrated with Visual Studio. The C++ editor was a major downgrade from the previous C++ editor in my opinion and J++ was a flop that nobody used in the real world. \n\nOther changes were made which added unecessary dependancies to projects and hindered development. The database explorer was buggy, had little support for anything but SQL Server and nobody really used it. So what it became was really the new VC++ IDE as most VB and Foxpro programmers skipped the rest of the installation and only installed the editor for languages they actually used. \n\nThe Visual studio concept saw real integration when it became .net as all of the languages are almost the same language now. I guess that was one way to solve the language learning curve. That is make EVERYBODY learn a new one :) \n\nWhat it is used for today is writing apps that run only on the newest Microsoft operating systems. You cannot write software which competes with major Microsoft products either. Visual studio itself is no longer supported. .net studio I think is what they call the new one.\n\nVisual Basic is a programming language. Probably the most popular during it's heyday. It was one of the first visual stateless languages. The syntax supported core Basic syntax but added a GUI builder on top of this and support for windows programming. It was still an interpeted language. To run VB executables you had to distribute a run time lib with it. Today it is unsupported. I suggest using Gambas instead. It is far closer to VB than .net VB is.	Computers & Internet

"Was Jesus a real person or a mythical figure modeled after previous ""God-men"" figures? . Evidence seems to point to the fact that Jesus was a mythological figure patterned after earlier ""God-men"" figures that were prevalent in pagan Mystery Religions such as Dionysus, Adonis, Osiris, etc.  Is there any concrete evidence to support the actual existence of the man described in the Bible known as Jesus besides second hand and heresay accounts of church apologists decades after Jesus supposedly lived? . I'd say he was a Jewish rabbi who may have claimed to be the messiah, and (if he was married) had many followers.  Many other Jews have also claimed to be the messiah, but when they died and there was no peace on earth, their followers conceded that he was not the great leader that prophesy declared would lead the people to peace on earth.\nHe was elevated to the status of God at the time of the Nicene Creed (4th century).  The Roman Catholic Church exterminated all ""heretics"" who didn't believe he was God.  The Eastern Orthodox Church accepted many other creeds and allowed them to continue side by side, much as the Roman Catholic Church has reluctantly done with Protestants many centuries later.\nSo, yes he was a ""real"" person elevated to the status of God after three centuries.  No concrete ""evidence"" other than that it was very common to follow great leaders who called themselves the messiah."	Society & Culture

Even if they believed in God and loved God, people before Jesus' time couldn't believe Jesus, which according to Christianity, is the most important thing required to be with God in heaven. The Old Testament did say a savior was going to come though, right? . Before Jesus came, people were bound by the law and the keeping of the law. In other words, if you believed in God, you kept the law, did your sacrifices to God, did what God said, etc., you went to Heaven. But the lawmakers of the time were so mean, they made it where no one could keep the law. They asked ridlculous things of the people.So Jesus came, to make obeying attainable. Once Jesus came, he was crucified for the sins of the world. On the 3rd day he rose, then ascended into Heaven, where he sits at the right hand of the Father, God. Now, all you have to do is believe that Jesus died, rose again, confess your sins to him and ask for forgiveness, and you will go to Heaven. So, the people before Jesus came that did what they were asked of God to do are in Heaven.	Society & Culture

Who besides me are sick and freakin' tired of these TAKS tests? Is there anything we can do about them? . My daughter does not do well on tests like these. And they say she has to pass them to go to the next grade even though she passes all of her classes. How stupid is that? . Many people don't understand that a student may be cognizant of and understand the concepts s/he's expected to know, but be unable to test well due to a variety of factors.  Standardized tests don't typically measure a student's ability to apply knowledge, only the ability to memorize facts.  Students with better memorization skills do better on standardized tests.  Our current political and social culture, however, understandably seeks a certain level of accountability for both schools and students.  Unfortunately, standardized testing isn't necessarily a good measure of how bright or knowledgeable a student is, or how good of a job a school or teacher is doing; instead, it encourages teachers to teach to the test rather than teach students to apply critical thinking skills.  No one, however, has yet to come up with an alternative standard of measurement that can be applied equitably, and I doubt anyone ever will.  Instead, we need to recognize that every child has his/her own learning style and pace, to educate teachers to recognize students who are struggling or falling behind, and to give them the time and the resources to teach all of the children in their care to the best of their abilities.

Bipolar disorder? . If someone is 42 and has bipolar disorder, is on medication, will they get worse.Does this desease progress or what.Sorry do not know how long they have been on meds . Once you get put on meds and they are regulated, usually the bi-polar stays pretty even. You have to deal with it for the rest of your life, but as long as you stay on your meds and take the right amount, all you generally need is an adjustement every now and again. The person won't usually get worse unless they just stop meds all of a sudden, and the disorder really doesn't progress any farther than it is when the person is diagnosed and starts treatment.

Since the motion distance is 1/4 then the force produced will be four time the input force\nF1/F2=A1/A2(F is force and A is area)\n A1/A2 = pi 2 * 2 / pi r * r\n & F1/F2 = 1/4\n4/r^2=1/4\nr = 4 cm.\n\nTherefore dia. of secondary cylinder = 4*2 cm = 8cm.

How is possible for light to pass through the glass of bulbs or other materials, and why not other materials? . I know light acts as a wave when traveling in vacum and as a particle when hitting an object, but what makes some materials be able to let light through? . Each material absorbs different wavelengths of light. It turns out that glass an air absorb very little in the visual range of the spectrum (although they absorb in other regions). However, they do absorb some. If you had a piece of ordinary glass that was very thick, it wouldn't pass much light. In fact, one reason that mountains in a distance look blue is that the longer wavelengths are absorbed by the air. On the other hand, it is possible to have pices of metal that are so thin that they pass light.	Science & Mathematics

This is totally normal if it is before your period (a lot of women have PMS swelling), or if your breasts are currently growing.  Sore breasts may also be a sign of pregnancy, so keep that in mind if it's a possibility.  Breast cancer, in the early statges, does not hurt at all.

"I need help winning my girl back? . hey my name is Garrett Daum and I was dating this girl for one year and 1 month and she is the girl of my dreams, however im in college now and shes still in highschool and we are now 3 hrs away but i still saw her like every 2 weeks. then one day she tells me shes been hanging out with this guy but thes just a friend and i let that go. 5 days later shes wants to go on break and im an all or nothing type of guy but i allowed it cuz i lover her so much, then he asks her out and shes currently dating him but she promises me im the one she loves and just wants to experience having a boyfriend in her own highschool. I promised I 'd wait for her but i know shes doing stuff with him and shes starting to talk to some othwer guy too. All we do now is fight cuz i constantly ask when are you taking me back? even her family says it was tupid to let me go cuz her family loves me...How can I win her back I cant live without her shes my everything...please help . As long as you're  begging (and that's what it is - begging!) her to take you back, she knows she can do whatever she wants, and she'll still have you to go back to......  IF nothing else works out for her.  From what you've written, it sounds as though you're a very worthwhile guy - someone that lots of young women would just LOVE to have a relationship with - well, the smart ones, anyway.  Keep in mind, your ex is in high school, and very young.  (t's probably hard on her to not have a date on Friday night when all her friends do.)  Also, she might have a few ""wild oats to sow"" before she's ready to settle down with one guy....  But, know what?  You're young, too.  Why not take this ""break-up"" time as an opportunity to meet some other girls - maybe,someone in one of  your classes. (At least, you'll have something in common to talk about.) Get involved in some of the extra-cirricular activities around your campus.  You know, something that you're really interested in.  You' ll probably  find plenty of women who are interested in the same things. (Right now, you're building  your whole world around ONE person, which isn't wise in the long run.)  You might just find out that  you CAN live without your ex - or, if nothing else, you will learn a lot about how to handle yourself around women. (Begging them to come back to you is not the way, sweetie. It just makes you seem desperate.)  I know this is very, very difficult advise to take.  You might be homesick, and wishing things could be the way they used to be.  For many, the first year of college is hard to adapt to, but adapting is one of the most important lessons you can learn in life.  There's a big world out there - lot's of things to see, places to go, and people to meet.  It's sad if you choose to cling to the past  at such a young age.  And, you never know, your ex might just notice how mature and interesting you're becoming, and decide that those high school ""boys"" aren't  so ""all-that"" after all. That's when she might start begging you to take her back - that is, IF you'll still have her!  Think about it - and, best of luck to you.\n\nPEACE"	Family & Relationships

Ok then, one at a time\n\nwhy are the wires in a plug covered in flexible plastic? - its insulation to stop the individual strands of wire touching each other and causing a short circuit.\n\nwhy is brass used to make the pins in the plug? - 2 reasons, its a very good conductor of electricity and its very strong and resilient to being put in and taken out of the spring loaded metal strips that contact it in a plug.\n\nwhy is the earth pin longer than the others? - its a safety thing, the earth pin goes in first and you cant insert anything into the other two holes until it has - its to stop kids frying themselves if they shove stuff into the holes.\n\nwhy is thick cable used for some appliances and thin for others? - depends upon the amount of current it'll be carrying, a cable for an adaptor for a USB external drive say is thin because it uses a small amount of current, but your electric cooker uses tons, the wire has to be thicker to carry the amount of amperage travelling through it so that it doesn't overheat.\n\nwhat is the purpose of a fuse? - its in case of a power surge, it will blow if too much current passes through it, the fuse blows and not your expensive electrical items.\n\nHope that gave you all you needed to know.

Will college be too hard for me? . Hi, I'm 16 years old and out of high school. I didn't graduate but I got my GED because otherwise I would be a 5th or even 6th year! It's not because I'm retarded, I just had emotional problems and missed a couple years of school. My dad was totally against it and is saying that I'm just trying to grow up too fast. I think I can handle college...you know...I could take the mandatory classes first and then concentrate on my major. I've always wanted to be a doctor but will this be too hard for me because I'm 16? I'm not sure because even though in 9th grade I had a 12.9 grade level, I might not be prepared enough for this. I plan to start next semester. . I went to college and graduated in 4 years, but not all college students do.\n\nMy advice would be for you to start out at a JC or community college.  You will get your basic classes out of the way like English, Biology, Psychology, and the like.  You will get used to the level of learning to which you must commit.  All of these credits will transfer when you are ready to go on to a 4 year college.\n\nIn your case, I think this would be the better bet.  One thing that does concern me is that if you were not emotionally mature to handle high school, then how can you be sure you are now emotionally mature to handle the pressures of college? College isn't all parties and social events; you really have to learn to discipline yourself if yo are going to succeed.\n\nGood luck with everything.	Education & Reference

"Is this what the Church is really afraid of from the Da Vinci Code? . I've just finished reading the book, but I guess the part of Bloodline of Christ which the Church is claiming that it doesn't like could be seen as fictious easily, but I guess what they're afraid of actually is that the book is educating the uneducated Christians who didn't know that Jesus was seen as a mortal prophit by his apostels and that the idea of Jesus is God or His son was invented by a vote by the Council of Nicaea in 325AD by the pagan emperor Constantine who made many of the Christians tradition from paganistic customs, like changing the services from Saturday to ""Sun""day, and that among the many apostels' gospels only those that fit the idea were chosen and modified to fool the masses and all others were seen as heretics and that ""sainting"" people is idolatery apparently. So after all these facts came to light, would people become Jews - and deny Jesus as a prophit, or become Muslims - where Mohammed was screaming ""Jesus is a prophit"", or be pagans and worship nature? . Well all this bloodline business is pure speculation, however that Jesus was married to the Magdalene is more than speculation since we have evidence in the writings of the earliest christians. You are right to say the christians never thought Jesus was god and such ideas crept into christianity centuries later. Once the church voted on the divinity of Jesus, they picked & chose the writings which suited them (and it's interesting that even with all the picking & choosing the so-called NT still does not declare that Jesus is god). DC is simply stirring up the old issue again and people are sick & tired of churches dictating what god is. And no, the churches do not like people to go sniffing into the past."	Society & Culture

You're better off healthwise with more veggie servings than fruit.\n\nKeep in mind that a ""serving"" is very small, only 1/2 cup which is the size of a jello pudding cup or 1 cup of raw lettuce/spinach.  Figure a large salad with cucumbers, tomato, mushrooms & carrot curls knocks out 4-6 servings alone.\n\nLook for ways to add veggies:  \n\n*  Make an omelette with salsa or leftover dinner veggies.  \n\n*  Make homemade veggie soups (very easy to do -- can of broth, chopped veggies, simmer until veggies are tender).  \n\n*  Make a small salad part of every dinner.  Bagged salad is OK.  use low calorie dressing, DON'T drown it in 300 calories of ranch.\n\n*  Cook 1-2 veggies for dinner (or lunch) including steamed carrots, broccoli, cauliflower, peppers, etc.  Remember how small a serving is.  If you don't like these veggies, pick ones you do like.\n\n*  Do you like spicy?  Make marinated veggies (blanch 1"" veggies in boiling water for 2-3 minutes, shock with cold water and marinate in a Ziploc baggie with low cal Italian dressing).\n\nYou can add fruits also, but calorie for calorie, veggies offer much more bang for your nutritional buck.

It better you be a monkey instead than be a God created supreme being..Please stop whining people!! . People may wonder why, if God exists, He doesnât wave a magic wand and fix things, making or at least influencing everyone so that they do exactly what they âshouldâ do. But God never takes away anyoneâs freedom of choice. Godâs wisdom is to recognize and respect each soulâs individual identity, freedom and inherent goodness. God shares knowledge â a profound understanding of the dualities and dilemmas of love and hatred, happiness and sorrow, victory and defeat, etc. â but He does not make our choices for us. The soul is free to choose âto be or not to beâ, âto love or not to loveâ. Godâs love strengthens the soulâs will to free itself from the distresses caused by vices such as selfish desire, anger, fear, ego and attachment. Godâs power helps the soul to recognize its highest potential and to aim for perfection by practising the art of simple living and high thinking. Such practice by a significant number of souls eventually brings about positive change in the whole of humanity.\nWhen we understand correctly what God does, and What God doesn't then all our complaints will end.

calculus what is it? . can soemone please identify what calculus is to me i'\nve heard of and i luv math but i dont know what it is . The world around us  is in constant change and motion. Grass grows, a tennis ball flies through the air, water flows down a river, the moon appears to move across the sky. One of the most important fields of study within mathematics is CALCULUS, the study of change and motion. Calculus, perhaps more than any other field within mathematics, is a mixture of pure and applied mathematics.\n\nThe scientific field that makes the greatest use of calculus is physics. Physicists observe the motion and change of objects and create models to describe the patterns in those changes. We might want to know, for example, how fast a ball would be traveling after 10 seconds if we dropped it off a very high cliff. Calculus enables us to determine that, at any instant, the speed of a falling object is 32 times the number of seconds it has been falling. In this case, at 10 seconds the call would be travelling at a rate of about 320 feet (98 meters) per second.	Science & Mathematics

"For those who insist we "" won "" the war in Iraq, what kind of victory did we achieve? . More are dying now than the duration of the war and we are trapped.  We can't leave , staying is not an acceptable option, and there is no clue as to how to dis engage. We have NO good options, ( Thanks to Bush and his neocon cronies ).  Why does it make you feel any better that we "" won "" ?  WHAT did we win? \nJust wondering. . We won a military victory.\n\nUnfortunately, this means very little. We've lost by just about any other account.\n\nFrom reading the other answers, there are still a fair number of people who believe that Iraq had something to do with terrorism. But that just isn't true. Saddam did not tolerate groups like Al Queada because extremist groups represented a threat to his power. Iraq had nothing to do with 9-11. And Iraq had no WMDs.\n\nThis is all stated very clearly in the bi-partisan congressional report, which you can go and read if you'd like.\n\nAnother congressional report that the 9-11/Iraq believers should read is the congressional terrorism report. Terrorism has increased world-wide since the invasion, so again we have not won on that front.\n\nWe've also dumped over $500 billion into this effort and have nothing to show for it as far as remuneration goes. The government has had to borrow more money from countries like China to pay for it since there isn't enough tax revenue to cover it, ploughing us further into debt. So we have not won on the economic front.\n\nFrom a political standpoint, we've spit in the face of the UN and burned all our political capital we had. We ignored our allies. Everyone was warning against this. And still we went in. Our credibility is now quite low throughout the world, especially in the Middle East. Again, no victory there.\n\nFrom a humanitarian view, we've lost. The people view us occupiers, not rebuilders. Tensions are high. Thousands have been killed, with more dying every day. It is now looking quite probable that a civil war is in progress and gaining momentum. The CIA predicted this was a likely outcome two years ago.\n\nAll of this could have been avoided if:\n\nA) We didn't go in in the first place. The policy of premption is at best a double-edged sword and at worst an excuse for empire building (see Nazi Germany for an example).\n\nB) If a plan had been developed to win the peace. We didn't have one, or at least not one that was feasible. From looking at the old videos of the time, there seemed to be the notion that the Iraqi's would welcome us with flowers and then join together in harmony and democracy. I find this amusing considering the place has been a hotbed of religious conflict for at least the past 1000 years.\n\nIn the end, we can claim a military victory. But we can claim little else.\n\n~X~"	Politics & Government
Tell Me Everything Is Gonna Be Okay!? . So, I have court in 2 days. My son's deadbeat father and his parents (cause he can't grow up and leave his moms tit) are taking me to court for the 2nd time. My son's father is in jail (whata shocker) and he is wanting my 2 year old son, who he has never cared to see until now, to be able to come visit him in there, so, off to court we go cause the only way my son will step foot inside a jail, is if someone shots me first! So, I'm right. Right? That is the right thing to do? I mean, he does not love my son. He is only doing this because he is getting back at me for filing for child support. And his parents are pissed cause they are the ones paying it. So, I know that its his dad and all but he doesn't know him. He has never been around for him. I have givin him plenty of chances. All of these charges that landed him in jail, he did after my son was born, so he had his chance. Right? . fuck that loser. its his mom doing all the talking. i mean what kinda man wants his kids to see him in jail. something to be real proud of huh.yeah babe bring him to the ppokey to see me in my orange jump suit, getting frisked, by the way theyll frisk you and your son too,handcuffed, smells like shit,and around a bunch of other low lifes. youll win that case unless the judge is a hick.

"does the moon spin????? . PLEASE I NEED THIS FOR A PROJECT DUE ON MON. AND I NEED HELP!!! . Yes, the moon spins (or rotates) once for each revolution (orbit).  This happens because the moon is ""tidally locked"" to the earth.  \n\nThe moon exerts tidal forces on the earth because it pulls harder on the part of the earth closer to the moon and less hard on the part of the earth father from the moon.  The result is tides--the ocean bulges up on the side close to the moon because of the harder pull and actually bulges up away from the moon on the far side because of the weaker pull.\n\nThe earth also exerts tidal fores on the moon.  The moon has no oceans (and never did), but the solid rock of the moon bulged.  The moon used to spin much faster, but bulging and rotating causes friction, which slowed the moon's rotation until it keeps one face toward the earth.  Thus, the bulge is fixed in one place on the moon and no more friction!"	Science & Mathematics

I said OK, its been a week and nothing has changed.  Is he even interested?  What do I do to get him to call?  What do I do to get him to hang out? . You can't make a person do something if they don't want to do it.  Maybe he is ready for a casual relationship, and not something serious. The not calling thing is probably his way of saying, I want to take it slower.  I would just ease up on calling him, and just leave a casual message every now and then, and see what happens from there.  If he doesn't change in an appropriate amount of time, I would move on.

Has anyone heard of cervical polyps? . How common is it in 24 year old with 2 kids.Does anyone have info on this.Also if anyone else has gone through this . Cervical polyps, also called endocervical polyps, are a growth of tissue in the cervix. The cervix is the neck of the uterus which opens into the vagina. Women of any age may have cervical polyps.\n\nPolyps are very rarely cancer, and they seldom develop into cancer of the cervix. However, we can be sure that a polyp is a benign polyp only by removing it and looking at the tissue in the lab.\nMost cervical polyps are discovered during routine pelvic exams. To confirm that a polyp is benign, your health care provider will do a biopsy. This means he or she will remove the polyp with a small sharp instrument. Your provider may scrape the base of the polyp to make sure all of the polyp is removed. He or she may put a type of paste on the cervix to control any bleeding . The tissue removed will be sent to a lab to be viewed under a microscope. The biopsy can usually be done in your health care provider's office.	Health
"if you collect all sales receipt for this year, could you file them with your state tax to get it all back? .  . If I understand your question correctly, you're wondering if you can deduct the sales tax for items you purchased during 2005 for your 2005 federal/state taxes.  From what I understand using TurboTax the answer is ""yes"" you can claim the total amount you paid in sales tax as opposed to claiming the standard deduction the govt. offers you.  We did that on our taxes last year and plan to do it again this year, since we purchased some big ticket items.\n\nThe easiest way I've taken care of receipts is I gather the receipts each month and put them in their own envelope (i.e., January, 2005; February, 2005, etc.).  At the end of the month, I take the receipts, add up the sales tax I paid for that month, and write it on the front of the envelope.  At the end of the year during tax time, I add all the 12 different figures on the front of the envelopes up and punch it in on TurboTax.  I then file the envelopes away."	Business & Finance

"Cesium metal has a binding energy work function of 184 kJ/mole...? . Cesium metal has a binding energy work function of 184 kJ/mole. If electromagnetic radiation of wavelength 0.628nm is shone on cesium metal, at what maximum velocity (in m/s) will the electron be ejected from the surface of the metal. How fast is this velocity compared to the speed of light (i.e. what percentage of c does this velocity equal?)\n\nI know the answer is 2.64 x 10 ^7 m/s\n\nbut I just need to know what formula to use and how to get there.. . The binding energy of an individual electron in Cs metal is given by the molar work function divided by Avogadro's number:\n\nE_e = 184 kJ/mol / 6.022*10^23 mol^-1\nE_e = 3.055*10^-19 J\n\nThe energy of a photon with wavelength 0.628 nm is given by:\n\nE_p = h*c/lambda\n\nwhere h is Planck's constant\nc is the speed of light in a vacuum\nlambda is the wavelength\n\nso, in this case,\n\nE_p = (6.626*10^-34 (kg*m^2)/s * 2.998*10^8 m/s)/ 0.628*10^-9 m\n\nE_p = 3.163*10^-16 J\n\nE_p exceeds E_Cs by a large margin, so the incoming photon has more than enough energy to eject an electron from the material.  Any energy imparted to an electron that is in excess of the amount needed to eject the electron from the metal will show up as kinetic energy of the electron.\n\nAn electron in a Cs atom beneath the surface of the matrial will require more energy to be ejected than one closer to the surface because the subsurface electron needs additional energy to make its way to the surface.  A electron on a Cs atom at the very uppermost surface will require the least energy to be ejected, and that energy is equal to its binding energy, and it will therefore have the largest ""excess"" energy, largest kinetic energy, and highest speed.\n\nIn this case, the ""excess"" energy (Call it E#) is:\n\nE# = E_p - E_e = 3.163*10^-16 J - 3.055*10^-19 J = 3.160 * 10^-16 J\n\nThis energy shows up as kinetic energy:\n\nE# = 0.5 * m * v^2\n\nwhere m is the mass of an electron\nv is the speed of the electron\n\nIn this case:\n\n3.160 * 10^-16 J = 0.5 * 9.109*10^-31 kg * v^2\n\nv = 2.634*10^7 m/s  (I get a slightly different number than the one you were given, which I attribute to rounding differences)\n\nThis speed is 2.634*10^7/2.998*10^8 = 0.088 = 8.8% that of the speed of light in a vacuum."

I used H&R Block in Chicago (Lincoln Park).  I had complicated tax issues because I had recently changed jobs, sold a mutual fund, and moved from one city to another.  My original try at using TurboTax returned a strange result--it suggested that I owed several thousand dollars, despite my expectation that I should be getting a refund.  The tax professional I worked with at H&R Block was very helpful and when he finished my taxes, it turned out that I was entitled to a significant refund after all.  Well worth the $250 it cost to have my taxes prepared.	Business & Finance
Fantasy Football Advice for my QB and Defense, please help? . Here's my team. \nI'm not feeling very confident about it even though I am on top of my league at 9-1 (Standard 10 team Yahoo 1 pt 20 yds and 6 per TD) I've gotten lucky with matchups, but my luck is bound to run out, and soon.\n\nQB Eli Manning \nWR Marvin Harrison \nWR Donald Driver \nWR Reggie Brown \nRB Tiki Barber \nRB Ahman Green \nTE Kellen Winslow \nBN Anthony Thomas \nBN Deion Branch \nBN Terry Glenn \nBN Carnell Williams \nBN Maurice Jones-Drew \nBN Chris Henry \nK Jeff Wilkins \nDEF Jacksonville \n\nSo here are the questions:\n1) My QB situation is horrible (last week I did play Kitna, fortunately, but have since cut him).\nSo the question is, which if any of these guys do I get off the WW?\nAnd who do I start this week?  And who would I cut?\nTrent Green\nBrett Farve\nJon Kitna\n\n2) Is Jax a decent defense to stick with? Other options on the WW include:\nSan Diego \nNew York Giants \nOakland \nPittsburgh \nMiami \nArizona . I cant believe someone has dropped some of those defenses!!! I would try and get San Diego or Miami defense....both have been solid, barring my Bengals last week....as far as QB, I just picked up Green myself.....Im a big fan, but having Gonzalez out will hurt him some. My other QB's are Farve and Brees....so if I were you Id look at the matchups and pick what looks like the best move....Kitna has done suprising well now that they have opened up thier offense and Kevin Jones is running the ball well. but of the three, Farve is your safe pick, Green is your long shot (depending on how well he has recovered, Id still go with him) and Kitna is your in between guy....never knowing if he is gonna put up 150 yards and 2 INT's or 300 yards and 2 TD's....good luck :) and if you need room....go ahead and cut Carnell williams.....I held on to him up till this week, but havent even played him once this year....

When you get to the Stanley Cup Finals, there is a chance of two equally seeded teams meeting up.  If that is the case, it goes to regular season record.  If those are equal, then it goes to total GF (goals for - whoever has more).  If all the planets are aligned and those are equal, then it goes to GA (goals against - whoever has less).  There is one more deciding factor, but I can't remember what it is.\n\nIt doesn't matter at this point in the playoffs - Edmonton will always be the road team.  If it came down to Edmonton and Tampa Bay (8th seed in the East), then it would go to regular season record.	Sports

how does dopler radar work and what are some problems with it.? .  . There are two kinds of doppler radar. One is the radar cops use to tell if you are speeding. The waves come out of the radar gun and bounce off your car. Depending on whether your car is moving toward the radar or away, it either adds a little energy to the waves or takes a little away. This changes the frequency (how many waves per second.) The radar gun detects the reflected waves coming back (like an echo) and calculates the speed based on the difference between the original frequency and the frequency when it returns changed. The radar gun displays a number, and that's how fast you are going. They are very accurate.\n\nDoppler weather radar works in a similar way, but it is measuring the speed of the clouds. The faster the clouds move, it generally means the heavier the rain is (also for violent thunderstorms and tornados.) The radar picks up the movement of the clouds, because just like the metal in your car, they reflect some of the microwaves that the radar set puts out. Same as the speed radar, they can tell whether the storm is moving toward the radar or away from it, and how fast. A computer assigns each speed value a different color and that is the radar map you see on the news channel. It shows the clouds all moving at slightly different speeds, with the fastest ones being the most dangerous (dump the most rain, generate the most lightning, cause the most wind damage.)\n\nProblems with it. If you are not moving toward the cop car or away from it, they can't tell how fast you are moving. The radar can't tell anything about something moving at a right angle to the radar beam. The waves come out in a fairly tight beam, like a searchlight, only invisible. The object has to stay in the beam for the radar system to recognize the waves that are coming back. In the case of an object moving across the beam, the waves return with their frequency unchanged, meaning that it is not moving closer toward or further away from the radar, then it moves out of the beam and the radar doesn't know it is there any more. It does not 'see' it.  That's why it can't tell how fast that item is moving. \n\nI think that weather radar usually has several stations throughout an area, or the radar beam sweeps across the area like a searchlight, so it can show several overlapping pictures of the same storm. Also, if it is just an air mass (no clouds) the radar can't 'see' it, because the radar waves go through the air. Air is transparent to radar, just like it is to light.\n\nI haven't said anything about how the radar set generates microwaves, or about how military stealth jets are less visible to radar, that would be another whole long topic. I think you wanted to know how the radar works in relation to the outside world, not how it works inside. I hope this helps.	Education & Reference

What is the length of the longest side? . http://www.e-zgeometry.com/pow/pictures/16.gif there is the link to the picture. thanks could you add detail on how you solved it?  I want to learn how to do it in the future. . The longest line is BC.  (See the correctly drawn diagram in the attached link.)\n\nThis relies on a rule of triangles that the longest side is *always* opposite the biggest angle.\n\nLook at the two upper triangles (ABF and FED).  Their biggest angle is on the outside making their longest edges part of the inner triangle (BFD).\n\nHowever, for that triangle, the longest side is BD which is longer than any of the other sides so far.  So far we have eliminated all other sides above as shorter than BD.\n\nThat gets us to the bottom triangle whose longest side is BC (longer than BD).\n\nThus the longest line is BC... \n\nAs you noted, the picture is *definitely* not drawn to scale.\n\nJust for fun, I decided to take the measurements and actually draw the image *to scale*.  The resulting picture is attached as a link.  Hopefully now it is more apparent that BC is the longest side, as proven previously.\n\nIn the future, I'd look out for angles like BDC that are deliberately drawn far from their correct value.  That was the first clue that BC might be the longest side...\n\nAlso, as others have noted, until you are given at least one measurement, you can't determine the actual length, just the relative length.  For example, BC is about 4% longer than BD...	Science & Mathematics
What is your opinion about gay/lesbian couples adopting children? .  . There was once a star trek episode that explained specific points that dictate whether something is an organism or not and one was that you had to be able to reproduce.  Man and women can, in general, reproduce but woman and woman and man and man cannot?  Together it is impossible for them to reproduce (with the exeptions of hermaphrodites whose case is arguable)  I believe in God and he made man and woman to be together. It was such an ingenious plan that we are perfect puzzle pieces foreach other, but like the humans we are (carnal and unable to easily overcome our inadaquacies) choose to go the direct opposite of what God intended.  I'm sorry to the homosexual population if you are offended. I honestly am.  I do not hate you but I do not have to agree with you.  I have many friends that i love but do not agree with and some of those are homosexual.  Its just that if you did not understand your sexuality in the first place then why do you think you are for sure homosexual?  I do not believe it is a natural affection but purely choice (which thank God we have) Choice.  You choose your feelings but I do not condemn you for that.  I dont condemn you at all but I condemn homosexuality.  Its not natural but you can do what you wish.  I just think that if you cannot naturally have children as a couple, let others who lost the opportunity but do have it naturally as a man and women, adopt.  Do you understand? I think I'm just being confusing. sorry.	Politics & Government

During class discussion, introduction of the term ""force constant"", (the slope of the general equation F = -kx) should be introduced. This law is called Hooke's Law. Put simply, Hooke's law expresses the ""stretchiness"" of a given spring. \n\n \nDuring whiteboard discussions of the students' results they should discover that force (F) is proportional to the displacement (x) of the spring. This displacement is the distance that the spring stretches from its normal (equilibrium position or length) when a mass is suspended from it. (Keep in mind this is for a static test of the spring.) The slope of the graph is called the force constant (k) for that particular spring (in N/m units). A stiffer spring has a higher spring constant. No matter how much mass is hanging from the spring, the spring will exert a constant force resisting the force of gravity on the hanging mass. \n\nStudents may find that the slope of the F vs. x relation is not a straight line, that is, that the spring constant, k, is not ""constant"" for some springs. Note that most springs are not ""ideal"", and therefore many do not obey Hooke's law, especially over large ranges in forces. If students find that the function that best fits their F vs. x data is not a straight line. Non-linear, empirical best-fits (regression curves) to the data collected are fine to introduce at this point, as well as the limitations of many springs in that they do not all conform to Hooke's law. \n\nSome groups should show a large y-intercept for their spring F vs x graphs. Discuss the significance of the y-intercept and have the students propose explanations for this. They should recognize that the stiffer springs require more force to get it to start stretching. Hence there is a threshold value of force required to register a measureable displacement, and this threshold is the y-intercept of the F vs x graph (for x = 0). \n\nDuring the class discussion, you should point out the relationship between the equation for the potential and kinetic energy of the jumper (and his/her potential energy (P.E. = mgh) at that position) to the equation for the spring (F = -kx). It will be necessary to make this clear before proceeding to the Egg Test.  For the prediction that the students will make, the ""h"" value is the height of the weight suspended from the spring above the top surface of the egg. The students will need to accurately predict this distance, and set up their experiment so that the maximum extension of the spring when the weight is released is exactly ""h"". This will permit the weight to touch, but not crack the egg. The ""x"" value is the distance the spring will stretch using the prescribed mass. The gravitational potential energy is a function of the height of the object and the object's mass. The kinetic energy is a function of the object's velocity and mass. Since the mass remains constant in the fall of a bungee jumper, its value cancels in the equation leaving gh = 1/2v2, and gh + 1/2kx2 = 0. Finally, when solving for the height of the ""platform"" of the jumper/object, students need to find that h = 1/2kx2 /g.\n\nF = ma and mgh = 1/2mv2 and F = -kx\n\nSince PE = KE, so PE + 1/2mv2 = 0, so mgh = 1/2 kx2 and mgh + 1/2 kx2 = 0"	Science & Mathematics

Because it has 2 processing cores which tremendously increase it's multitasking power over the 3.0 Ghz single-core processor. Also, the core 2 duo is 64-bit, unlike the P4 which is 32 bit. This is a good iinvestment for the not too distant future since we should start seeing more and more 64 bit programs cropping up in the next few years. 64-bit processors can also deal with far greater amounts of RAM than 32-bit processors.

is the real estate market inflated in all major cities in the u.s.? .  . I will agains the grain on this answer and here is the reason why:\n\nFollowing is an article I wrotte back in November 2005 and this still stands:\n\n(FYI: Speculators GET OUT!! Real true investors/homeowners THERE MIGHT BE SOMETHING HERE!!)\n\nREAL ESTATE MARKET BUBBLE BURST!!!???\n\nWell, weâve heard so much from so many different âexpertsâ but we ask how many print media columnists does it take to create a Real Estate market bubble? They really canât but they can sure create fear on the consumer of a bursting housing bubble.\n\nMost media are always looking for ways to increase circulation, which would equal to profits therefore any story suggesting a bursting bubble is going to attract readers. Not that they write this articles for the sole purpose of inducing fear on the consumer but donât let media stories convince you that a bubble will burst or even worst become a self fulfilling prophecy.\n\nUltimately, the consumer is the one that dictates if there will be a bubble burst in the Real Estate market.\n\nThree important facts that guide property values are:\n\nSupply vs. Demand: If supply of housing is greater than the demand, housing values will drop. If the supply is less than the demand, housing values will rise.\n\n(In California the supply has increased and demand has diminished therefore it has forced prices to dip)\n\nEmployment: This should be a no brainer. Solid and growing employment provides income for down payment and house payments.\n\nInterest rates: This is very powerful driver in creating and sustaining property values. When the rates are reasonable, most people are willing to make important investments like purchasing a home. With lenders now offering easier loan programs to qualify, there are now many people able to purchase a home.\n\nNow, just because lenders have been offering âgenerousâ programs should not encourage people to go out and obtain any type of loan available. Many loans are dangerous and donât fit with everyoneâs lifestyle and economic situation. Many loan agents have been quick to over qualify borrowers and whatâs worst not explain completely the pros and cons of each loan program available.\n\nRates have been creeping up little by little over the past couple of months and are expected to continue to rise a bit more next year as well.\n\nIt could be possible the âbubbleâ will burst but not likely. The Real Estate market will most likely will slow its rapid ascent, level out and maybe dip a bit. But a big burst? I donât think so.\n\nNobody can tell what exactly will happen in 2006 with the Real Estate market or the interest rates. What you can do is get informed and protect yourself against a busting of the bubble. You can sure minimize the damage if there was a burst by planning ahead. How well secured are you in your current job? Your income? Have much equity have tied up with loans? Does the equity you have now along with your savings withstand a dip in your homeâs value during the time you anticipate to own it? \n\nDonât stretch your finances by paying a high price for a home just because youâre stubborn and want to have that home.\n\nAnd one FINAL thought: If you are looking to invest in Real Estate, this might be the best time for you to do it IF AND ONLY IF you are a true investor looking to invest long term. Real Estate is the BEST investment you will ever make in your life!\n\nIf you are a speculator/flipper I suggest you dont do anything right now, you will end up loosing money.	Business & Finance

Every counselor has their own personal styles - I use a lot of humor when appropriate, am down to earth, honest, and try to see things from my client's perspective as much as possible.  I don't pass judgment on the individuals I work with - that's not my job.  But I try to guide them the best I can to find relief and solutions that work for them.	Health

Why were cigarettes invented? . If cigarettes are injurious to health and all that,why did,whoever it is,invent them? . The cigarette was born some time in the 18th century: beggars in Seville began to pick from the ground the cigar ends left by the seÃ±oritos (rich young men), wrapped the tobacco remains with paper and smoked them. The first attested use of this habit can be seen in three 18th century paintings by Francisco de Goya: La cometa (The kite), La merienda en el Manzanares (Picnic by the river Manzanares) and El juego de la pelota a pala (The ball and paddle game).\n\nThe use of tobacco in cigarette form became increasingly popular after the Crimean War. This was helped by the development of tobaccos that are suitable for cigarette use. During World War I and World War II, cigarettes were rationed to soldiers. During the second half of the 20th century, the adverse health effects of cigarettes started to become widely known and severe health warnings became commonplace on cigarette packets.	Health

It pains me that this Music is generally so rejected. . Hello\n\nFrom someone who dislikes most jazz they've heard let me explain my thoughts..\n\nPerhaps because the layout is different from pop music.. the structure of the songs.. people are subconciously expecting a top40 formula in 4/4 and they're getting something totally different.  It can be quite difficult to stay on top of a jazz song.. the instruments start to sound as if they're having their own fast dialog with each other.. and its in a language I dont quite understand, so how can I enjoy the dialog when I dont know what they're saying?\n\nJazz seems similar in essence to much classical music with that respect.. the music is a lot more dynamic and 'alive' (if you will) than most of the top40 stuff playing on the radio..\n\nthat and the instruments.. personally, the timbre of a saxophone literally gives me a headache.. I think its the frequency space it takes up.. a squeeling trumpet can do the same.. (actually a squeeling anything can do it hehe)\n\njust some thoughts.. hope I havent offended you. :c)	Entertainment & Music

"In the 2008 Presidential election, will you vote for who you like, or against who you don't? . I realize that this question might be a little frustrating to most of you, but some of you will get it. For those who do, my purpose for this question is because its become more apparent to me that the reason voting has increased in this country should not be attributed to pure interest in success, but rather a lack of awareness. I feel that people will vote for what they believe to be the lesser of two evils rather than getting to know the candidates. The media plays devil's advocate every four years, and those of us who are really paying attention end up suffering for another four. . You are correct.  Many people are voting against someone rather than voting for someone.  IMHO, that is worse than not voting at all.  The ""against"" people are actually cancelling out the vote of someone believing in the issues.  In the last pres. election, I would ask people ""who are you favoring and why?""  I didn't persuade to Dem or Rep.  But many people would say ""Kerry, because I hate W. this or that, yadda, yadda.""  Bill Clinton addressed a democratic convention of some sort and told them that the democratic party needs to be a party for something, not against something.  Unfortately, both parties have drifted even farther away from the center.  The right has gone too far right and the left has gone too far left.  The overall is still probably about center, but the standard devation is so huge that people spend more time arguing about something than acutally doing anything."	Politics & Government

He died for our sins? and i am saved? how? . is that mean i can go head rape women, steal, kill people, hurt people, ignore the teaching of God...etc but if i believe that Jesus died for our sins then actually it dosen't matter what i do my sins are already forgiving! otherwise there is no point for him to die for my sins. since Jesus die for my sins, then i am pure and clean from all sins and i can do whatever i want!\nmakes no sense to me. how that possible please? . This is interesting because Christians say that you have to repent and sin no more, but then they call everyone a sinner. In fact it says in their bible that anyone who says they have no sin is a liar. Therefore according to them everyone keeps sinning. So then what is the difference between say adultery or homosexuality or lying or any other so-called sin when Christ supposedly died for sin? Do you see the great problem? It's absurd. It is only accepted by people because they don't have the capacity to think deeply enough to discover how serious the problem is. If they could actually comprehend the magnitude of the problem they would no longer support the doctrine of the cross. For two millennia the churches have gotten away with an absurd doctrine.

Coefficient of kinetic friction? . I'm studying for an exam and came across this problem: a child goes down a playground slide with an acceleration of 1.16 m/s2. Find the coefficient of kinetic friction between the child and the slide if the slide is inclined at an angle of 31.0 degrees below the horizontal. Can someone explain how to solve this problem? Your help is much appreciated. . The balance of forces acting on you: m*a=f1-f2; m is your mass, f1 is the force pulling you down the slope, f2 is force of friction, both being parallel to the slope incline. Thus f1=m*g*sin(b), f2=m*g*cos(b)*k, while g=9.8m/s^2, b=31deg, a=1.16m/s^2, m*g being your weight. Mind! While f1 is a vector parallel to the slope, the force m*g*cos(b) is normal to the slope and should not be taken into account unless friction be present. \nNow m*a=m*g*(sin(b)-k*cos(b)), hence k=(sinb-a/g)/cosb=0.46	Science & Mathematics

Are digital househunting jobs a scam? . I came across an ad on Craigslist for someone looking for people to take pictures of houses - if the pictures fit the criteria of what they are looking for, they'll pay $10.  If they end up buying the house, they'll pay $500.  You are supposed to send pictures of houses that are in nice neighborhoods but the house of interest is vacant, has an overgrown lawn, etc.  In other words, someone has let the house fall into disrepair even though the it's in a nice neighborhood.  There are not supposed to be other houses for sale nearby, and from my understanding of the e-mail I received, the house of interest is not supposed to be for sale either.  I don't really get that - seems like they are looking for houses that aren't for sale but where the owner might be interested in selling if given an offer.

I think they wont take it to court, they are trying to scare us into paying anything since the lawyer asked to settle when I called him. The law firm that took the case is Teller, Levit & Silvertrust P.C\nAny lawyers here that have some real insight?\n\nThanks in Advance....\n\nSincerely,\n\nJennifer S. . Jennifer \n#1 You need to get a lawyer. A corporation cannot represent itself in a judicial proceeding.  \n#2 -- If this was a JUDGMENT, that means that they went through some process and it's enforceable as a matter of law.  Most likely, they filed a lawsuit against you, you didn't respond, so the court entered a ""default judgment"" for the relief requested by the Court.  This could have happened in Ill. OR in Florida. If the latter, then they have merely filed or registered the judgment in Illinois so that they may collect it. \nDid you ever receive a summons and complaint from these people? Did you ignore it, believing that it would go away?  If so, it will be hard to get the judgment vacated.  You usually need some excuse or good reason to have a judgment vacated (although in Cook County, you may get a sympathetic judge, who wants to adjudicate the merits, who will vacate and set the litigation going). See #1.\n#3 They have already ""taken it to court"" if, indeed there was a ""judgment"" filed against you. See #2.  If they merely have filed a complaint seeking judgment, that's a different story, and you have a short amount of time to respond to their allegations.  Get to a lawyer ASAP, otherwise you will be faced with a default judgment.\n#4 -- you won't get good legal advice for this issue here because of the fact-specific nature of your problem (exactly what was filed, the underlying dispute between the parties, etc.) Then you need to think about cost.  How much is the judgment for (or is the Complaint alleging?)? A good lawyer in Chicago will set you back $250.00 an hour at a minimum plus expenses.  If this is something you want to fight, expect $20,000 in fees for litigation at a minimum.  If this is a small matter, expect at least $2,000 in fees to reach an amicable settlement.\n\nThe Illinois State Bar Association should have a referral service on their website if you do not have a lawyer.  If you're willing to pay the going rate ($250.00 for associates, $400-500 for partners) in Chicago, I have some referrals for you.\n\nGood luck."	Politics & Government
The most craziest question you've ever heard of? . If some 'privileged group of people had access to you inner thoughts, you inner monologue, via a computer(it is possible with today's tech), and tried to take over your thoughts by speaking to you 24/7, what would you do.\nIf this group of people ( f...ers in my mind) could create auditory hallucinations in your head via a computer, binary code is pretty much phiysiological creations when developed to the right level, what would you do.\n\nSeriously thin kabout this one, dont call me a crock, \nIF u do your void of serious research on this topic. \n\nI hope serious minds reply, oh my gosh I hope you do.\n\nA computer to brain link, just think about it, cause you have to, I'm letting you know, you'll calll me a worthless though, but then you would be. Cause I'm serious, I've researched harvard, MIT, and all the biggies, their minds are doing this via our NSA'a own technology, which they have a foot in.\nLet me know what you think seriopusly. . Interesting question. Mind control has been a popular subject of science fiction for a long time. Knowing what I do about:\n1) the human brain\n2) the US government\n3) the human spirit\n\nI will give you my opinion. There are always groups of people who wish for complete authority over others, and see it as the best way to control human behavior in large social settings. The mind is very easy to manipulate, and deceive. The majority of people will accept whatever is being sold to them in the name of safety and security.\n\nThere are, however, a minority who never fall into line. This has even been proven with animals in experiments- there is always a small group that never learns to give up. I am more afraid of the majority who would allow chips to be implanted than I am of the ones who would design such a thing. \n\nAs powerful as we can make computers, the human brain will always have more synapses and capacity than any chip, and I am fairly certain that at least some people would see through the disguise. The US government is run as a bureaucratic organization, and thus progress is very inefficient. We are in more danger from a singular minded misanthropic scientist devoting a life of passionate research to this topic, then selling his/ her idea to the government, than we are of the government being able to create the devices on their own. A device might be created that would create hallucinations, or auditory stimulus, but it need to bypass all several billion other connections in order to put the user completely under its control. An intelligent mind would be extremely difficult to subjugate; a genius mind almost impossible.	Science & Mathematics

Is Gmail the best free email service available currently? .  . I think Gmail is the best free e-mail service available.  It offers more storage space than any other service.  They are currently offering over 2GB of storage space.  You have a better opportunity to get a good screen name since it has not been around for as long as some of the other services.  It has a very user friendly interface.  You don't have to delete any e-mail and you can quickly search through all of your archived mail.  They have a very good spam filter.  The text ads are very unobstructive.  And the best thing is that they are always improving this great service!	Computers & Internet

Your friend should give it time and if the guy seems to be doing nothing, well, then he isn't worth the time and effort and quite frankly doesn't deserve any girl.	Family & Relationships

That's the one prior to being issued a temporary green card (""Resident Alien Card""). There is no set time because it always takes longer than the estimate, which is all the DHS will give you. In my case it was about a year. After your interview you can apply for a Travel Waiver. I never applied for one so I don't have any experience of that. I didn't go back 'home' until five years after I arrived.\n\nYour temporary green card is good for three years. In the meantime, usually about a year before it expires, you can start processing for your permanant green card (""Permanent Resident Card""). Once you have that you can come and go as you please."

Perhaps you and I are the physical manifestation of some force or ""power"" in another dimension.

But do you?\n\nMaybe it is really ""time [for you] to open your eyes"". The reason ""kaspersky"" would be the ""best"" antivirus, is because very few (to no) virus writers would take the time to write script to defeat it. The biggest security threat to any if not all programs/av/os's is the more people that use it, the more people will try to edit/manipulate it. Hence, nortan is not as good an av (in your opinion) because.... it is main stream and most companies and consumers use it.

do u think that Iran  really have nuclear  weapon ? .  . To answer this you must have some expertise in the field of Nuclear technology. The worst thing to do is to reply and just answer. This is dangerous. You have to see things from different angles and try to analyze them. Yes, Iran has joined the nuclear gang in Uranium enrichment only i n a very low degree. It is the 10th country to get its hand on the Technology. However Iran is long away from becoming a Nuclear threat with Nuclear bombs and missiles.\n\nThe theocratic government in Iran is using this to oppress the Iranian Opposition and reformists in Iran.

Let x be a steel bar and y be the box.\n\n25x + y = 79\n16x + y = 61\n\n9 steel bars was taken away so\n\n9x = 79 - 61\n9x = 18\nx = 2\n\nNow plug 2 for x in one of the above equations\n\n16(2) + y = 61\n\nSolve for y\n\ny = 61-32\ny = 29.\n\nBox weighs 29 pounds.

"Rey Mysterio info? . Who ever can give me the most info on Rey Mysterio Jr.\nWill get 10pts. . Ãscar GutiÃ©rrez Rubio, better known by his ring names Rey Misterio, Jr., Rey Mysterio, Jr. and Rey Mysterio (born December 12, 1974 in San Diego, California), is a Mexican-American professional wrestler currently performing for World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) on the SmackDown! brand as the current World Heavyweight Champion.\nMysterio is known for his aerial wrestling techniques and has won the WCW/WWE Cruiserweight championship eight times - more than anyone else in history.\nMexico\nGutierrez is a lucha libre luchador as is his uncle and trainer, Rey Misterio, Sr. He debuted as a wrestler in April 1989 at the age of 14 in Tijuana, Mexico. He was too young to wrestle in the United States, as athletic commissions would not give him a license. Technically, he was also underage in Mexico, but enforcement was generally lax. In Mexico, using the stage name Colibri (hummingbird in Spanish), he began a feud with another luchador, Psicosis (who was also trained by Rey Misterio, Sr.). This feud lasted several years even after Gutierrez's career moved to the U.S. When he turned 18, his uncle allowed him to use the ring name ""Rey Misterio, Jr."" Gutierrez later changed the spelling to ""Rey Mysterio, Jr."" and eventually dropped the ""Junior"". In Asistencia AsesorÃ­a y AdministraciÃ³n (AAA) he feuded with Juventud Guerrera which included a tag match with Guiterrez & Misterio, Sr. versus Juventud and his father, Fuerza Guerrera.\n[edit]\nExtreme Championship Wrestling\nIn 1995 he defeated Psicosis during their debut match on Extreme Championship Wrestling (ECW). This match was their first real impact in American professional wrestling, outside of the World Championship Wrestling (WCW)-promoted When Worlds Collide pay-per-view (PPV). Their feud stopped for a while after a Mexican Death Match in November 1995 at the ECW Arena in Philadelphia. Mysterio also appeared at the reunion show, ECW One Night Stand 2005, where he beat Psicosis.\n[edit]\nWorld Championship Wrestling\nRey went on to gain fame in WCW. He went on to win numerous WCW Cruiserweight titles, then Tag Team titles with Kidman, of the Filthy Animals. At this point, Rey made the controversial decision to wrestle without his trademark mask. The Lucha Libre community was offended by this move (this lasted until WCW folded), because of the tradition of luchas keeping their mask on. Since then, several masked luchas, including Juventud and Psicosis, stopped wearing their masks and continue to perform without them.\n[edit]\nWorld Wrestling Entertainment\n\n \nRey Mysterio performing a Springboard Seated Senton on D-Von Dudley.\nIn 2002, Mysterio signed with WWE, but was asked to wear the mask again. In Mexico, one could be fined or even have their license suspended in lucha libre by the Box y Lucha Commission for this; there, once a wrestler loses his mask, he cannot regain it. In deference to this tradition, Mysterio continues to not wear a mask when performing in Mexico. This includes non-wrestling appearances in the Rey Mysterio: 619 DVD produced by WWE, although he wore a mask on the recent tour in Mexico on January 1 and January 20, 2006.\nMysterio began his WWE career on SmackDown! as a babyface in a feud with Kurt Angle. Mysterio later teamed up with Edge to win the WWE Tag Team Championship but after the team lost the titles they soon stop tagging together.\nMysterio later began to feud with Chavo Guerrero, Jr. and his father over the WWE Cruiserweight Championship. During this time Mysterio teamed on occasion with Rob Van Dam, or Spike Dudley to face off against the Dudley Boyz. However, while Mysterio was Cruiserweight Champion Spike Dudley turned heel and joined with the other Dudleys before soon taking the Cruiserweight title from Mysterio.\nMysterio continued to team with Rob Van Dam, and before long the team was able to take the WWE Tag Team Championship from Kenzo Suzuki and Rene Dupree. However, RVD became injured and Mysterio soon"	Sports
Who invented luminol? . Please give links to the answer. . Inventor of Luminol\n\nIn 1895, two scientists named Wiedemann and Schmid, dissolved cathode-ray irriaded alkali halides such as NaCl, NaBr, KCl, and KBr, in water.  They noticed a very weak bluish light.  They also detected light production when irriaded calcium carbonate was âattackedâ by aqueous hydrochloracetic acid, or phosphoric acid4.\n\nLater in 1928, a chemist by the name of Albrecht discovered a specific chemical, that when placed in an aqueous alkaline solution emitted a blue-green light with a fair amount of intensity.  Along with the light, virtually no heat was produced.  This solution contained hydrogen peroxide along with a catalyst.  The catalyst was an alkaline medium with a pH between ten and eleven.  This specific chemical was to later on be called luminol.	Politics & Government

I've noticed that some gods and godesses in the various ancient Indo-European peoples have similar stories and some even have almost the same names. . To a specific Indo-European source? No. Though this is a rather interesting theory. A fair bit of work has been done on it. If you can find works by George Dumezil (translated works, that is. He's French) they make for an interesting read. Really, he is one of the big names in the field.\n\nOf course, the supposedly ultimate source of these similarities is called the Proto-Indo-European cultural group.

If the witness opens the door to an issue (gives a self-serving explanation of an incident) he may be required to answer questions about that incident.\n\nA defendant in a criminal case does not have to take the stand.

can you answer this? . 35 students are seated in 5 rows and 7 columns. is it possible for the students to change seats if every student must move exactly one seat to the left, right, front, OR back. please explain . Imagine coloring the seats in a checkerboard pattern, alternating red and blue.  Since 35 is an odd number you will have 18 seats of one color (red) and 17 of the other (blue).\n\nHave everyone sit down.  Now when everyone moves (up, down, left or right) notice that they must all switch chair colors.  (No diagonal moves allowed).  Everyone on a blue chair must switch to a red chair and vice versa.\n\nYou can see that there is no way to accomplish this.  Everyone on a blue chair could find a red chair, since there are more.  But everyone on a red chair *could not* find a blue chair because there are less, no matter how you arrange the movement, one person will be left out.\n\nIt is not possible with an odd number of chairs.  Try it yourself with a 3 x 3 set of chairs... can't do it, can you?\n\nIn the simplest case you could have everyone switch with their neighbors.  But again, because there are an odd number of chairs, one person has nobody to switch with.  They'd have to stay where they were.  Since they *must* move, you can't accomplish the task.\n\nFor the person that suggested the 'snake' move, the start of the snake would not meet up with the end of the snake, so the person in the last seat couldn't move to the seat vacated by the first person.\n\nThis *will* work if you have an even number of chairs for the total.  You could have 5 x 8 (40 chairs) or 6 x 7 (42) chairs, for example and then people could easily swap around.  But if both the rows and the columns are odd, then the product is odd and you can't do it.	Science & Mathematics

It is possible for immigrants to gain admission to the US aremed forces. I have served with quite a few. However, not an illegal immigrant. There aren't FBI clearance checks for entry, but there is a very rigorous background check. Including an AFIS and NCIC checks, DMV check and the one most any illegal will fail, is the most simple. The records from the high school they graduated from. No diploma, no entry. Yes there are exceptions, called a GED window, but your high school transcripts must be included with the GED certification. There is a minimalist background investigation, but it is there nontheless. But no. There are not illegal immigrants in the US armed forces, and anyone who says so is simply misinformed. I spent 12 years of my life in an intel unit, providing preliminary background checks to the FBI for securuity clearance investigations. The process for entry alone prohibits their entry. There are just too many different things they would have to fake, and it would be the little things that would get them caught. And the penalties for trying to enlist as an illegal are very severe. VERY severe. Crimes against the State, Federal Penitentiary, Leavenworth Ks., severe. That's why I can say there are NO illegal immigrants in the service. If they are there illegally, they have a new title. They are promoted instantly from illegal alien status to spy. \nDon't believe everything you hear. YES there is a legal way to enlist, if you are from a foreign nation. And it's NOT that hard to do. If you're serious about enlisting, I would strongly suggest you contact the area MEPS (Military Enlistment Processing Station) and ask to speak to the NCOIC about advice as to what you would require. It sounds to me like the recruiter you spoke with simply doesn't want to have to deal with the added paperwork. Here on a student visa?

why would you use an alchol thermometer rather than a mercury one to measure the temperature in a freezer? .  . Mercury freezing point: -38.72 degrees C\n\nA mercury thermometer will probably lose accuracy somewhat above the freezing point, because as one approaches the phase\ntransition from liquid to solid, one loses the linear dependence\nof the column length on temperature.\n\n\nAlcohol's freezing point is -117 degrees therefore it doesn't get cold enough to freeze alcohol.\n\nTherefore alcohol is better at low temperatures	Science & Mathematics

"Do a Hymen with no transections mean a young lady is still a virgin.  Can a hymen grow back? For med people.? . I was looking over a case in which a guy was falsely accused of raping his stepdaughter and her friend.  The charges were dismissed because the ""Teenagers"" medical reports stated ""within normal limits (WML)"" and ""No Transections"" in the hymens.  It was alleged that they were forcefully raped.  A coposcopy was performed and nothing came back.  At first I thought ""Hey since one didn't report it for 4 months and the other for 45 days, maybe the hymens grew back.  Now all of my professional friends are telling me how stupid I am and that I should be working in the ""helping men and women that are falsely accused"" field.

Why do people post questions and then never bother to go back and check on them and vote for best answer.? . If we care enough to answer they should care enough to select. . Well, Quiet,\n It seems to me that the majority of people here are 20's and below. Their lifestyle has always included instant, within-seconds types of responses. Everything happens at the speed of light, so they ask the question, give it a minute, check the answer then move on to IMing their friend or whatever electronic, flashy toy they're playing with.\n This is meant with no disrespect, its just that they do their thing, get the info they need, and move on. You can tell that they're in a rush, as half of the questions asked are in shortened form, or some kind of electro slang that's popular with the kids now. I mean, if you can't take 5 minutes to properly spell and grammatically check your question, do you really think that they'll be back to give you a rating?\nMy opinion on the issue.\nCheers !!

why its sp difficult to find a boy friend? .  . The best way to find a boyfriend is to do activities that you enjoy with other people, and through that you may meet someone that is compatible with you.  \n\nFor example, maybe you like to do country line dancing, so you go there and dance, and maybe you'll meet a guy who also likes it and is interested.  \n\nOr if you like reading, go to the library and read out in a large area with chairs next to you.  You never know who might come sit down next to you.  \n\nOr you can try online dating sites such as Yahoo Personals (I met my wife through this site when it was free), or try speed dating.  \n\nIf you just sit at home and wonder why guys aren't knocking at your door, it is because they don't know about you since you are sitting at home.

OR\nLook in the ""Government"" section of your phone book.\nThe District Attorney will help you and file proper paperwork. You will probably need to get yourself a divorce attorney. Since he abandoned you and remarried, the divorce will probably go pretty good for you, legally speaking.\nYour husband's new marriage is invalid, in the case of multiple marriages, the first one is the legal marriage.\n\nGet on the ball, I know you are hurt but, you need to protect yourself, as his legal wife, you could be held responsible for any debts he incurs or any lawsuits against him.

"explain the following abbreviations used in web design GIF,JPEG,URL,FTP,Eexpail TELNET,GOPHER IMG,SRC? .  . JPEG is often used in place of JFIF. JFIF is the JPEG File Interchange Format, the main image file format defined by the Joint Photographic Experts Group. The JFIF MIME type is 'image/jpeg' (defined in RFC 1341) and its most common file name extensions are '.jpg', '.jpe', '.jpeg', '.jfif', '.jfi'.\n\nJFIF is most commonly used for photorealistic images at 24 bits per pixel, using lossy compression. The higher the degree of compression (the smaller the file size), the lower quality the image is. It is a trade-off between size and quality.\n\nAlternatively, JPEG is used (again, improperly) to refer to Exif images. Exif is the Exchangeable image file format, a specification for the file format used by digital cameras. Exif uses existing image formats such as JFIF and TIFF, and adds support for metadata tags (comments, creation time, copyright, etc.). It was created by Japan Electronic Industry Development Association (JEIDA).\n\nGIF, the graphic interchange format, is a bitmap image format introduced by CompuServe in 1987. It is possibly the most commonly used image file format on the Internet. The GIF MIME type is 'image/gif' with the file extension '.gif'. It supports up to 256 colors and supports LZW lossless compression (meaning there is no trade-off between quality and size), but larger images usually have much larger file sizes than with other formats.\n\nGIF also supports animations and transparency (two things the main JFIF standard do not support).\n\nA URL is a uniform resource locator, as defined in RFC 1738. It was defined primarily by Tim Berners-Lee (credited with having created the World Wide Web) at CERN (a particle accelerator lab) and other members of the URI working group of the IETF. URL provides a generic syntax for describing locations on the Internet. URL has largely been superceded by URI. An example URL (with permitted quoting marks) is <URL:ftp://ds.internic.net/rfc/rfc822.txt>.\n\nA URI is a uniform resource identifier, defined in RFC 2936, provides a generic syntax for the location of resources (files or streams, for example) on the Internet. URI can basically be semtantically translated as:\n[scheme "":""][""//"" [username ["":"" password] ""@""] host ["":"" port]]path[""?"" query][""#"" fragment]\nwhere bracketed groups (""[ ... ]"") are optional and quoted items are string literals. Some example URIs follow:\n\n/question/;_ylt=Ah78hEWZdiAlRiqzZaqAppsezKIX (just a path)\n//answers.yahoo.com (an ""authority"" with only host name, and an empty path)\nhttp:/question (scheme and path)\nhttp://anonymous:user@example.com:80/some/file?a=b&c=d#item (all optional parts included)\n//127.0.0.1 (an authority made up of an IPv4 address)\nftp://bob:le214@[::1]:2100/docs (::1 is an IPv6 address)\ntelnet://www.my.site:1080\nfile:///some/random/file\n\n\nFTP is the file transfer protocol, defined in RFC 959. FTP supports authoritative file management capabilities using the typical client-server paradigm. To quote RFC 959, ""The objectives of FTP are 1) to promote sharing of files (computer programs and/or data), 2) to encourage indirect or implicit (via programs) use of remote computers, 3) to shield a user from variations in file storage systems among hosts, and 4) to transfer data reliably and efficiently.""\n\nTelnet is a high level TCP protocol. It's primary purpose is to provide a simple mechanism for a client to communicate with a server and vice versa. A telnet client is often used for other text-based protocols or remote textual user interfaces.\n\nThe Internet Gopher Protocol is a ""distributed document search and retrieval protocol"", defined in RFC 1436. The Gopher RFC defines a gopher as ""software following a simple protocol for burrowing through a TCP/IP internet."" It is largely defunct now, replaced by the World Wide Web.\n\nRFC, whic"	Computers & Internet

"Why are police allowed to be selective of who to prosecute when they run a red light.? . I got pulled over for running a temporary red light.  Police informed me that 3 cars in front of me also did this but they did not pull any over.  Why are the police allowed to prosecute selective offenders?  Shouldn't the police have to be consistent and fair?  No pictures, have I got grounds to contest? . One officer, or two officers in one car, cannot pull over four cars at the same time. It's just like pulling over a car for speeding when several other cars are speeding, too. You were probably the last one of the group that ran the light. So you were the first they got to.\n\nIf you had been #2 or #3 in line, instead of last, you would have gotten away and the guy in the back would have gotten the ticket. It is only ""selective"" because they picked the last car in line. They didn't pick based on the driver, vehicle type, or anything other than just position.\n\nFair? Maybe not.

"I have this very old violin.? . All i see see is Antonius Stradiuarius Cremonensis\nFaciebat Anno 17\nPossible 21 after the 17 . A label of Antonius Stradivarius Cremonensis? \n     \n\n\nHave you found a violin with the label ""Antonius Stradivarius Cremonensis""? Keep cool. It's almost certainly a fake. In the past some restorers have stuck labels (genuine or forged) inside instruments of various origins and there has been a proper business in labels, apart from the selling of violins. There have also been cases of old-time violin makers who would put the names of other contemporary makers on their own violins. \nNowadays, no violin expert would judge the value of a violin by its label. \nLabels such as ""Antonius Stradivarius Cremonensis Faciebat Anno 17"", followed or not by circles with crosses, initials or other particular signs are made (in series) to be completed before being stuck on the instrument: actually ""... Anno 17"" shows only the first two numerals of any year of the 18th century. A complete label should read ""... Anno 1715"" or ""... Anno 1707"", or at least an year of the 18th century. \nThere are also cases where you can't even seriously talk of fakes. A label like the following: ""Antonius Stradivarius Cremonensis / Faciebat Anno 1721 / Made in Bohemia"" is a joke rather a fake, considering that Stradivari never learned English. \n\nHowever, if you wish to learn more about the quality of the instrument you should take it to a violin maker, who will let you know if it is a good quality instrument. He may not be able to give you details of the period or school, but will be able to tell you if it was made by a good craftsman or on an assembly line. The addresses of violin makers, under the headings of States, can be found in the Reports of magazines for enthusiasts such as ""Strad"" or ""String"". \nIf, after the first check, the violin maker recognizes a particular quality in the instrument, it may be worth while asking for a specialist's appraisal (Expertise) on the part of an expert and connoisseur (usually a restorer or well-known maker) who will issue a certificate of attribution and an estimate of the instrument's value. \nThe cost of the expert's survey is, as a rule, quite modest if it concerns merely a verbal evaluation. There is, instead, a fixed price and a percentage of the instrument's value when a certificate evaluation is wanted. \nIf you so wish, you can have a first opinion from the expert violin makers of the Cremona School of Violin Making (Scuola di Liuteria) sending photographs or colour slides taken in the most professional manner, with shots of the whole instrument and of its details. The evaluation may not be infallible (to value an instrument is not the same thing as valuing its photo), but it is possible to get a general indication. It's the best that can be done without having the instrument to hand."	Entertainment & Music

What is decompression syndrome? .  . Background: Although decompression sickness (DCS), a complex resulting from changed barometric pressure, includes high-altitudeârelated and aerospace-related events, this article focuses on decompression associated with the sudden decrease in pressures during underwater ascent, usually occurring during free or assisted dives. People involved with tunneling projects and those in submarines during emergencies may also experience the physiologic effects of decreased pressure brought on by such ascents. \n\nSince 4500 BCE, humans have engaged in free (breath-hold) diving to obtain food and substances from shallow ocean floors at depths of 100 or more feet. The 1994 record-setting breath-hold dive of Ferreras-Rodriguez to 417 feet attests to this human feat. Humans began experimenting with crude diving bells as early as 330 BCE. These bells were submerged containing only air. In 1690, the first diving bell with a replenishing air supply was tested. The first crude underwater suit dates back to 1837, and helium was first used in place of nitrogen in 1939. \n\nAll these early diving methods required a physical connection to a support platform or boat. The Aqua-Lung, developed by Cousteau and Gagnon, and the submarine escape appliances, developed by Momsen and Davis in the 1930s, were forerunners of the Self Contained Underwater Breathing Apparatus (SCUBA), which frees divers from the limitations of tethering. \n\nThe increasing popularity of scuba diving and the growth of commercial diving have increased the frequency of deep-pressure injuries. Even in regions far from coasts, individuals are diving in quarries, lakes, rivers, and caves. In addition, the ability to travel rapidly between areas of disparate altitudes in a matter of hours (including the exacerbation caused by decreased pressures in flight) increases the chance of experiencing decompression injuries. Emergency physicians worldwide should know the physiologic effects and management of decompression sickness.\n\n\nPathophysiology: Changes in pressure affect only compressible substances in the body. The human body is made primarily of water, which is noncompressible; however, the gases of hollow spaces and viscous organs and those dissolved in the blood are subject to pressure changes. Physical characteristics of gases are described by the following 4 gas laws, which quantify the physics and problems involved in descending under water.	Health

What do I've to do to get into Princeton in three years time? . I am right now I a 10th grader (if anyone knows, that's British F.3) studying in a not-so-bright high school in Hong Kong and I will be entering my senior years in the coming acedamic year. I have a near-native ability in English (both reading,writing and oral) and I'm also quite good at Chinese.\nMy question is that:\n1.) Do I have to study another foriegn language even I already have been studying English as a second language?\n2.) Is Maths in final year definitely required?\n3.) Does anyone knows whether the HKCEE (the local Hong Kong public exam, equals to the British version) counts?\n4.) Is sports a must?\nThank You. . Trust me, compared to many American kids your already way ahead of the curve. Now for your questions. \n1) No, Egnlish & Chinese is enough. Some Americans can't even speak their on language very well.\n2) Math? Algebra, Calculus, maybe Statistics. Those will do for most majors.\n\n3)You will have to ask a school official.\n\n4) No, not required.\n\nI wish you well, Princeton is one of the top Schools in the US. Many will apply and don't get in. Have a second or third choice you would also like to attend. While quite long trip for you, a campus visit is aways a good thing in making your selection of schools.

Any idea what is the basis for this calculation. \n\ncalling all finance punters and other smart people.\nthanks. . To figure the payment on an installment loan, use the PMT() function in Excel, if you have that. If not, the formula can be derived from the present value formula and the perpetuity formula. The present value of a future cash flow is the future cash flow divided by (1 + Rate/frequency)^(years x frequency). The present value of perpetuity (the same amount paid every period) is amount per period/(Rate/frequency). Thus a 7 year installment loan with monthly payments (frequency = 12 payments per year) and an 8% interest rate can be valued as the difference between a perpetuity starting now and a perpetuity starting in 7 years. Thus:\n\n600,000 = (Payment/(8%/12))x(1 - 1/((1+(8%/12))^(7 x 12))\nThe interest per month at 8% would be 4,000, not the 3,946 you calculate, so I am unaware of the particular detail of why that is different. The formula above results in a monthly payment of about 9,352. If you want to check it the long way, deduct the interest from the payment, and that is the reduction of principal that period, so you can recalculate the interest for the next period and see how much more the principal declines. If you carry this out to the maturity, the balance should be zero.	Business & Finance
how was celsius and fahrenheit discovered? .  . Temperature is a physical property of a system that underlies the common notions of hot and cold; something that is hotter has the greater temperature.\n\nThe degree Celsius is also a unit increment of temperature for use in indicating a temperature interval (a difference between two temperatures or an uncertainty). âCelsiusâ is named after the Swedish astronomer Anders Celsius (1701 â 1744), who first proposed a similar system two years before his death. \n\nFahrenheit is a temperature scale named after the German physicist Gabriel Fahrenheit (1686â1736), who proposed it in 1724.

i am a white guy who believes blacks have been and are still oppressed? . i grew up from the late 50s threw the 60s, i remember when it wasnt legal for blacks to vote,,not allowed into certain parts of town,and even today blacks still have a harder time,, just because of the color of thier skin, my best friend who i have known since i was 5 years old is black, and i just want to say how sorry iam for this happening to them,, my question is why,, why did it happen,why does someone hate someone just because of color?? . Unfortunately ,it is human nature for people to want to feel superior over someone else.  Racism is only one way of doing this.  There is also sexism, classism, agism.  I am biracial, and when my parents married in the '60's, trust me, it was not a good situation to live through.  But, they did it and have been together for 40 years. My maternal grandfather was a racist through and through (disowned my mom for marrying a black man; thought all black men wer pimps, rapists, robbers, or in jail - images he constantly saw on t.v through t.v. shows and the news) until he met my dad.  Then he changed his mind completely.  Thought my dad was the smartest man he had ever met. Sometimes it's just complete ignorance (as with my grandfather).	Society & Culture

So, given my bad German, fahrenheit might be ""with drive"" or ""drivingness"" or some such.  Literal translation doesn't do it justice.  Finally, I found a page which says:\n\nFahrenheit is a name that was given to people from Fahrenhaupt (in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern). The place name Fahrenhaupt seems like it ought to mean `main drive.'

why does our government kill criminals to show that killing is wrong? .  .

My personal opinion is that it is hard to sell the idea of the sanctity of life when you are engaged in taking life yourself; it just cheapens life in general and makes it seem less important. I also hear people say that it is the ultimate punishment, the absolute worst punishment the government can dish out. But if you read about being in prison, or listen to what people in prison for life have to say, it seems to me that a true life sentence, without any possibility of parole, is a much worse punishment.

"Is this a Sign (10 pts 4 best)? . Okay so theres this guy I really like and I sit behind him in class. We talk all the time but he only seems to remeber the little things we have in a conversation. Like one time I kept repeately telling him I was going to Six Flags on Saturday and then after I got back I told him how much fun I had and he goes ""Doing what?"" and I was kind of annoyed that he forgot but he remember the littlest things that I said weeks ago.I heard that it is a sign that guys like you if they remeber the little things, but what I wanna know is is that true? . It""s true they do get annoyed when you repeat yourself over and over again and they just tune you out. But if he remembers the little things then thats a plus because it means he does have an interest in you.  Guys are not big on remembering the big stuff. why I don't know. but if they remember the little stuff then thats a plus. Don't get frustrated with him just go with the flow unless something really really important gets forgotten I wouldn't worry about it.\nGood luck."	Family & Relationships

"What is the most addictive 'street"" drug? . Doing research for school, what are the side effects for cocaine and other drugs? . The most addictive drug out there is nicotine. The most addictive illegal (or 'Street' drug) is the smoked version of Meth.\n\nHere is a list of addictive drugs from the most addictive to the least from my abnormal psychology book...\n\nNicotine\nIce, Glass (smoked methamphetamine)\nCrack\nCrystal Meth (injected methamphetamine)\nValium (diazepam, a common prescription drug)\nQuaalude\nSeconal\nAlcohol\nHeroine\nCrank (amphetamine taken nasally)\nCocaine\nCaffeine\nPCP\nMarijuana\nEcstasy\nPsilocybin Mushrooms\nLSD\nMescaline\n\nHope that helps put some perspective on it.\n\nAnything that is addictive, is so because it has a side effect that screws up the nervous system in some way.\n\n1. Cocaine causes rushes of dopamine (used to transmit pleasure sensations between neurons) called a 'high'.\n2. To protect themselves from dopamine rushes the neurons allow dopamine receptors on their membranes to die off.\n3. When a person is not taking cocaine their dopamine levels return to normal but the person feels depressed because the normal levels are absorbed less than normal since the receptors have been reduced.\n4. This causes the person to desire the drug to achieve the pleasure again.\n5. This also means that to achieve the same 'high' as before, larger amounts of cocaine are needed since there are less receptors for it.\n6. The cycle continues until the person quits cold turkey and allows the body to regrow some of the dopamine receptors, but they will never return to the original levels which means the cocaine addict is 'at risk', or addicted at some level for their entire life."

Judaism,  Hell and Purgatory? . What does traditional Judaism thisnks or believes about Hell?\nIs there such a place.? and Purgatory? . A few quotes from the Talmud (Soncino English translation)\nBerachoth 15b\n R. Hama b. Hanina said: If one in reciting the Shemaâ pronounces the letters distinctly, hell is cooled for him, as it says, When the Almighty scattereth kings therein, it snoweth in Zalmon.24 Read not be-fares [when he scattereth] but befaresh [when one pronounces distinctly], and read not be-zalmon [in Zalmon] but be-zalmaweth [in the shadow of death].\n\nSanhedrin 105a\n   Now only Balaam will not enter [the future world], but other [heathens] will enter.27 On whose authority is the Mishnah [taught]? â On R. Joshua's. For it has been taught: R. Eliezer said, The wicked shall be turned into hell, and all the nations that forget God:28 The wicked shall be turned into hell â this refers to transgressors among Israel; and all the nations that forget God â to transgressors among the heathen.29 This is R. Eliezer's view. But R. Joshua said to him: Is it stated, and [those] among all the nations?30 Surely all the nations that forget God is written! But [interpret thus:] The wicked shall be turned into hell, and who are they? â all the nations that forget God.31 Now, that wicked man [Balaam] too gave a sign for himself [that he would not enter the future world by saying, Let me die the death of the righteous32 â meaning, If I die the death of the righteous [i.e., a natural death], my last end will be like his;33 but if not [i.e., if I die a violent death], then behold I go unto my people.34	Society & Culture

why do football players exchange their t-shirts with each other at the end of the match? (soccer)? .  . Respect is the main answer.

The players will remember that day in the future when they look into there closet of collections. Ronaldo is going to swap his with Ashley Cole or Joe Cole most probably because he plays on the Right Wing and Joe Cole or Ashley Cole will have the job to defend him as they work on the left side.

If he has a green card, he is the resident of the U.S. (even though if only the temporary one (2-year green card)). If he wants to keep the Korean citizenship, then he should go to the military. If, however, he wants to become an American citizen, he can ignore the letter and nothing will happen to him. If he already has the green card, he doesn't have to marry a citizen in order to receive his citizenship. 2-year temporary green card is getting replaced with a permanent 10-year green card; and after you have stayed in the U.S. for 5 years like this, you apply for the citizenship and you receive it. \n\nHere what I think is really going on:\nAre you an American citizen?\nHave you ever seen his green card? Do you know how the green cards look like?\nHave you ever seen the ""military"" letter that he has received?\n\nMy personal opinion is that he has no green card and is manipulating you into the marriage in order to get one (!)\nI might be wrong, but in any case: be careful."

Can you fail a drug test if you are taking several prescriptions? . Never use illegal drugs, but I'm afraid my employer will test and get false results because I am on about 5 prescribed meds. . Yes, especially if you are taking a narcotic (pain killer) or some sleeping pills.  Testing positive shouldn't be an automatic reason for termination of employment.  Most people who have a positive test are notified that they tested positive and are allowed to explain that they are on prescription medication.  The employer (or rather the agency that actually performs the test) will then contact your physician for a list of your medications.  If the medications match what you came up positive for (IE if you come up positive for cocaine and you have a prescription for lidocaine) then you will pass and your employer is usually never notified that you were on meds, they will simply be told that you passed.  However, if you test for something that you don't have a current prescription for then you will fail.	Health

property value same as property price? . where looking at buying our first home, and we want to incorporate our car loan and other loans into a mortgage. Most lenders will lend you the money for the property value, does that mean what the price of the property is worth? because some of the homes we have looked at are for quick sale and under the market value, so does that mean we can borrow more to cover costs? . Yes.  If you have instant equity, meaning that you bought a house priced under the value, you can use that equity immediately.  You can take out a line of credit or a second mortgage.  Don't worry because as soon as you move in the offers for loans and credit will come rollin in faster than you read them.	Business & Finance

what were the developments in communication till the 18th century? .  . Well language evolved and became far more efficient.  It began with the pictographs early civilizations typically carved into tablets which were heavy and awkward to transport information on.  Later you had a sort of syllabic system--not individual letters, but symbols for each possible sound combination, for example coo, soo, doo who, fa, ca, la da, and so on.  This was an improvement, particularly coupled with the introduction of papyrus, and sort of paper made from reeds that made recording and transporting information easier still.  Later on, you have the development of an actual alphabet, as we use today, wherein a very small number of characters could be combined to represent all sorts of sounds.  Couple that with the invention of the printing press and you suddenly had a very efficient means of recording and distributing information.	Education & Reference

Rising high to 42 metres, this huge arch is located just opposite to the Rashtrapati Bhawan and gives a clear view of the same. \n\n\nThe Highlights\nThe Amar Jawan Jyoti or the Eternal Flame lies beneath this huge memorial gate, which is major attraction of the area. India Gate is a monument of its kind amidst the expanse of sprawling green lawn. There is one famous boat club and a children's park. The India Gate area becomes lively in the evening with locale people with family and friends taking strolls. Children are seen playing around in the Children's Park and eating ice creams. The monument looks more extravagant during the night than in the daytime for the extensive use of lights.\n\n\n\nThe Architecture\nThis majestic building stands on a low base of red Bharatpur stone, which rises in stages to a huge archway. On the top is inscribed INDIA, flanked by MCM and to the right, XIX. There is a shallow domed bowl at the top that was expected to be filled with burning oil on anniversaries (that is rarely done). This massive archway was designed and built by Lutyens, and originally known as All India War Memorial in memory of the 90,000 Indian soldiers who died in the campaigns of World War I, the North-West Frontier operations of the same time and the 1919 Afghan Fiasco. The names of all the soldiers are inscribed on the walls of the gate.\n\n\nNearby Attractions\nRashtrapati Bhavan (the Presidential Mansion),the Parliament House, the North and South Block are not to be missed. The National Museum showcases an beautiful collection of historical handicrafts.

"Does the 10% tithe have to a church or can it go to any charity and still get credit with God? . I know tithe means ""10% percent given to a church"" but can I give it to any worthwhile charity and still get credit? I have a hard time with all this ""God loves you, but you need to give us money"" stuff. . This is a very valid question and I'm glad you're struggling with it. I've asked the same question myself several times and every time I wrestle for an answer, I'm always led back to what's in my heart. What I mean is that when you're deciding how to give away your ""10%"", you should take a look at what your heart motive is, what your motivation is for giving away your money. \n\nAnd really if your motivation is to ""earn credit"" from God - than I would have to say that your ""donation"" is going to be given in vain. The reason for this is that nothing can be earned from God, we really have no place in trying to earn credit or favor from Him. \n\nSo as you struggle with your question, I would ask you to examine what your motivation is for either tithing or giving to a charity. \n\nI believe the correct motivation would be that you're tithing or donating because you realize that the money in your bank account is not yours in the first place. It is God's and always has been - and you are a steward to what He's given to you to take care of. Remember, being a steward means that you take care of something that is another's with the other owner's best interest in mind. \n\nI know this is a long-winded answer and it may be a lot to take in, but hopefully it at least stirred up some more of that struggling you're going through. You could always pray, too (that always seems to be the best thing to do). =)\n\nBottom line, check yourself, what motivation is on your heart, and you'll be able to discern where to give away your money."

"which allows most weight & min sag at midpoint? steel 8'x6""x3/16"" I-beam with 4"" flng or 8'x 3""x3/16"" sq. tube . The correct response should contain two answers for each product. The maximum weight and the amount of sag at the midpoint of an 8', steel I beam or a 3"" sq. tube . The technical answer to your question is that the moment of inertia of the beam's cross section is greater when speaking of the I-beam, and this means less bending.\n\n\nDumbing it down a little. The I beam will be able to support more weight.  Look at the cross-section of the materials.  The I-Beam has a height of 6 inches.  the square tube has a height of 3 inches.  The bending of a 6"" piece of steel vs 2 3"" pieces along their thickest portions is harder when the material is farther from the midpoint, ie, 6"" is farther than 3"".\n\nAs far as your max deflection and max load are concerned, you need to specify the types of steel, and the type of I-beam would be useful as well (S type, W type), as would the type of square tube (squared corners or rounded).  These won't make a huge difference, but it will make a little."	Science & Mathematics

"Where did the phrase ""Bob's your uncle"" come from? .  . Eric Partridge lists it in his 'Dictionary of Slang', 1937. He gives it the meaning 'all will be well', which is not quite how it is used now. Partridge states it as dating from circa 1890, although he presents no evidence for that. Also he suggests that it may be derived from the phrase 'all is bob', which meant 'all is well'.\n\nAnother interpretation is that it derives from the supposed nepotism of Lord Salisbury. Piers Brendon, in Eminent Edwardians, 1979, writes:\n\n""... in 1887, Balfour was unexpectedly promoted to the vital front line post of Chief Secretary for Ireland by his uncle Robert, Lord Salisbury.""\n\nVarious authors have surmised that having an uncle Bob who was Prime Minister became synonymous with having a passport to an easy life."

"Did any one of you think, if just for a moment, thought that Bush was starting to act like Hitler? .  . Lets look at the similarities between Bush and Hitler. Both were elected/selected, Bush by the Supreme Court and Hitler when Hindenburg died. They both had terrorist attacks on their country, Bush 9/11 and Hitler the Reichstag's fire. Both ignored warning of the impending attacks. Both have/had conspiracy theories about thier involvement. Both blamed foreign ideologues. Both made speeches right afterwords at the site of the attack. Within weeks Bush had the Patriot Act and Hitler had his ""Decree on the Protection of People and State"". Both had a 4 year sunset provision put on them to get them passed. Both had protesters arrested or put in free speech zones away from the place where they were appearing. Both use the word Homeland to describe the nation. Both claim/claimed to be Christian. Both formed a new agency to consolidate various independent police, intelligence and border agencies together. Bush got Homeland Security and Hitler got the Central Security Office. Both have an SS, Bush has the Secret Service as a National Police Force and Hitler had the SchutzStaffel. Both invaded coutries that hadn't attacked them, Hitler invaded Poland and Bush invaded Iraq. Both of their governments described the Geneva Conventions as outdated and quaint.  Both built detention camps outside the country to bypass their laws. Both brought in industry and forged an alliance, and they got former executives of the nation's biggest companies into government positions. Both use government to empower corporations and reward the society's richest individuals, privatize much of the commons, stifle dissent, strip people of constitutional rights, and create an illusion of prosperity through continual and ever-expanding war. \nIs history repeating itself?"

How fast can you get syphilis, right away or it takes a couple of weeks, months or years.? .  . Many people infected with syphilis do not have any symptoms for years, yet remain at risk for late complications if they are not treated. Although transmission appears to occur from persons with sores who are in the primary or secondary stage, many of these sores are unrecognized. Thus, most transmission is from persons who are unaware of their infection.\n\nPrimary Stage\nThe primary stage of syphilis is usually marked by the appearance of a single sore (called a chancre), but there may be multiple sores. The time between infection with syphilis and the start of the first symptom can range from 10 to 90 days (average 21 days). The chancre is usually firm, round, small, and painless. It appears at the spot where syphilis entered the body. The chancre lasts 3 to 6 weeks, and it heals without treatment. However, if adequate treatment is not administered, the infection progresses to the secondary stage.\n\nSecondary Stage\nSkin rash and mucous membrane lesions characterize the secondary stage. This stage typically starts with the development of a rash on one or more areas of the body. The rash usually does not cause itching. Rashes associated with secondary syphilis can appear as the chancre is healing or several weeks after the chancre has healed. The characteristic rash of secondary syphilis may appear as rough, red, or reddish brown spots both on the palms of the hands and the bottoms of the feet. However, rashes with a different appearance may occur on other parts of the body, sometimes resembling rashes caused by other diseases. Sometimes rashes associated with secondary syphilis are so faint that they are not noticed. In addition to rashes, symptoms of secondary syphilis may include fever, swollen lymph glands, sore throat, patchy hair loss, headaches, weight loss, muscle aches, and fatigue. The signs and symptoms of secondary syphilis will resolve with or without treatment, but without treatment, the infection will progress to the latent and late stages of disease.\n\nLate Stage\nThe latent (hidden) stage of syphilis begins when secondary symptoms disappear. Without treatment, the infected person will continue to have syphilis even though there are no signs or symptoms; infection remains in the body. In the late stages of syphilis, it may subsequently damage the internal organs, including the brain, nerves, eyes, heart, blood vessels, liver, bones, and joints. This internal damage may show up many years later. Signs and symptoms of the late stage of syphilis include difficulty coordinating muscle movements, paralysis, numbness, gradual blindness, and dementia. This damage may be serious enough to cause death.	Health

My side of the family wasn't hard to look up, because all of my grandparents are from Italy, and the Catholic church there kept meticulous birth records.\n\nHowever, I don't know how to look up my son's father's side of the family... my son's paternal great-grandmother moved to Chicago from Alabama in the 1940s, where she lives now with her children. \n\nMy son also has one living great-great-grandmother who is 91 years old... she also grew up in Alabama, in the era before civil rights.

We have been working on our ""Roots"" for years.  My great grandfather came from Alabama and his sisters and brothers scattered throughout the US.

We were told that The Mormon's kept records from slavery days so now we're concentrating on finding records at The Mormon's Church.  \n\nKeep in mind, that hte slaves were not educated and they did not spell last names the same.  They would spell and write the way it sound.  That only means that some of the ancester's surnames may have had an ""A"" when others may have had an ""O"".  Could all be sisters and brothers.\n\nSometimes the slavemasters chose to change the last names of some and some may have had the slavemaster's last name.  It's all so complicated.  \n\nI will continue searching. Maybe we can help each other.  gl"	Society & Culture

"What is the difference between the earth atmosphere and that of other planets? . What is the difference between the Earth's atmosphere and that of other planets (Mercury, Pluto, Mars, Venus) that humans don't make ""blopp"". \nSeriously. I mean, on what gases is a human dependant to survive for at least .. say ...0.001 second? On whitch of those planets you can say that there is no vacuum? And what role plays density for that matter? . Oxygen is the gas on which human respiration is dependant. There is a relative abundance of this gas in our atmosphere. Plants (which arrived on Earth before animals) were responsible for ""polluting"" the primeval atmosphere with this highly reactive gas (incidentally the same gas which forms ozone and screens us from deadly high energy radiation from the sun).\n\nI'll quickly run through the rest of the planets: -\n\n1. Mercury.\nHelium atmosphere which is almost nonexistent. Surface  temperatures vary between 350C (day) and minus 170C (night).\nVerdict: - instant death.\n\n2. Venus.\nAtmosphere has large quantities of sulphur dioxide (which smells like rotten eggs or a really bad fart!) and a constant rain of sulphuric acid. Pressure 90 times greater than the Earth's. Temperature of about 500C. Suspected that this is the effect of runaway global warming (heat trapped by carbon dioxide).\nVerdict: - Instant nasty death. The closest physical approximation to Hell.\n\n3. Earth.\nMmmmm. Nice.\n\n4. Mars.\nAtmosphere of mainly carbon dioxide. Atmospheric density fluctuates, but is never enough for liquid water to form in appreciable amounts. Mean surface temperature about minus 27C.\nVerdict: - Temperature and gravity are within tolerances for human life, but needs an oxygen and water transplant. No go (for the present).\n\n5., 6., 7., and 8. Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune.\nThese are all termed ""gas giants"". They all have cores, but at depths within their atmospheres such that surface pressure is enormous. Temperatures of between minus 150C (Jupiter) and minus 220C (Neptune).\nVerdict: - All non-starters.\nAs a piece of trivia, Saturn is the only planet which is less dense than water, which means that if you could find a big enough basin of water, it would float!\n\nAnd finally (phew!) 9. Pluto.\nSmaller than the moon. No atmosphere. Surface temperature minus 230C.\nVerdict: - Waste of time and space. Not even worth the term ""planet"". There are bigger moons than this! Ours for a start!\n\nThe combination of a planet's density and size affect its gravitational attraction. If Earth were denser or larger, its gravitational attraction would increase (ie// you'd weigh more).\nMercury is about the size and density of the moon, so you could probably jump about 10-20 feet in the air quite easily. Mars is less dense but larger than Mercury, and has comparable gravity. Venus is about the same as Earth. Jupiter isn't dense, but could hold about 1,000 Earths, so its gravity is too high for us. The other gas giants, for all their size, are appreciably less dense than Earth, and have gravities not much greater than Earth. And Pluto's so small and insignificant that I reckon if you jumped you could possibly end up in orbit around it.\n\nEarth is the ONLY place in the entire Universe that we know of which has conditions which can sustain life of any sort. If we play a part in altering the atmosphere on this planet the Earth will still exist.It just might not be suitable for life.\n\nFurther answer to your additional response bit: -\n\nIf an astronaut removed his helmet on any planet except Earth he would die almost instantly."

How does the American rating system work for movies? Like, what  makes something rated pg-13 or R or Nc-17? .  . The movie rating system is a voluntary system sponsored by the Motion Picture Association of America and the National Association of Theatre Owners to provide parents with advance information on films, enabling parents to make judgments on movies they want or do not want their children to see. \n\nG - General Audience. All ages admitted. This signifies that the film rated contains nothing most parents will consider offensive for even their youngest children to see or hear. Nudity, sex scenes, and scenes of drug use are absent; violence is minimal; snippets of dialogue may go beyond polite conversation but do not go beyond common everyday expressions. \n\nPG -  Parental Guidance Suggested. Some material may not be suitable for children. This signifies that the film rated may contain some material parents might not like to expose to their young children - material that will clearly need to be examined or inquired about before children are allowed to attend the film. Explicit sex scenes and scenes of drug use are absent; nudity, if present, is seen only briefly, horror and violence do not exceed moderate levels.\n\nPG 13 - Parents Strongly Cautioned. Some material may be inappropriate for children under 13. This signifies that the film rated may be inappropriate for pre-teens. Parents should be especially careful about letting their younger children attend. Rough or persistent violence is absent; sexually-oriented nudity is generally absent; some scenes of drug use may be seen; one use of the harsher sexually derived words may be heard.\n\nR-  Restricted-Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian (age varies in some locations). This signifies that the rating board has concluded that the film rated contains some adult material. Parents are urged to learn more about the film before taking their children to see it. An R may be assigned due to, among other things, a film's use of language, theme, violence, sex or its portrayal of drug use.\n\nNC -17 No One 17 and Under Admitted. This signifies that the rating board believes that most American parents would feel that the film is patently adult and that children age 17 and under should not be admitted to it. The film may contain explicit sex scenes, an accumulation of sexually-oriented language, or scenes of excessive violence. The NC-17 designation does not, however, signify that the rated film is obscene or pornographic.	Entertainment & Music

My husband lies CONSTANTLY about even the most  petty / obvious things, does he need a physiatrist? . Ive finally had it with my husband's lying.

Nothing works, It's almost as though it's uncontrolable for him. \n The other day he bought a gun behind my back, which he's done several times before. I could care less what he buys &  he knows it.

He lies about when he drops off the water payment, whether or not he talked to his mother,what colors he likes; I could go on forver! I've reached the point where I dont ask him anything & when he speaks I dont pay much attention, because I'm so sick of being lied to. Thus we hardly ever speak anymore. Its very hurtful & insulting to me but I CANT leave . Hi, My X use to do the same exact things! I know exactly what it feels like, unfortunately the last few lies I found out were from my children. He was hangin around with a white trash piece of shit that was his sisters friend. He swore up and down they were just friends, come to find out he had been seeing her off and on for about 12 years! I was married to this asshole for 17 of them! Please please... Listen to your heart, especially with his track record.. make sure for yourself and I hope its not true, but that there isn't another woman! I don't know how I didn't find out sooner. I guess the kids were younger..not sure.. But the things you were saying is just how it was with us.. and he didn't even care when we didn't talk I think he actually enjoyed it because there was less to cover up if I wasn't asking him questions! But please keep your eyes and ears open, and I hope you find nothing but just in case hun.. take it from someone who has been there. Take care good luck and if anything changes please keep me informed or if u need another woman to talk to email or im me anytime! Good luck & be strong! Kim	Family & Relationships

The money from  EVERYONE goes to pay that one loss.  \n\nThat's how it is.

what is the theory of realitivity? .  . it means that nothing is absolute. what ever you say is comparative. for example if we say my house is in north it means it is in north from the house which is more in south. however if we go more towards the north pole then my house will be in south. similarly if we are saying that it is hot that means we are comparing with the thing which is a bit cold and it will be cold if we compare it with more hot object. like India is a developed country in south Asia but is a developing country in the world. you may be rich but you are poorer than the world's richest person.

Do you believe in capital punishment?  Would you be willing to execute a woman sentenced to death by the? . courts if you were selected by lot to do so & she would go free if you refused?  Assume you know no details of the trial. . I believe in life in prison without parole for those criminals that have proven to be an ongoing threat to society.  I think it costs us far more to execute them than it would for us to keep them locked up forever.  However, the death sentence does not bother me.  I believe there are people who cannot be changed and that they are evil.  The sex of the person does not enter into it for me.  Would I carry out the execution?  I would not take the job.  If I were forced to do it, or the person would go free?  I would execute them.  My fear in letting them go would be that they would kill again or harm a child.  I couldn't live with that on my conscience.  Anyway I didn't sentence them to die.  I just carried out the sentence of the court.  Of course this answer is based on what I know of the courts of the U.S.A.  I would not carry out a death sentence in another country.  In some cases the sentence may have been handed out simply for being a Christian.	Society & Culture
would anyone know what could be the problem? . with someone who has diabetes with a blood sugar count of 166 and BP of 98/70, the problem is that this person also complains of being very dizzy. And that is where I am stumped I can understand the 166 but I donÂ´t understand the BP and the dizziness. What can it be? . i am a nurse practitioner. something that could be going on is that this BP reading is TOO LOW for this person. they need to see a healthcare professional and be thoroughly evaluated. They will ask questions about normal BP readings for this person, risk for strokes, risk for clogged arteries, and even evaluate for something as simple as excess fluid in the ear. Only someone seeing this person in real life can help well.	Health
"If God loves me more than I love myself, how can there be a hell? . I would never send my wife or my child to hell, and supposedly God loves them more than I ever can.  Therefore, how can he condemn them to hell? . God doesn't want to send anyone to Hell He made Hell for satan and his followers. God doesn't ""send"" you to Hell. You go there because of your sin. And with sin you can't be near God. So you spend eternal separation from Him. God loves you and he wants you to go to heaven but he loved you so much that he gave you the will to choose if you wanted to worship and love him. So before Jesus died for our sins it was very hard to get into heaven. So God died for His world that He created and made a way into heaven. And that is Jesus. The Way, the Truth, and the Light."

How long will you live if you're 84 and have angina?  An honest prognosis please, it's my mother.? .  . Angina is a symptom not a disease.  It simply means pain that is associated with heart disease.  Having angina does not indicate the amount of heart disease only it's presence.  \nMany people who have heart disease control their angina with medications while others have surgery, or a procedure called a cardiac catheterization and balloon angioplasty to relieve their angina.\nI think you need more information.  For example, what is the extent of her heart disease.  Has she had a heart attack?  Does she suffer from something called congestive heart failure. Has she had any procedures/surgeries on her heart?\n\nSummary:  Angina by itself does not indicate how long someone will live or how serious their condition is.	Health
Why chemicals should never be placed directly on the balance pans? . this is  a chemistry laboratory subject . Because chemicals react with eachother, it is bad practice to place chemicals directly on the balance pans.  Residual chemicals from a previous experiment could be resident on the pan, resulting in contamination of your chemical, or worse, an unwanted chemical reaction.  This is why the majority of experiments require glass containers for chemicals.  Most chemicals to not adhere to glass like they might do to metal, and glass can be more easily identified as clean.

"Does anyone out there have any ideas how I can advertise my online business? .  . ""If you build it, they will come"" is not necessarily true on the Web. Putting a website up is one thing, but getting visitors to come to your site is another. The process becomes even more difficult if you have limited resources to market your business.\n\nHere are some shoestring marketing ideas that can help you get the visitors you need at the least cost possible: \n\n1. Create the best content you can with the best products you can possibly offer. Your content is your best advertisement - if visitors love your content, then they will go back and spread the word to others.\n\n2. Make it easy for users to recommend your site. Viral marketing is very important -- and easy to tap on the Web. But give your users the tools. Get a Recommend this Site script from websites such as cgiscripts.com and similar directories of scripts. Some even go as far as giving incentives to those who recommend the site to their friends. If only 10 people go to your site, but these 10 people invite 10 more - that's additional traffic that you get for FREE!\n\n3. Rank well in the search engines (organic search results, not the pay per click). SEs can be a big source of traffic. The key is to create the best content in your niche. If you have good content, other websites will gladly link to you and offer your site as a resource to their audience. Check the on-page factors and be sure to get linked from authority sites in your topic area.\n\nIf you are going to read only one piece on search engine optimization, I suggest you read Brett Tabke of WebmasterWorld.com's ""Successful Site in 12 Months with Google Alone: 26 steps to 15k a day."" http://www.webmasterworld.com/forum3/2010.htm \n\n4. Send out press releases. While outfits charge as much as $650 per release, there are free press release submission places on the Web. Press releases allow you to (a) attract media attention; (b) get more back links to your website without sending each website an email request; and (c) get more visibility especially if your press release gets in Google News or Yahoo News. My website (see my profile) accepts free press release submission (no strings attached!)\n\n5. Submit articles. Write articles and submit them to websites accepting author submissions. You get exposure for your business; establishes you as an authority in your field, and allows you to get backlinks for your website. If 50 websites publish your article and it contains a link back to your website, then you easily get 50 links from a single article. The more links you have, the greater your chances for increasing your search engine rankings.\n\n6. Improve your conversion. Getting visitors is one thing; getting them to buy your products is a whole different story. Read the article ""10 Ways to Convert Visitors to Buyers"" http://www.powerhomebiz.com/072005/conversion.htm for tips on how to improve your conversion rates."	Business & Finance

We just keep waiting for dad to come back. He never will. ( I have tried support groups but they just depress me more) What is the magic secret? . Take this for a grain of salt.\n\nYou're longing for what is no longer here.  We hold on to things, especially one another.  But we are very fragile, and we break easily.  But for some reason we always assume that everything will go well, and are shocked when it doesn't.  You're problem is reconciling the facts with your internal concept of the way things should be.\n\nNot to sound stupid, but remember Forrest Gump and his box of chocolates?  It's kinda like that.  And sometimes the chocolate we take is not what we wanted.  \n\nI think that you are probably in a very sad situation, and your life has been permanently disrupted, and this is what's causing you the most heartache.  You need to take care of you just as much as you take care of him.  JUST AS MUCH!  If that means going away on a vacation by yourself or with friends, then so be it.

why is it that light skinned live in colder climate then darker skinned living in hot climate? . why is it that darker people live in hotter climate then lighter skinned people live in cooler climate when darker color atract more heat? . My guess of why darker people prefer hot climates and light people prefer cooler climates has to do with evolution and genetics.  Pigments have evolved according to exposure to the sun - the lesser intense sun,  the lighter the pigment.  The more exposure to sun and heat,  the darker the pigment.  Darker pigments tolerate more heat and exposure.  A light-skinned person would fry much sooner in a desert than a dark-skinned person.  (Although dark skin DOES burn).  I've studied very little biology and anthropology,  so,  don't know for sure.   Humans will evolve to being all about the same color in a few million years, anyway.  Don't worry about it.

The harder you strike the notes on the keyboard, the more impact the hammers have on the strings - which makes it a percussion instrument.\n\nHere is a good link that has tons of good information on this:\n\nhttp://exhibits.pacsci.org/music/Instruments.html	Entertainment & Music

What is the signifigance of Pi and how did the Greeks (or whomever) discover it/recognize it's importance? .  . Pi is the ratio of a circle's diameter to its circumference as well as the ratio of the circle's area to a square with the same sidelength as its radius. This made Pi useful to many ancient societies, as the circle is the shape that encloses the largest area with a given circumference, so we don't really know who formulated the importance of Pi first. \nDue to the n-dimensional circle (n-sphere) being a model for periodic phenomena, a natural way of measuring angles (the radian and steradian are inspired by the 1- and 2-sphere respectively) and homeomorphisms of the n-dimensional ball being important in differential geometry and manifold theory (integrals of forms over spheres are common in physics), Pi shows up almost everywhere in modern mathematics and physics.

"when was computer discovered and who did it? . Like who invented it, how, the date, etc. . Originally, the term ""computer"" referred to a person who performed numerical calculations under the direction of a mathematician, possibly with the aid of a variety of mechanical calculating devices such as the abacus onward. Examples of early calculating devices, the first ancestors of the computer, included the abacus and the Antikythera mechanism, an ancient Greek device for calculating the movements of planets, dating from about 87 BCE.[1] The end of the Middle Ages saw a reinvigoration of European mathematics and engineering, and Wilhelm Schickard's 1623 device was the first of a number of European engineers to construct a mechanical calculator.[2]\n\nCharles Babbage was the first to conceptualize and design a fully programmable computer as early as 1820, but due to a combination of the limits of the technology of the time, limited finance, and an inability to resist tinkering with his design, the device was never actually constructed in his lifetime. A number of technologies that would later prove useful in computing, such as the punch card and the vacuum tube had appeared by the end of the 19th century, and large-scale automated data processing using punch cards was performed by tabulating machines designed by Hermann Hollerith.\n\nDuring the first half of the 20th century, many scientific computing needs were met by increasingly sophisticated, special-purpose analog computers, which used a direct mechanical or electrical model of the problem as a basis for computation. These became increasingly rare after the development of the programmable digital computer.\n\nA succession of steadily more powerful and flexible computing devices were constructed in the 1930s and 1940s, gradually adding the key features of modern computers, such as the use of digital electronics (largely invented by Claude Shannon in 1937)[3] and more flexible programmability. Defining one point along this road as ""the first computer"" is exceedingly difficult. Notable achievements include the Atanasoff-Berry Computer (1937), a special-purpose machine that used valve-driven (vacuum tube) computation, binary numbers, and regenerative memory; the secret British Colossus computer (1944), which had limited programmability but demonstrated that a device using thousands of valves could be made reliable and reprogrammed electronically; the American ENIAC (1946) â which was the first really general purpose machine, but still used the decimal system and had an inflexible architecture that meant reprogramming it essentially required it to be rewired, and Konrad Zuse's Z machines, with the electromechanical Z3 (1941) being the first working machine featuring automatic binary arithmetic and feasible programability.\n\nThe team who developed ENIAC, recognizing its flaws, came up with a far more flexible and elegant design, which has become known as the stored program architecture, which is the basis from which virtually all modern computers were derived. A number of projects to develop computers based on the stored program architecture commenced in the late 1940s; the first of these were completed in Britain. The first to be up and running was the Small-Scale Experimental Machine, but the EDSAC was perhaps the first practical version that was developed.\n\n \nThe Apple II, an early personal computerValve-driven computer designs were in use throughout the 1950s, but were eventually replaced with transistor-based computers, which were smaller, faster, cheaper, and much more reliable, thus allowing them to be commercially produced, in the 1960s. By the 1970s, the adoption of integrated circuit technology had enabled computers to be produced at a low enough cost to allow individuals to own a personal computer of the type familiar today.\n\n[edit]\nHow computers work: the stored program architecture\nWhile the technologies used in computers have changed dramatically since the first electronic, general-purpose, computers of the 1940s, most st"	Computers & Internet

No penis is ever too big or too small, but I'm sure some people may be more intimidated by anything bigger (as a 5'5"" girl, people who are 6'5"" plus are a bit intimidating too!). The average vagina is about 6 inches deep, so if having vaginal sex, make sure you don't try to go all the way in; you'll be poking her in the cervix and that can cause some painful cramping, etc.  Having sex in a real entry (""doggy style"") position can make it easier, as the vagina can open up more when positioned as such (and as always, the more turned on a woman is, the less anything hurts, as the muscles are less tensed up, so make sure she's not nervous, and is having fun as well).

Is Tibet its own country? . I am confused - is Tibet its own country? Or is it part of China?  I have tried to find an answer on the internet - but its very confusing - nothing spells it out and makes it simple. \nIs Tibet somewhere an American can go to visit, like for vacation?\nCan someone help? \nThanks in advance! . Many people would like to believe that Tibet is its own country, however, because they remained isolated from the world powers for so long, did not have sovereignty clearly recognized by world powers, and did not have a unified political and geographical area, it is truly difficult to say, factually, that Tibet was its own country. Consequently, when it was annexed by China, there was little force behind the government's claim that it was sovereign and thus, they received no help from foreign governments. So, Tibet is technically part of China and is recognized as such by every government in the world.\n\nAmericans can certainly visit Tibet. It is not dangerous, nor is it difficult. You book a tour, just like you would for anywhere else, then your tourist agency arranges the proper permits, and you get on a plane and fly there. I am an American in Tibet. I am studying at the university in Lhasa--no problems whatsoever. The only stipulation is that you abide by Chinese rules while you are visiting, and don't cause any problems. No big deal.

How does exposure to radioactive elements cause cancer? .  . As the radioactive elements decay, they emit high-energy particles that go crashing through the cell(s). These particles hit atoms within the cell, creating either ions that go on to damage the cell's DNA, or they hit and directly damage the DNA. Once their DNA is damaged, cells usually either repair the damage, or if they can't, commit suicide (called apoptosis). Only those cells that have been damaged and fail to repair it and fail to commit suicide can become cancerous. Of course, the final requirement is that the DNA is damaged in an area that controls cell replication is such a way as to allow the unchecked proliferation of the cell.	Science & Mathematics

You might communicate with someone who you get on so well with that you go and meet them, and it goes on from there.\n\nI guess the flipside is that there are probably people you'd be compatible with who leave very near you, who you don't get to meet at all.\n\nIsn't that funny (or annoying)!

"What is wrong with parents? . Why do we sing ""Rock a bye baby"" to lull our little ones to sleep when the song is about putting your baby in a tree and letting the wind crash the cradle to the ground? . Walk the floor with a teething baby for three hours and the kid is lucky if that's all your singing. But look at all the nursery rhymes and you will find that they are, for the most part, political statements of the day. Little Jack Horner was an embezzler. Mary, Mary, quite contrary was Mary Queen of Scots who butchered anyone she even thought might betray her. London Bridge is falling down was actually about London Bridge crumbling because of lack of repair and misuse of funds. Ring around the rosy is about the plague and herbs people used to carry in hopes of warding off the disease. Do a web search on nursery rhymes and you'll learn lots of good stuff."

"Should municipal building inspectors be excluded from liability when buildings later prove defective? .  . This is a question of allocation of risk and responsibility.  It also involves the question of whether the government should be put in the position of being an insurer for the building industry.\n\nBuilding inspectors are not on site continously.  They show up at specified points in the process.  A shoddy contractor can hide defective work under well done work and pass the inspection.  Also, buildinng inspectors have to assume that the materials meet specifications.  So, if the specs call for 3/8"" rebar and the contracter used 1/4"" rebar the inspector might not catch it.\n\nIf you make the city liable for not catching the contractor's mistakes, the city will be forced to have to have inspectors on site all the time.  This would be very, very expensive and would slow down the work horrendeously.\nThe city would have to increase the cost of a permit to cover not only the extra cost of having to have a trained inspector at every buildinng site all  thetime (I doubt there are that many trained inspectors) but also to cover the possibility that some jury, sometime with 20/20 hindsight and no other solvent defendant is going to give someone a judgment against the city for either (a) the cost of tearing down and rebuilding a ""defective"" buildion or (b) someone's expected lifetime earnings lost when the building fell on him/her, or (c) both.  I guarantee you that the building owner and contractor are bankrupt or have settled by the time the case gets into court leaving the City as the only remaining defendant.\n\nOff the top of my head, I would guess building permits would be 25% - 50% of the total project cost if the City has to carry the liability and extra manpower.  I may be off by 10% either way, but you would be looking at a ten to hundred fold increase in the cost of a permit. and the cost of the completed building.\n\nTaxpayers, being the persons who vote in the elected officials, don't like being the ones holding hte bag.  As a result every juridiction I know of shields the building inspector and his/her employer, the taxpayer, from liability."	Politics & Government
military women out there......help me please? . my fiance is going over seas soon. i'm canadian and he's american, i was wondering where i should go to be with other military women like myself. or am i stuck in canada forever and ever and ever? what do you do when you think you can't take it anymore? . Try to contact his FRG (family readiness group). They can keep you up-to-date with what is going on with the unit. However, some units have restrictions on who can receive information, and there may be certain things they can't/won't tell you (since you are not married yet). There should be some people who you can make friends with and talk to though. If moving is an option, move near his base so that you can really be near the FRG and also be there when he  gets back. However, you cannot live on the base until you are married, and the military will not pay you an allowance to live off-base, like they would if  you were married. \n\nWhen you think you can't take it anymore, remember why you love him. It sucks when he's gone, but it will be so worth it when he gets home, trust me.	Politics & Government

"I work with a girl that has the worst grammar EVER!!!! Should I correct her.? .  . That's a toughie!!!  It really depends on your position.  Are you in any way above her or responsible for her performance?  If so, definately yes.  You have the right and responsibility to correct her.  If you are simply co-workers....no; unless her duties and yours intertwine in such a way that you could be mistakenly blamed for her carelessness.  Poor grammar could be due to lack of intellect or laziness.  Not much you can do about either.  If the two of you are somewhat friends, you could try using light humor as an attempt to correct her.  If not, then any real attempt at correcting her will only breed resentment and ill-will.  You may even end up a laughingstock as the ""grammar police"".  Best advice, assuming that you're not her superior, just leave it alone.  Eventually the boss will realize that she's not that bright.  However, if she's doing her job and doing it well, nothing may come of it.  If that's the case, you need to leave your pet peeve at the door.  Good Luck"	Business & Finance

"Any other Christians ever feel awkward about God and angels always seeing and being with you? . You know, like if you're going to the bathroom, in the shower, changing clothes, stuff like that. . God is not a man.

You see the baby as an innocent creature.\nThat's how God sees His children.\nHe knows all things even before we do so why not trust in Him and not worry about the physical aspects of our being. Whenever this thought comes up again, rebuke the devil and say ""Get lost Satan!""\nAnd never think that God doesn't understand that we are human beings, for He made us.\nAngels are not human beings.

How dou you make plastic? . School Report + Testing this Question thingy . Well plastic is a polymer.  A polymer is a big huge molecule that is made up of repeats of smaller molecules linked together.  You can think of it like a train.  The polymer is the whole train and each of the smaller units is a car in the train.  To make plastic, you perform the chemical reactions that link the train cars together.  Then you perform some process to shape the plastic into the object you want.  Usually that process involves hot plastic that you just made and a mold that you put the hot plastic into.  There are many different types of plastic and the differences between them are which train cars are used in the train and how they are linked together.	Science & Mathematics

Which banks in illinois do not use chexsystems? .  . Perhaps you have made some mistakes in your past with your banking account, and have ended up on Chexsystem's database. It will be very difficult to open a new bank account because 80% of all banks are using their systems to verify your banking history. Not only that, but you will remain in the system for a period of 5 years. My advice would be to perhaps go to a smaller bank. One of those local banks that may only have 1-2 branches in your area. The larger the bank, the better chance that it will be using Chexystems to verify all new applicants. There really is no way to know though, unless you contact the bank. You can also check out the Chexsystems consumer website https://www.consumerdebit.com/consumerinfo/us/en/index.htm and get more information on how they work and tips on how to avoid ending up in their system in the future.

Is van Basten a total idiot??? . This new coach for Holland is a bonafide, 100 percent MORON! I am ready to take all my Oranje memorabilia and throw it in the trash can. How can ANY coach keep the Oranje icon DAVIDS off the national side??? Especially fielding such a young team this year! It is imbecilic. This guy should be fired post haste before he gets a single chance to ruin Holland's bid for World Cup glory, which I am now certain will not happen without a veteran like DAVIDS to steady the ship. This ranks with the worst decisions I have ever seen in sports. I know he was coming off an inhury, but is playing now and there is certainly time to get match-fit for the World Cup, a stage Davids has long dominated!!! Bring in Hiddinck. Bring back Advocaat. Anybody but this know-nothing running the show now!!! Holland won't get out of that group. That much is now clear. . this is what is dutch football is all about - utter controversy.\n\nbut i prefer to be patient with van Basten and give him a chance. at least he is acting differently by eliminating the so-called star footballers (with a ego heavier than their body weight) and promising the upcoming footballers to the stardom (provided they display their worth in the 2006 Germany).\n\ncheers.

In which lane on a 1/4 mile track do you havo to run in to equal the 1/4 mile? Inside, outside, or middle? .  . The fact is that you can run IN ANY LANE on a track to equal 1/4 mile. The difference is where you start. The inside lane is exactly 1/4 mile (or 400m, depending on the track). Each of the other lanes have a stagger where you would have to begin to run, otherwise you would be running further than in lane one. If you watch a track race on TV, (like the 400m) you'll notice runners with a starting position ahead of the runner in lane one. It appears that they have a head-start, but the distance is the same. The reason is that the outside lanes are actually longer the further out they go, so to compensate, they start further up the track and they all end at the same finish line.	Sports

How do you tell your parents your atheist at 15 years old? . my friends parents are forcing her to go to church, but they dont know shes atheist and shes afraid to tell them, how should she approach it . I'm an atheist too, but on occasion (Christmas, Easter, etc)I go to church with my parents (who only know that I'm not a Christian) because it's part of what we do as a family and also part of our culture (though not a very good part, I think). \n\nAt 15, it's not necessary for your friend to cause a ruckus with her parents, and she may well bring a whole host of problems down on herself - as a minor they can do a lot of things to her that she *really* wouldn't like - and depending on how fundamentalist they are, such actions may not be too far fetched.\n\nI suggest that she simply bring her skeptical viewpoint to church with her and view the whole thing as a learning situation until she either turns 18 or moves out of the house. Not believing in god doesn't require active proselytizing (unlike religion). Eyes and ears open, mouth shut (for a while).	Society & Culture

Your hobbies, skills, and experiences are extremely important but even the greatest of ideas won't work if you cannot fill or create a market for your product and/or service. What do people in your area want from a business? What are people spending their money on now? What can you do that few other people want to do, can do, have the equipment to do, and mainly have the money to buy or have done? There are many variables. Once you concentrate on ONE thing, give it 100% of your efforts. Be aware that partnerships are extremely difficult to stay working in and has been responsible for many lost friends. Be clear on who does what. When you decide what to do, get a business plan. If you cannot invest the time into writing a business plan you won't be able to find the time to run the business. I know that I am not answering your question directly but you've got to know what you want to do, what people want, and you have to research the competition.

Good luck all!\n\nOh btw, I will not count copied and pasted part from any religious books. Put it in plain english. Clear and concise. . The best advice is to find and speak with a knowledgeable rabbi.  Here are some genralities:\n\n\n1. Do a lot of reading.  Think about the various ""streams"" of Orthodox vs Conservative vs Reform vs Reconstructionist, and decide which of these best fits you.\n\n2.  Having done so, visit several nearby synagogues within the stream you have chosen and speak with the chief rabbi. You should then choose which of these rabbis you want to work with.\n\n3.  The rabbi will lay out a course of study for you, but will probably start by asking why you want to become a Jew by Choice.\n\n4. You will take the course of study the rabbi proposes.\n\n5. Meanwhile you will attend synagogue services, and you will learn various rituals.\n\n6. You will attend various discussion groups with people also becoming Jews by Choice.\n\n7. You will take a final exam, and you will make various commitments.\n\n8. A male would probably need to be circumcized if he is not already.  A woman may need to be immersed in a bath called a mikveh.\n\n9. You may need to appear before a group of scholars and answer their questions.\n\nJews do not actively try to ocnvert non-Jews.  However, it is a wonderful thing for the Jewish Community when someone voluntarily decides to become a Jew by Choice.  The clergy and the Jewish Community will welcome you with open arms and do everything we can to help you succeed.

Yet, we see GOD Almighty Commanding His servants to not only kill the enemy's men, but also the innocent children and non-virgin women who have not done anything to anyone:\n\n1 Samuel 15:2-4\n2 Thus saith the LORD of hosts, I remember that which Amalek did to Israel, how he laid wait for him in the way, when he came up from Egypt. \n3 Now go and smite Amalek, and utterly destroy all that they have, and spare them not; but slay both man and woman, infant and suckling, ox and sheep, camel and a*s. \n4 And Saul gathered the people together, and numbered them in Telaim, two hundred thousand footmen, and ten thousand men of Judah.\n\n""Now kill all the boys [innocent kids]. And kill every woman who has slept with a man, but save for yourselves every girl who has never slept with a man. (Numbers 31:17-18)\n\nAnyone care to explain why the terror?? . do you know what would've happened if they didn't do that?  i don't, but i'm sure god does... he has his reasons, he would rather kill off some people than let his own people die.... the ends justify the means"	Society & Culture
"Coping with cancer ( part 2 to your feelings on having encountered the illness for the first time).? . All your replies are truly outstanding and am really glad to see that there are still many who are willing to fight the biggest of odds s  against them and emerging the winners. It is truly admirable and wish if you'll could each mail me with your stories so as to give me more insight to cancer as others view it. I have my own views and would like to see how they reflect on mine. I was dignosed with cancer in the final stage and was not given a chance to surivive. I am still alive after six years and though the cancer has left behind some traumatic scars - which I accepted in no time and now live a very happy life-  watching my sons grow, wooing my wife ( who would never ever see me as I was foreven travelling!) and falling in love!

No eyebrows.  My eyes drip continually. I have carpal tunnel. Hot flashes galore. Osteoporosis.  All from chemo. I did not enjoy not being able to taste anything.  Or the fact my fingernails hurt so bad I could not touch anything without pain. I did not like getting pnemonia every year.  Or catching every little virus that rolled my way.  No one tells you all the crap that is going to happen afterwards.  The doctor said if they did no one would get treatment.  He told me it could be 3-5 years before my immune system is up.  Well I am much better now and I do not get sick as much. I do still everyday live with the watering eyes,ect. ect.  It caused relationship problems with my family. They just really could not deal with how I looked.  My husband however is the best husband on the earth now.  I am glad to be alive.  I do believe cancer woke me up to the realization of who is truly there for you. I stand up for myself more. Don't put up with all the daily drama.  I am not so happy go lucky as I used to be.

"What xactly is black friday,and where did the saying come from? .  . BLACK FRIDAY (SHOPPING) - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Friday_Sale\nFrom Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\n\nBlack Friday, the day after Thanksgiving in the United States, is historically one of the busiest retail shopping days of the year. Many consider it the ""official"" beginning to the holiday season. Most retailers will open very early and usually provide massive discounts on their products.\n\nAlthough Black Friday is typically the busiest shopping day of the year in terms of customer traffic, it is not typically the day with the highest sales volume. That is usually either Christmas Eve or the last Saturday before Christmas.\n\nOrigin\n\nThe first use of this term to describe the day after Thanksgiving is not exactly known. There are two popular theories as to its origin.\n\nAccounting practice\n\nOne theory is that stores traditionally operated at a financial loss for most of the year (January through November) and made their profit during the holiday season. When this would be recorded in the financial records, common accounting practices use red ink to show negative amounts and black ink would show positive amounts. Black Friday is the beginning of the period where they would no longer have losses (the red) and instead take in the year's profits (the black).\n\nStress from large crowds\n\nAnother theory comes from the fact that shopping experience on this day can be extremely stressful. The term is used as a comparison to the extremely stressful and chaotic experience of Black Thursday or other black days. According to The Word Spy:\n\nEarliest Citation:\nChristmas decorations around Tampa Bay started going up in late October, and business has been brisk since then. And while Friday--known as Black Friday for the legendary hordes--will be the biggest shopping day for many area stores, others ring up the greatest sales the Saturday before Christmas.\nâMarilyn Marks, ""Retailers expect good sales this Christmas,"" St. Petersburg Times, November 27, 1986\n\nThere exists an earlier reference, speaking to the Friday after Thanksgiving:\n\nA BLACK FRIDAY.\nThere have been many Black Fridays in recent history. Most of them have been days of financial panic. There has been none of blacker foreboding than last Friday. And the blackness is not loss or fear of loss in stocks and bonds.\nNew York Times (1857-Current file).\nNew York, N.Y.: Dec 3, 1922. pg. 38, 1 pgs\nISSN/ISBN 03624331\n\nEmployees of retail stores have for years referred to Black Friday in a satirical way, to note the extremely stressful and hectic nature of the day. Heavy traffic and customer demands added to the long hours make it a difficult day.\n\n\nBlack Friday on the Internet\n\nAdvertisements in advance\n\nCertain websites such as DealTaker.com offer information about Black Friday deals up to a month in advance. The text listings of prices are usually accompanied by adscans -- complete PDFs either leaked by insiders, or intentionally released by large retailers to give consumers insight and allow them time to plan.\n\nCyber Monday\n\nThe term Cyber Monday refers to the Monday immediately following Black Friday, which unofficially marks the beginning of the holiday online shopping season.\n\nIn recent years, Cyber Monday has become a busy day for online retailers, with some sites offering low prices and other promotions on that day.\n\nControversy\n\nResponse (Buy Nothing Day)\n\nAnti-consumer frenzy protesters have chosen this day as Buy Nothing Day in North America, where those concerned about the increasing power and influence of consumer corporations are urged to not make consumer purchases.\n\nDMCA\n\nIn recent years, some retailers (including Wal-Mart, Target Corporation, Best Buy, and Staples, Inc.) have claimed that the advertisements they send in advance of Black Friday and the prices included in those advertisement are intellectual property and protected by the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA).\n\nUsing the t"	Education & Reference

"Follow-up question to mystery noise: how can I reduce the following acoustic sound? . how can I reduce the following acoustic sound?\n\n\n\n------------------------------------------------\n\nMystery resonation sound when my computer is running?\n\nThe resonation is definitely not from the computer itself, but from within the walls of the apartment, which have very bad insulation and thin walls. The sound is a mid-range vibration (?) that comes and goes. I don't think its an echo because its not perfectly uniform, and the computers sound is uniform. But the sound disappears once the computer is turned off.\n\nWhat is the computer causing to vibrate or produce sound - is it electrical wire, or just some weird acoustic resonance?\n\nBest Answer - Chosen By You\n\nI go with acoustic resonance. The cooling fan(s) in your computer are creating noise. This is approximately ""white"" or Gaussian noise -- all frequencies. But, your room and hollow walls are resonant. A certain frequency and its harmonics are such that sound waves of these frequencies bounce back and forth between the walls and . Put stuff in your room to absorb sound and break up the waves.  Kind of depends on your budget and how permanent the modifications.  Think thick and absorbent -- heavy curtains, tapestries/wall hangings, large cushions, beanbag chairs, large potted plants, upholstered furniture, carpeting, acoustic tiles or acoustic coating on the ceiling, and cork board are some ideas.\n\nIf you are willing to spend money there are commercial solutions.  Here is one example:\n\nhttp://www.soundprooffoam.com/acoustic.html\n\nIf you could provide the dimensions of the room (length, width, height) and the approximate frequency of the vibration it might be helpful.  You said ""midrange"".  Is that like a woman's voice -- around 400 Hz?  I'm wondering if there is a standing wave in the room (should be able to calculate the resonant frequency of the room given its dimensions) or if some object in the room is being stimulated to vibrate.  The later would be analogous to running your finger around the edge of a crystal goblet and causing the goblet to ""sing"" -- like the old ""Is it live or is it Memorex"" commercials.  :)\n\nIs it possible that the vibrartion is mechanical?  Perhaps a fan is out of balance.  Vibration from the fan could be transmitted through the computer case to the desk causing the desk to vibrate.  A simple experiment, pick up the computer and see if the sound goes away."	Science & Mathematics

"how far can you push a horse to race? .  . If by this you mean, what are the longest distances that racehorses run, it depends.\n\nMany steeplechase and hurdle races are run over distances in excess of 3 miles.  The horses aren't running at the same speed as horses in shorter flat races, but they are running at a good galloping pace.\n\nThere are flat races at distances up to two miles, but the trend is towards shorter races.  Most races in America are at distances of less than a mile, and the six-furlong race (that's 3/4 of a mile) is a staple of most race tracks.  Nowadays 1-1/4 miles is considered to be a long race, and something like the San Juan Capistrano at Santa Anita is considered a ""marathon"" at 1-3/4 miles.\n\nIn the 1800's, races at 4 miles, conducted in heats, weren't uncommon.  The typical format was the horse that won 2 out of three heats was the winner.  So in that case a horse might run 8 miles.\n\nIn endurance racing, horses ""race"" over great distances, but not at a gallop.  In the Tevis Cup Race in California, which is 100 miles over some very tough, mountainous terrain, the winner typically completes the couse in under 13 hours elapsed time.  (There are mandatory rest stops, which are not included in the elapsed time, which is the time the horse and rider spend on the trail.)  Some horses have completed the course in just over 11 hours."

Why is the sky blue? .  . The sky is blue because of the Rayleigh scattering of light by gas molecules in the atmosphere.  Since nitrogen, oxygen and other molecules are much smaller than the wavelength of light, they exhibit Rayleigh scattering.  Wavelength is related in the electromagnetic spectrum (from low to high): blue, violet, green, yellow, orange, red.  A simplification of the equation that describes Rayleigh scattering is below.  The shortes wavelengths are most efficiently scattered and so the sky appears blue for most of the day.  Coincidentally, this is why sunsets appear red - blue light is scattered elsewhere.\n\nAlso, particles whose diameters are small, but close to the wavelength of light exhibit Mie scattering.  This type of scattering is equally efficient throughout the spectrum and is why clouds appear white when the sun shines off of them.	Science & Mathematics

"Starting an LLC with out an attorney, what is the best way to go about doing this? . Do you have any links to the websites that have the paperwork, any tips or suggestions, pitfalls, or any notes of experience on how hard or easy this is, how long the process takes, and cost...thanks for any advice or help. . Forming a limited liability company (LLC) is easy. Here are the steps you need to take to make your LLC a legal reality.\n\n1.Choose an available business name that complies with your state's LLC rules. \n2. File formal paperwork, usually called articles of organization, and pay the filing fee (ranging from $40 to $900, depending on the state). \n3. Create an LLC operating agreement, which sets out the rights and responsibilities of the LLC members. \n4. Publish a notice of your intent to form an LLC (required in only a few states). \n5. Obtain licenses and permits that may be required for your business. \n\nChoosing a Name for Your LLC\n---------------------------------------\nThe name of your LLC must comply with the rules of your state's LLC division. (Typically, this office is combined with the corporations division, and is part of the department or secretary of state's office.) While requirements differ from state to state, generally:\n\n---the name cannot be the same as the name of another LLC on file with the LLC office \n---the name must end with an LLC designator, such as ""Limited Liability Company"" or ""Limited Company,"" or an abbreviation of one of these phrases (such as ""LLC,"" ""L.L.C.,"" or ""Ltd. Liability Co."")\n---the name cannot include certain words prohibited by the state, such as Bank, Insurance, Corporation or City (states differ widely on prohibited terms). \n\nYour state's LLC office can tell you how to check if your proposed name is available for your use. Often, for a small fee, you can reserve your LLC name for a short period of time until you file your articles of organization.\n\nBesides following your state's LLC naming rules, you must make sure your name won't violate another company's trademark.\n\nOnce you've found a legal and available name, you don't usually need to register it with your state. When you file your articles of organization, your business name will be automatically registered.\n\nFiling Articles of Organization\n-----------------------------------------\nAfter settling on a name, you must prepare and file ""articles of organization"" with your state's LLC filing office. While most states use the term ""articles of organization"" to refer to the basic document creating an LLC, some states (including Delaware, Mississippi, New Hampshire, New Jersey, and Washington) use the term ""certificate of formation."" Two other states (Massachusetts and Pennsylvania) call the document a ""certificate of organization.""\n\nFiling Fees:\nOne disadvantage of forming an LLC instead of a partnership or a sole proprietorship is that you'll have to pay a filing fee when you submit your articles of organization. In most states, the fees are modest -- typically around $100. In a few others, they take a bigger bite: consider California ($70, plus an $800 annual tax), Illinois ($500), and Massachusetts ($500).\n\nRequired Information:\nArticles of organization are short, simple documents.

Why do i keep seeing on here we're a christian country .? . But the Churches are struggling.Hardly anyone helps anyone anymore.bith rates is going up amonst the single girls .worse in europe.being born white does'nt automaticly make you a christain..if you was stop a 100 people infact try this ask 10 people you know to say the lords pray and see how many don't know it ..So can anyone tell me how is it a christian country .when young kids think chrismas is for presents only and don't know the real reason.If you could only watch 3 programs x-factor big brother or songs of praise .Who would choose song of praise..I would like some real answers please .not just insults or thumbs down .or how bad Muslims are doing .I'm not intrested in muslims and i don't mean that as a put down either . . This is a complex question but in short I think that most people still cling to the idea of us being a christian country because to say otherwise would indicate that we are a faithless nation. I think that the majority of people in the country still believe in God even though the traditional ways of worship have declined drastically.	Society & Culture

"Punctuation: How do you decide how many question marks or exclamation points you choose to use? . Whether you're asking a question or emoting dramatically, what's your personal criteria for how much punctuation is necessary to make your point? I've seen people in YA string together endless ?????? or !!!!!! or sometimes both together ?!?!?!?!?!?! Beyond the fact this violates basic rules of grammar and punctuation usage, I'm curious as to why people feel the need to do this and how they arrive at whatever number of question marks or exclamation points they use for emphasis?! Please share? Thanks! ;)\n\n(Btw, I could find no evidence of a writing or grammar category or subcategory... why's that?) . I think you are quite correct in saying that, technically speaking, one of whichever mark it is should be enough.  However, e-mails take the form of shortened means of contact; neither a letter nor a phone call and not even a mobile phone text message, they combine elements of all three. Even you have used an emoticon [ ;) ] which was a device unheard of in pen and paper days but is now commonly accepted.\n\nTo some degree, it's a good thing - most people wouldn't go to the trouble of writing a letter nowadays, with frequent revisions before it is finally edited into an acceptable form.  Then you have to find a stamp and a letterbox to post the darn thing, and that always assumes that the postal service will pick it up sometime within the next 24 hours, and - if they feel so inclined - deliver it for you any time within the next forty years. Typing an e-mail which can be edited as you go along, immediately despatched and replied to in the same day at least gets people off their phones for a while. (Until they are on a bus or in a restaurant when phone calls must be compulsorily made on their mobiles.)\n\nStrings of endless exclamation marks or question marks usually denote incredulity, and the more there are the more unbelievable the writer finds the statement or question to be. ""Do you ~really~ believe the moon is made of green cheese????  Oh, come on!!!!!!""\n\n(With regard to your parenthetical question, the answer is probably because most people wouldn't know how to parse a sentence these days; grammar per se is not taught in many schools.  Children are supposed to absorb the technique through observational osmosis, I think, and from the standard of much of what passes for children's literature - or television, which are the two main influences - they don't really have much chance!)"

"how come people are so fuckky? .  . 1.Because they don't know God.\n2.Because we don't understand them;\n3.Because they didn't have a teacher like Mrs. Thompson:\n\nA Teacher's Lesson \nThere is a story many years ago of an elementary teacher. Her name was Mrs. Thompson. And as she stood in front of her 5th grade class on the very first day of school, she told the children a lie. Like most teachers, she looked at her students and said that she loved them all the same. \n\nBut that was impossible, because there in the front row, slumped in his seat, was a little boy named Teddy Stoddard. Mrs. Thompson had watched Teddy the year before and noticed that he didn't play well with the other children, that his clothes were messy and that he constantly needed a bath. And Teddy could be unpleasant. \nIt got to the point where Mrs. Thompson would actually take delight in marking his papers with a broad red pen, making bold X's and then putting a big ""F"" at the top of his papers. \n\nAt the school where Mrs. Thompson taught, she was required to review each child's past records and she put Teddy's off until last. However, when she reviewed his file, she was in for a surprise. \n\nTeddy's first grade teacher wrote, ""Teddy is a bright child with a ready laugh. He does his work neatly and has good manners...he is a joy to be around.""\nHis second grade teacher wrote, ""Teddy is an excellent student, well liked by his classmates, but he is troubled because his mother has a terminal illness and life at home must be a struggle."" \n\nHis third grade teacher wrote, ""His mother's death has been hard on him. He tries to do his best but his father doesn't show much interest and his home life will soon affect him if some steps aren't taken."" \n\nTeddy's fourth grade teacher wrote, ""Teddy is withdrawn and doesn't show much interest in school. He doesn't have many friends and sometimes sleeps in class.""\nBy now, Mrs. Thompson realized the problem and she was ashamed of herself. She felt even worse when her students brought her Christmas presents, wrapped in beautiful ribbons and bright paper, except for Teddy's. His present which was clumsily wrapped in the heavy, brown paper that he got from a grocery bag. \n\nMrs. Thompson took pains to open it in the middle of the other presents. Some of the children started to laugh when she found a rhinestone bracelet with some of the stones missing, and a bottle that was one quarter full of perfume. But she stifled the children's laughter when she exclaimed how pretty the bracelet was, putting it on, and dabbing some of the perfume on her wrist. \n\nTeddy Stoddard stayed after school that day just long enough to say, ""Mrs. Thompson, today you smelled just like my Mom used to."" After the children left she cried for at least an hour. On that very day, she quit teaching reading, and writing, and arithmetic. Instead, she began to teach children.. \n\nMrs. Thompson paid particular attention to Teddy. As she worked with him, his mind seemed to come alive. The more she encouraged him, the faster he responded. By the end of the year, Teddy had become one of the smartest children in the class and, despite her lie that she would love all the children the same, Teddy became one her ""teacher's pets."" \n\nA year later, she found a note under her door, from Teddy, telling her that she was still the best teacher he ever had in his whole life. Six years went by before she got another note from Teddy. He then wrote that he had finished high school, third in his class, and she was still the best teacher he ever had in his whole life. \n\nFour years after that, she got another letter, saying that while things had been tough at times, he'd stayed in school, had stuck with it, and would soon graduate from college with the highest of honors. He assured Mrs. Thompson that she was still the best and favorite teacher he ever had in"	Society & Culture

what are surgery/treatment options for herniated C5 C6? .  . Treatment options are varied, starting with conservative treatment including anti-inflammatory medications, pain medications if needed and physical therapy.  In some cases, a neck brace may be used, but often is not due to the fact that long term brace use will cause loss of muscle tone in the neck.  Braces are most often used as comfort measures in the case of simple herniation of a single cervical disc.  If the herniation is causing loss of function and/or sensation  due to nerve root compression, surgery may be recommended.  It is very important to  have realistic expectations for surgery, which in most cases would be a simple laminectomy/discectomy where they remove the loose  disc matter and a small amount of bone.  This type of surgery is usually done through the front of the neck with the incision along a natural skin fold, leaving a very minimal scar.  In a number of cases, surgery is NOT effective for pain relief, but WILL often allow you to regain lost function with time and therapy as well as prevent additional loss of function.  Lost sensation may or may not return.  For simple herniations, surgery is rarely more involved than this.  If more extensive surgery is recommended, it would be wise to seek additional medical/surgical opinions.	Science & Mathematics

Speaking bluntly, he masturbates, he looks at other women, he picks his toenails, etc.  In short, he does all the normal ""guy"" stuff.\n\nI know it might be difficult to reconcile how he can be ""so in love"" with you and be involved in these ""distractions"" but it is very possible.  He might be curious, he might have decided that he wants a certain kind of relationship with you and he will get other devious needs fulfilled outside of your relationship.  It might also mean he secretly wants you to do some of that stuff, but he doesn't have the guts to ask.\n\nLong story short, if this bothers you, and it obvioulsy does to the point that you threatened to end the relationship over it, consider talking to him about this.  You don't have to tell him you caught him a second time, but you should ask him if he is really fulfilled - both emotionally and physically...or ask him on a scale of 1-10, or some other way that might get him to open up without feeling threatened - it won't be easy because this is a delicate subject.\n\nAnyway, good luck.\nC"	Family & Relationships

Refinance or buy new??  This is for you financial guru's!? . Ok here's the deal.  Almost a year and a half ago I bought a new car, thanks to a hefty down payment.  I had only been living in my home for 6 months or so, I hadn't started my now current job, and I had very poor credit.  \nSince then I have paid a few things off on my credit, but not all things by far, I have been at my job almost a year and a half, I've lived in my apt for just under 2 years. \nMy question is because of my circumstances previously I was slapped with an extremely high interest rate, just below the legal limit I believe.  Would it be worth it to refinance my car (2004 Vibe) or would it just be better to buy a newer car for around the same price or lower?  I would really like to have a lower interest rate & lower payment.  Also if it was chose to buy new, what are they chances I'd get slapped w/ such a high rate again?  Help!! . I would say refinance,(try seeing if your personal bank will take over the note)because it is alot easier, and the car market isn't as soft as it used to be (a soft market means low interest rates due to high production and people buying cars. We are currently in an economic rescession, so things have gotten tougher, or a 'hard market')so your probablility with getting an interest rate that is not much different or worse is higher that what I would want to risk. Also, speak to your personal banker. you may be able (if you have any) to pull some equity out of your car and use it to pay off more on your credit if that is high on your priority list. Good luck.

im i'm an aquarius who am i most compatible with? .  . * Symbol  : The Water Bearer  \n* House  : Eleventh House  \n* Ruling Planet  : Saturn / Uranus  \n* Gemstone  : Blue Sapphire  \n* Element  : Air  \n* Most compatible with  : Aquarius, Libra, Gemini  \n* Can be good with  : Aries, Sagittarius, Leo  \n* A 50-50 chance with  : Scorpio, Pisces, Cancer  \n* Doubtful with  : Taurus, Virgo, Capricorn \n \n \nYou seem to live on a different plane altogether - sympathetic, sensitive, friendly, but distant. It is very difficult for you to become very involved with anyone or anything. You are very conscious and value your personal space, this tends to bring about a certain loneliness, although you have a whole lot of friends who hold you in high regard. You tend to be philosophical and have strong intuitive powers. You are an admirer of beauty and everything about you seems soft and gentle. You are unconventional and like to be original, something that results in bizarre and unpredictable behaviour. You like to broaden your horizons of knowledge and are always ready to think beyond the present. Having an analytical mind, you are particularly drawn towards science. You are not easily agitated and are patient and persevering. Aquarians hold strong beliefs and it is not easy to change their minds or opinions. However, in matters of religion, they are not fanatics. They accept the idea of universal brotherhood and are mostly modern in their outlook.\n\n\nDiscover The lover in you:-\nYou will allow very few people to encroach on your personal space. The lucky ones who you allow intimacy,will however find you fascinating and quite enchanting. Those you fall in love with will most likely share your artistic and intellectual interests. Once in love, you will try to make everything perfect for your partner. You will accommodate, compromise and adapt even if you find that person is not exactly the ideal match you imagined him or her to be. Besides Aquarians, you are best suited to marry those born under Gemini and Libra. Your fondness for travel will find you settling down some place far from where you spent your childhood. You are a home-loving person, having a penchant for cooking and other domestic activities, collecting spices and trying out various recipes are often your pastime pleasures. Your approach to love and marriage is logical and intellectual, loving with your mind, as well as your eyes. You treat children with respect and give due consideration to their views.

To what extent can I use pictures of my kids that I didn't take? . I paid quite a bit of money to someone to take some photos of my children and with that package came all the proofs.  She would not sell me the photos on disk, and I did not purchase any more of the photos than the proofs.\n\nI scanned them into my computer and Photoshopped them and produced a large print for my wall, and some people really liked it...\n\nCan I go about selling this print if people wanted to buy it?  I didn't take the picture, but I paid for it to be taken and they are my kids... where is the line?  Can I legally do this? . You need to look into the terms of the contract that existed between you and the photographer.\n\nWhen a photographer takes a photo they own the copyright to it, just as happens when anybody creates any sort of work in tangible form be it writing, a movie, a painting or a photo.\n\nOften when someone commissions a person to produce a work on their behalf the person doing the commissioning does so on the understanding that they will have copyright of that work.\n\nThe fact that they're your kids doesn't have any bearing on the matter.  \n\nFirstly you should check through any smallprint and see what that says.  In the absence of any terms or conditions then approach the photographer and see what she has to say regarding ownership of copyright.  You caould always state that you hired her on the understanfing that you would be granted copyright.\n\nUntil things are resolved I woundn't go selling the prints.\n\nI hope you manage to get things sorted - good luck.

Check out your local gyms and find a water aerobics class you can drop into.  If you go once or twice, then you can probably start doing the exercises on your own.	Health

I take a couple of Tylenol each night to help me sleep.? . I normally take a couple tynenol at night before I go to bed. Are thier any health concerns with taking tylenol daily ? . You should discuss this with your doctor.  If he says it is ok for you to take each night, then the only risk you have is that of building up a drug tolerance.  As you build up a tolerance, you will have to increase your dosages in order to achieve the same effects.  My advice, try something else to help you sleep, such as chamomile tea.  If you really want meds, talk to your doctor about a prescription sleep aid.  This way, when you need to use Tylenol for a pain killer, you won't have a huge tolerance to it.	Health

Do Australians really have the ability to communicate with animals? .  . Yes, we do, and the funny thing is, it's not just us Aussies. You can do it too. \n\nNext time you ask your dog if it wants to go 'walkies' or tell the cat off for scatching the couch, that's communication. When the dog scratches at the door to go out, that's communication too.\n\nThe animal undertands by your tone and previous experience what you mean, not the words, so an in-depth discussion about the current world political situation is unlikely to raise much of a response, from either cat or dog.

Do any one have the list of Pay Per Click search engines that's ordered by search engines charging the lowest. \ne.g. adwords.google.com, overture.com . You have to be careful when looking for a deal. If a market seems underpriced it is usually because there is less value there. Overture / Yahoo! and Google AdWords are names you can trust. MSN AdCenter (in beta testing as of writing this) should be good too, but after them the distribution and quality likely fall off fast.\n\nThe top engines go back and forth on which provides the best ROI from vertical to vertical or even item to item or keyword to keyword based on a wide variety of factors.\n\nI need to update the following list to include MSN, but other than that it should have most of the tier 2 players listed (although for most people I just recommend focusing on Google Yahoo! and MSN).

Do you think anything bad will happen on 6/6/06? . Seriously. . it'll be an ordinary day.  not even Jesus can predict the end of the world.  let me explain 666 and I'll try not to make it boring. the beginning of Rev 13 describes a beast coming out of the sea and a dragon giving it its power Daniel 7:17 says a beast reps a King or Kingdom. Revelation 13 says a beast rose out of the sea. Rev 17:15 says that the sea in prophecy reps people. Daniel 7 says the dragon represents Roman Empire. According to Rev 13 the dragon gave the beast its power, this beast claims to be the son of God and to have power to forgive which is blasphemy. Jn 10:33 says blasphemy is men making himself equal to God. Rev 13 says the beast will have power to persecute and make war against God's people (saints) and nations for 42 months, Ezekiel and Daniel say that in prophetic terms 42 mos. equals 1260 years. In 538 Justinian gave the Papacy Governmental power to rule over every nation, in 1798 Napoleon captured the Pope and the Pope didn't have that power again. 538 to 1798 equals 1260 yrs! This and other info in the Bible tells us that the beast was the Papacy. The Pope's name in latin is Vicarivus Filii Dei. The Bible says that the number 666 represents the number of the beast. When you add up the Roman numerals of this name I = 1 V=5 C=100 D=500 this adds up to 666 which is the mark of the Beast. A few places in the Bible it says that the Beast or antichrist in knows who he is.\nAwhile ago the pope took that name off his hat.\nI have more to share about Rev 13 and many other fulfilled prophecies of Rev, if you'd like to know more plz contact me	Society & Culture
How do I get my ex back? I really want him back.? . We have a thirteen year old.  Things have always been very explosive.  We love each other or the other way.  I decided a couple of months ago that I love him and want him back.  He has a long distant girlfriend that comes around.  We have spent a couple of nites together....at my doing.  He acts like he is crazy about me until he thinks about it and he with draws.  I know he cares but I don't know if I should keep pursuing things or just let him work things out within himself.  There is alot of history between us.  Whenever I get involved with someone new he shows up on my doorstep.  I'm not sure what else to do.  If I push too much I think he will really run.  Should I keep going or give it a rest for now??? . Please move on for your own sake.  Find someone who will be with you through thick and thin.  Obviously, he still does not know what he wants.  And with a 13 year old, he should definitely man up and stop just coming around when he feels like it.  So DATE, you will feel better about yourself.  You deserve better than what he is giving you right now.  If he does change, and proves to you he has changed, and you want to be with him - then great, it was meant to be.  Until then, don't let him run your life.	Family & Relationships

If man evolved from monkeys and apes, why are there still monkeys and apes? .  . That's the point, men didn't evolve from monkeys and apes. Men, monkeys and apes all evolved from a common ancestor.\n\nThink about this way: If you took 100 people from Earth and placed them on an outbound spaceship to wherever. Then you took another 100 people from Earth and placed them on a another outbound spaceship to a different wherever. If you were to wait a few hundred thousand generations, do you think the descendents of those two colonies would still be members of the same species?\n\nIf you take in consideration all the different possible adaptations that would potentially be needed to survive in whatever locations the two colonies eventually relocated to would drive the two groups of people possibly diverge greatly from one another. With each successive adaptation would direct the potential needs for future adaptations to new future environments.\n\nHowever, this is exactly what happened to allow for the diveregence between monkeys, apes and humans. Whatever the common ancestor was between us, that population was divided -- be it geographically, as was the case in the hypothetical scenerio I supposed above, or otherwise -- and these two different populations collected different adaptations based on the restrictions put forth by their different environments. These differing adaptations continued to collect to the point that eventually different species were produced.	Science & Mathematics

"Is VB.NET programming more lucrative than Web design? .  . Well, VB.NET is a language...but with it you can do website development, application development, Windows Services, and more.  So, I'm a little confused by your question.  Here's a few ways I'm interpreting your question, and my answers to them:\n\nIf you mean ""design versus programming"", then it's a WHOLE DIFFERENT BEAST.  Because VB.NET is a language (just like Spanish or French), you have to learn to 'speak' it in order to use it well.  Sure, Microsoft automates some of it for you, but you don't really unleash the full potential of the language unless you edit it by hand.\n\nIf you mean ""application versus web development"", then they're pretty similar, under the hood.  VB.NET for web pages is the same VB.NET that you'd use for application development.  There's some significant differences between the two, but someone who codes VB.NET for web pages should have no problem coding VB.NET applications.\n\nIf you are talking about career paths, and which direction is more in demand, then that's a hard one.  Web design doesn't always pay very good...and it's REALLY competitive!  On the other hand, VB.NET isn't a really popular language in the market right now.  See, Visual Basic (the original language) all but ruined any chance VB.NET had of being taken seriously.  Instead of VB.NET, if it were me, I'd learn C# (...which really pains me to say because I'm a VB.NET guy...but hey, I'm being honest here...)\n\nHope at least ONE of those helps!  LOL\n--Dan"	Computers & Internet

"Who labled cuss words as a cuss words? . This is a serious question, so please try to give your honest opinion and/or knowledge of the subject.  Being immature is not my intent!\n\nBut really...who said one day, ""S*it!  Uh oh.  I think that is a bad word"", or who said, ""what is something bad I can say?  F*ck sounds good.  I think that'll be a bad word"".\n\nI know the bible says something along the lines for ""don't let foolish words come from you mouth"", but again, who said these words were foolish.  How come 'hippie' isn't an bad word, or who said that 'gun' isn't a bad word.  Why it it okay to say ""OW!"" when you hurt yourself.  But its not okay to say ""S*it!"" or ""Damn it!"".  \nI'd just like to know where in time were these rules and words made up.  Thanks in advance for your opinion. . The selection of words would have to do with proper speech and improper or slang. The ""cuss"" words refers to curse or the words used to wish some harm or bad thing to another person. The Bible makes the difference in the heart. We are to use our speech for others well being and encouragement. I can say that some foods make me sick and nothing is offensive about that. But if I say to another person ""you make me sick"" I have used my speech to hurt another and this is wrong."	Society & Culture
"Gulf Coast residents? . Are you planning to evacuate or ride out the next huricane or storm ?\n\n\n\nHouston area resident . Having been in the path of a direct hit by Hurricane Claudette on July 15, 2003, I have to say that I'm not so sure about hanging around for something like that again.  The house I live in made it through Hurricane Carla in 1961 packing winds (COMING ASHORE) of 165 mph.  I now figure if it's barely a hurricane of say 74-80 mph, a category one, I will probably stay.  That doesn't mean I won't be scared as hell, but something of that size going North or South of here isn't going to cause me to leave.  We were blindsided by Hurricane Claudette sneaking up the coast overnight and caught EVERYBODY ""with their pants down"" so to say.  That was probably the scariest thing I've ever been witness to in my 43 years on this planet.  The wind was screaming past my front door right at 100 mph.  Had I known that was on the way we would have got the hell out of here.  One tornado took out huge trees right next door, while I only had to replace about five shingles.  That tornado went right over the house while I was putting all 240 pounds of me on the front door trying to close it.  The whistling was like screaming banshees.  The wind was howling.  I mean literally howling.  It still scares me to think about it. For most of my life I wondered what it would be like to ride out a hurricane.  Now I know.  Will I leave or ride it out?  Chances are pretty good I'm outta here.  Many ""old-timers"" and idiots thought they could ride out another hurricane.  Many of those ""old-timers"" and idiots didn't make through to tell us all about it.  Don't be an idiot.  Listen to your common sense and watch the advisories.

The only thing you can do is to trust him,and communicate with him. If you talk to him about things, then maybe he will be honest with you and communicate his feelings as well. If you can't be open with him about things, he is more likely to stray if he doesn't feel you are giving him what you need. If you try all these things, then maybe you two can be happy together. The one thing you do not want to do is try to control him, this will drive him away completely. Be his girlfriend, be loving, and caring and pay attention to him and definately COMMUNICATE! that is the key. GOOD LUCK AND GOD BLESS!	Family & Relationships

how should i complete my given task if i am not able to solve it and my colleagues are also not helping me? .  . Great question... I have trouble with the same thing. (See my most recent question about screwing up on the job)  \n\nAside from the fact that people may be too busy, too incompetent, or just not compassionate enough to help, it may be that they jsut want to stay the hell out of the task/situation.  Some tasks are such hot button and sensitive issues that someone is afraid to step up and advice you for fear of inadvertantly being a fall guy for any failures.  In my job I am employed as a kind of problem solver and project manager and report only to the CEO and have no subordinates.  I get handed the crap that nobody else wants to deal with basically.  Since I have to coordinate with at least a few people for each task/project/issue.... people start to get pretty scared, knowing what the project is, or simply the fact that I'm calling.  It sucks. \n\nSo, my advice is this.... come up with a solution on your own using your best judgement, then hold a meeting with your boss to discuss it.  If your boss catches your mistakes, that should be ok... you might lose some credibility in the short run... but you can later show that you learned from the mistakes and maybe improved on the current process.  I would also avoid telling your boss that nobody will help you... sounds kind of childish.	Business & Finance

"stuck in  pit? . i couldnt try out for the basketball team becuz i didnt have my physical in time. i tried everything to get it in time but i could not. so i ended up failing to make the var team my senior yr. i worked hard for 4 years and everything jus came to  an end jus because i didnt turn a piece of paper in time. and the coaches were real ass holes. they though i sucked cuz they never seen me play. but i reality, i was probably better than at least two ppl who made it to the varsity. i use to play basketball all the time cuz i wanted to get better. but now it seems like i have no more purpose in it. the rainy season is starting where i live and i cant really find anyone to play with unless i join the team, which i cant. i dont feel a desire to play ball anymore. what should i do . First off, it's important to remember that certain rules are in place for a reason.  If you weren't able to have you physical on time, you need to take responsibility for your actions.  The same can be said for your actions/decisions during a basketball game.\n\nThe difference between you and the other two players you mentioned who ""aren't as good as you but made the varsity,"" is that they handed in all the requirements that they needed.  This opened the door for them to try out for the team and eventually get a roster spot.\n\nIn your case, I suggest that you take your physical.  See if you could try to make it into your varsity as a walk-on by attending practice and making yourself available as a practice player (should they have need of one).  If your work ethic is good and you come regularly, I'm pretty sure the coaches would notice.  And then, who knows.\n\nGood luck and I hope this was helpful."	Sports

explain why sounds travel faster in warm air than in cool air? .  . Actually, sound travels FASTER in cooler air.\n\nThe speed of sound in a medium (air, water, etc.) is faster when the medium is denser.  Water is denser than air, and sound travels faster in water than in air.\n\nCold air is denser than hot air, so the sound is transmitted faster.  Since the density difference is small, so is the speed difference.  Sound is faster in colder air, but not MUCH faster.	Science & Mathematics

First, I just wanted to clarify a previous answer which said that a felony is another word for federal, which is blatantly false. There are state felonies and federal felonies, and they are very different.\n\nNow, to answer your question, federal law does prohibit felons from owning firearms, as do most state laws, but there are ways to get relief from this and be able to regain the right to own a gun. If your conviction was federal, this can essentially only be done with a presidential pardon. If it was a state conviction, in Alabama, only felons convicted of committing or attempting to commit a ""crime of violence"" is prohibited from owning a pistol. Otherwise, state law does not seem to prohibit felons from owning guns."	Politics & Government

"So heres the problem......? . Ok Im almost 19, and have never had an Actual b/f. Ive sorta decided that the reasoning could be that about the time most girls start dating, a lot of things were goin on with my family, and I just was depressed all the time. And b/c my dad had just moved back in with us, I really just had other things to worry about! But now that Im older and feel like I could actually have a relationship, at the same time I am really scared!! I feel like most guys will expect things, and I never really got to see what it was like with a stupid Jr High b/f. So the point is, what should I do!! B/c Im scared that Im gonna be alone forever, if I dont freakin get some confidence and start actually believing it when guys like me!! Also, some guy really wants to meet me from online..and I just amd totally against online dating..at least for me.Am Im just being scared, or safe!? Im so confused!! Help me out with all this Please!! and please dont be rude . Don't date online. I have too many friends that have been roped into becoming emotionally invested in somebody they're ""dating"" online who turns out to be nothing like the person they presented themselves to be. Just stay away from it.\n\nAnd don't worry about inexperience. Most guys your age arn't all that experienced, either.\n\nJust make sure you know that none of the first 5 guys you date are going to be the guy you marry. The thing people learn in those young romances is that falling in love with the idea of being in love only leads you to heartbreak.\n\nI started dating by picking a guy I worked with who was a lot of fun to be around, who had a great sense of humor, went to my best friends' church, and had a reputation for getting around. I picked him because I was ready for a lover, but not for a relationship. That's exactly what we had, and nothing more, and I've never regretted it.\n\nDon't get a boyfriend. Get ""guys you're seeing"" and then get ""lovers"" and someday get a ""significant other"" and someday you'll have a husband. But the experiences you'll be having now are to get to know yourself, to get to know what kind of men are out there, to get to know how relationships work, what you have to put into them, and what you can expect to get out of them.\n\nObviously, your parents had problems. In my opinion, many married couples have problems because they didn't date enough first. Sometimes, they get curious as to what it would be like to be with someone else. Sometimes, they don't realize how much work needs to go into a relationship to keep it going. Sometimes they think they should be getting more out of the marriage.

"What is the acronym for Company Commander in the US Navy? .  . About the only time you see a Company Commander in the navy is in boot camp or at OCS. The Navy tends to be organized for efficient specialty groups to run ships and these groups are called Divisions.  OC Division is communications - with radiomen and signalmen. The fall under an ""O"" or Operations department head. So the heirarchy goes from the CO (captain) to the XO (executive officer) to the Deparment Head usually referred to by OPPS or DECK or GUNS for example ... to the Division Officer (equivalent perhaps of a company commander in other services.)  Now, what would  be the acronym for a Division Officer? Well - if you were a surface warfare officer - you might be called a SWO (but the captain and xo are also SWOs). It does seem that shore based operations for the Navy sometimes configure themselves with ""company"" designations. I guess in that case you'd just call them the ""Company Commander"".  Maybe we can give them an anacronym. Let's do it. Let's call them a ""CC""."	Politics & Government

""I pledge alliegence to the flag of the United States of America, and to the republic for which it stands, one nation with liberty and justice for all."" Then those that wish to may add 'In God We Trust' and it would be illegal to prevent anyone or to force from adding the last? . I'm as patriotic as the next guy, moreso if the next guy hasn't done 18 years in the military.  I am also an atheist, and I therefore am not all that happy with the pledge as it now stands.  \n\nThe pledge lacked the words ""under God"" until 1954.  During the height of the Red Scare, Congress stuck those two words into the thing to differentiate us from those ""godless commies"".  (It seems to me that taking the pledge out of the elementary schools would have done a better job.  The idea that little children should have to stand up and recite a loyalty oath every day seems, well, communist. It evokes images of Chinese children saluting pictures of Chairman Mao.)  Slapping ""under God"" in there basically made the Pledge of Allegiance a pain in the rear in that I have to pray to/acknowledge a deity in order to recite the thing.  When it comes up (which is rarely as an adult) I just leave those two words out.\n\nWhat's funny is that the pledge existed for 62 years just fine before some religious folks conflated patriotism and belief in Judeo-Christian mythology.  Now if anyone tries to restore the pledge to its original form, they are accused of interfering with tradition."	Society & Culture

"Christ the Firstborn in Colossians 1:15 doesnt mean first created in the greek? . Often while talking to a Jehovah's Witness the subject of the deity of Jesus Christ will be discussed. One of the most effective ways of sharing the Gospel with a Jehovah's Witness is by using photocopies of their own books and magazines. By doing so the Jehovah's Witness is more likely to hear what is being said. It can also effectively demonstrate that the Watchtower Bible and Tract society is a false prophet organization. Until this confidence in the cult's authority is undermined the deceived cultist will usually be unable to truly hear what is being said about God and the Bible.

"why is it that a spinal cord can not heal at all after  an accident? .  . The spinal cord can heal to some extent in some cases, but it depends on the severity.  For instance, Christopher Reeve had a severe spinal cord injury, termed ""complete"" or ASIA Class A with very little chance of meaningful recovery.  However, in some less severe cases there is a chance of significant recovery.  There are cases of people initially paralyzed completely from the neck down who, after recovery, can walk.  However, in virtually all these cases, these patients had, at the time of initial preservation, at the very least some sensation below the level of injury indicating an ""incomplete"" lesion.

Can the rep ask to have private meetings with the kids, go through the house (cupboards and closets). There is no abuse occuring. . You have a right to not let CPS in your home especially if they have been there before, the only way they can just show up and get in is if they have a police officer who has a search warrant, or either they have a search warrant.\n\nCPS has a habit of wanting to show up at any given time, and demand to be let in, this is only done so they can come and gather up evidence against you. Any litlle thing they can find will come back against you. They are the masters of twisting the truth, and using whatever you say and do against you, so be careful of what you do and say.\n\nYou have a right to privacy, and if these people have a habit of just popping up, put out ""no trespassing"" signs, when they just pop up, especially if they have already spoke with you, they can be reported for trespassing, this is kinda tricky though, because it has to be a situation where the case they are trying to build evidnce on is about to be or already is closed or unsubstanitiated ( they like to use this word)\n\nMake sure your house is clean, you have food in the fridge, and basically your p's and q's are together. You don't want them holding anything against you! You also have a right to an attorney, and it may be in your best interest to get one,  CPS acts fast, and things turn sour with them real quick.

Google fightcps.com, that website is very helpful. Just when you think you are in this alone, trust me, you are not. I wish you and your family the best!\n\nOh, I almost forgot to add, CPS will interview your daughter by herself, although a child's word doesn't count in court until they are 14, I think, but they will do this, I'm not sure if this is legal or that they are supposed to, but they do and probably will in your case.\n\nMake sure you have people who can vouch that you are not abusing your child!

last year Cleaver Energy had negative cash flow, but the cash on the balance sheet increased, why? . a)the company paid a large dividend\nb)the company had high amoritization expenses\nc)the company repurcheased 20% of its common stock\nd)the company sold a new issue of bonds\nd) the company made a large investment in new plant and equipment . Without looking at the financial statements this is a bit tricky, however I think that the answer is D (the first one) they issues bonds.  \n\nThe bonds exchange debt for cash.  The had large cash outflows, due to the dividend, equipment purchase and the repurchase of common stock, it would result in a cash deficit.  The amortization expense does not effect cash flow. If the cash balance went up, it is because the bond issue generated more cash than the cumulative deficit created by the operations (profits and losses adjusted for cash) or because they may have large payables due to the capital purchases (doubtful but possible)  It looks to me, from your description, that the company has determined that long term debt (bonds) is cheaper than equity, so it reduced equity through stock repurchase and dividends and replaced that cash, through a bond issue.

Are P1 & P2 moons just found in orbit around Pluto New ? or Just discovered ? or From Meteor crash? . I just want to know if the moons are new or just newly discovered, or could they be from debris after the meteor crashed into Pluto last year ??? . P1 & P2 are pre-existing moons, not the results of recent impacts.  There are a number of indicators as to this.\n\nThe first, to rule out a meteor impact in the past year, is that after the moons were noticed in 2005, photographs taken by Hubble from June 2002 - May 2003 showed the moons.\n\nAnother indicator that they have been there for a long time is their orbital stability.  They are in circular orbits in the same plane and direction as Charon, the previously known moon of Pluto.\n\nThere have also been no disturbances in Charon's orbit which would likely be the case if two new bodies were introduced into the Pluto system.  If they were recently introduced into Pluto's orbit, they would show a more erratic orbit, most likely not in the same plane as Charon and in a more eccentric orbit, moving closer and further from Pluto throughout their orbits.

"solve  3x - 8 + x + 4? .  . You cannot ""solve"" this because it is not an equation.  An equation has two parts that are joined by the symbol =.  However, in early pre-Algebra classes, they might ask you to simplify this, meaning, to write this expression so that the ""x"" only appears once with its coefficient and the rest of the numerical values are also combined.  For this, you add all of the coefficients of x (3+1 - invisible coefficient before the second appearance of x) to find that you have 4x.  Next, you add the -8 and 4, which you can then express as either adding negative four or as subtracting four (if you need help here, consider the number line, move eight spaces to the left of zero, then move four spaces to the right).  Thus, you can re-write the expression as 4x-4.  Look in your textbook before the problems for a better example of what exactly they are expecting you to do in that section."	Education & Reference

is it possible that God is a little less omniscient than we assume ?? . we humans are too small to understand if there is a God or not.\nfor arguments sake, let's assume a God exists and created us.\n\nTo me, it would make sense if God was a little less omniscient than we all assume.He created us,believing that humans exist to LOVE.Like a scientist who invents something nuclear,yet never imagines that people also can do bad things with it.\n\nGod created us thinking we would be creatures with Pure Love. He probably never imagined we would do bad things with our freewill.Humans of Pure Love wouldn't care about stealing, because they would be happy that the thief gained something. \n\nif this was true, then i would have much more understanding for a God created us.At least i think this makes more sense then the satan-crap which is invented by people who need an explanation for 'badness'.\n\nCould it be possible that God created us thinking that we would be creatures with only feelings of Love,but that He just made an error in judgement,like almost all inventors do ?? . I spent five years of my life trying to understand this andother parts of ideas like this.  And for all that searching, you come to realize that these is no absolute answers on a question like this.  However, you said you assume a God, one that created us.  From here on out is my thought process, no extra websites to look up, no extra references to any books.  \n\nWhy does one create,  and in God's case why did He create us?  Could it have been that it was a selfish act?  I don't believe it would be, since if it had been a selfish act why would we be given free will?  Free will gives us the right to do as we wish, if God had been looking for something solely for Him, He would have definately skipped the whole free will thing.  \n\nCould it have been that we were created for, and out of, love?  Our being so small, we couldn't hope to understand what God's condition was before the time of our creation, but we can assume that if He hadn't created anything yet that there was nothing there.  I don't know about you, but I would be darn lonely out there in a void of nothingness with not even a single thing to talk to.  In his wisdom, I am sure he wanted to have comapny, but company that would be itself and not something that would be a puppet.  He needed something that could experience things for itself, think for itself, love on its own terms and not on His.  I would be certain He could see that in creating something like this, there might have been the chance that it wouldn't choose to love Him.  The next obvious thought is make a lot of it, and I dare say He did, look at how many of us there are!  \n\nAnyway,  cutting a whole lot of details out,  God made us out of love so that we may love Him back.  Thats all He truely wants I believe, not that you go out and do these things this way and think that those guys over there are bad because they don't do it this way.  I think that He just wants our love, but He is a good enough person to give us the choice; to love Him or not.  If we have the choice of love or not,  then He couldn't be omniscient it would ruin the whole effect.  Even if he is omniscient, He could only see all our possible outcomes, not what we are going to choose, He'll have to wait with baited breath just like the rest of us.  \n\nI firmly believe that He is a lot more like a person you and I would be like than we give Him credit for.  He has feelings, He gets angry, sad, worried, feels love and pain as well.  Not in the same ways of course, He is a universial being and we're only little flesh and blood thingies right now.  But I say that He is waiting to see what all of us are going to decide about Him.  I say He's been one of the nicest people I've ever met, and I only met Him through a couple of books, a few other people, and just thinking about Him.  My mind bursts at the thought of a personal meeting one day.  \n\nAll in all, I think its up to you.  It sounds like you already have an answer.  I hope that maybe one day we can all know that God is a being of Love, and not debate the silly specifics about it. But I guess we'll see.  ^^\n\n(summary and disclaimers :P )\nGod is not omniscient.\nGod is a being of love.\nHe is waiting for us to decide if we like Him or not.\nI used He and Him just to keep it all simple and clean, I think that God is beyond gender or any qualifier that we have.  \nI also don't mean to attack any religion what-so-ever, because I think you are entitled to your beliefes, and I thank you for it because without it think how boreing all of us would be.  (gives me the chills thinking about a world where we're all the same.)\n\nSorry to ramble, and thanks for your time.  ^^	Society & Culture
"How to write a letter requesting an interview? . Do anyone know a format that i can use to write a letter requesting an interview? Or a site that can help me out? . One of the more common forms of the job search involves applying for jobs from either the newspaper, Internet job boards (such as monster.com) or internal resources.  It is good business etiquette to include a cover letter when applying for the position.\n\nWhat to include in the cover letter:\n\n1.  Your name and contact information at the top of the cover letter. It is ideal to use the same heading as the resume for purposes of consistency.\n\n2.  Today's date and the name of the contact person at the company and their job title, if this information is available.\n\n3.  The name of the company and company address\n\nThe greeting should be Dear Mr./Ms. XXXXXXX.  If you do not know the name of the contact person, then the the cover letter should be addressed to the Title, such as Dear  Human Resources Manager or Dear Hiring Manager.  In worse case scenario, it is safe to introduce the cover letter to the Human Resources Manager, even if you are unsure of the title.  You can use ""To Whom it May Concern,"" but it is ideal to address the cover letter in a more formal manner. \n\nThe first paragraph should be an introduction and should include your intention to apply for the job, the job title, internal job ID or job number if specified, and the company name. You should also include the date of posting and the name of the resource where the job is posted (Newspaper name, job board) with the name of the resource written in italics.\n\nThe body of the cover letter can include a number of items, but ideally you want to provide an over description of your career, experience and ability to perform the tasks involved in the job position. Try to address requirements that are listed in the job position and directly respond to these requirements within the cover letter.  The cover letter should also mention your enclosure or attachment (if emailed) of the resume and should either invite the reader to contact you or state your intentions to contact the employer.  The salutation should simply read -- Sincerely, followed by your name with 4 spaces in between.  Your written signature should go between the salutation and your name if you are submitting a printed copy."	Business & Finance

What do you think of California's initiative process?  Is it working? .  . No.\n\nIt wastes a lot of money, as every special interest group with any stake in any issue has to get out there and campaign.\n\nI don't think it does anything for the voters. It doesn't strengthen democracy. For Pete's sake: you elected folks to represent you in state government. If you don't like their representation, vote them out the next chance you get! And in the meantime, they should be making the decisions that you voted them into office to make, instead of punting to these initiatives all the time.\n\nAlso, I think that most people don't know enough about these issues to make sensible decisions. Elected representatives have staffs that research issues for them. They meet with experts. They collect testimony. Do you have time and resources to do all that for every issue that comes up? I know I don't. But putting these decisions directly into the hands of the voters means that people vote their emotions and opinions--their fears, usually--instead of the facts.\n\nIt's crazy.

Extraction plants created in Canada, Poland, Russia, and other nations produced the remaining helium. In the early 2000s, Algeria and Qatar were added as well. Algeria quickly became the second leading producer of helium. Through this time, both helium consumption and the costs of producing helium increased.'	Science & Mathematics

What vitamins and minerals should I be taking to insure a high level of testosterone? . I already take a multi-vitamin, and a few others, but i cant seem to find any info on neccesary materials for healthy testosterone production. . First and foremost why do you want to increase your testosterone levels? is it to become more muscular? or are you clinically deficient?\n\nI am just completing a phd on the effect of diet and exercise on testosterone levels so am well versed in this area. Testosterone is primarily synythesised in the leydig cells of the testes and as men age the production slows. it is not soley responsible for balding in men. What causes the balding is the increased converison of testosterone to DHT which targets the hair follicles. \n\nOne possible way of incresing testosterone is by doing some weight training. I am guessing you probably already do this as part of your regime. If not a moderate to high intensity weights programme has been shown to increase testosterone levels post exercise. Dietary methods of increasing your testosterone still needs research done. However there is limited research linking a high fat low fibre diet to increased testosterone production. This however is not reccomended as the health risks associated with a high fat diet such as CHD far outweigh any beneficial effects of increased testosterone production.\nWeeman	Health
Can anyone knows the effects of moon on humans/animals???? .  . When there is a full moon, the gravity is stronger (have you ever heard about the full moon affecting the tides?) Tides usually go very high around the full moon.\n\nThe extra pull on gravity makes primates feel slightly uncomfortable (humans and animals) and that causes them to get more agitated and a little more aggressive.  There are usually more fights around the full moon, and people tend to be a little more disagreeable.\n\n\nSame thing on cloudy days.  The air pressure is up and people get a little more irritable.  Know that, and you'll go far.  As people for behaviors on sunny days when it is not a full moon.	Science & Mathematics

who  will win this yrs formula one? . will it be michale shumacher or alonso, We all know once kimi joins ferrari next yr he will be unstopable . As of now the numbers indicate Alonso. But the last 2 races have changed the trend a bit in favor of Michael. However, if Michael wins all the time, and Alonso arrives second behind him all the time, it will take a VERY long time for Michael to pass him in the championship standings. Both cars seem now very reliable and fairly equal, so between tire choices and reliability, the fist team that screws up gives an edge to the other one. Alonso comes from a winning championship. He is young, aggressive, a good driver, and arrogant. Michael has unmatched experience, he is fast, tricky, and smarter. Now, if they had the same car, it would be a nice comparison!!! At the end, I think Michael can pull it off because his team is superior, and it would be nice to have him win an unheard of 8th title, and then retire in grand style. And yes, leave room to Kimi, who is unquestionably the fastest driver in the pack.	Sports

Give yourself time.  Part of the tearfullness may be frustration that you aren't recovering at as fast of a speed as you would like (which is often the case when a person is recovering at lightening fast speed).  \n\nYour brain is going through a lot, trying to program new areas to take over for the areas that wer damaged by the stroke.  Your body is doing a tremendious amount of work.  Tears are a natural way for the body to release and relax.  It really is ok to be teary.  I haven't seen any studies, but I would expect that you may be teary for *at least* a year after the stroke.\n\nHowever, I think the parents of teenage daughters will tell you they suffer from the tearfullness just because of the teenagers, so it might last until they are adults.  :)	Health

"how does a touch light work, is the person touching the light acting as the ground? .  . Touch-sensitive lamps almost always use a  property of the human body -- its capacitance. The word ""capacitance"" has as its root the word ""capacity"" -- capacitance is the capacity an object has to hold electrons. The lamp, when standing by itself on a table, has a certain capacitance. This means that if a circuit tried to charge the lamp with electrons, it would take a certain number to ""fill it."" When you touch the lamp, your body adds to its capacity. It takes more electrons to fill you and the lamp, and the circuit detects that difference. It is even possible to buy little plug-in boxes that can turn any lamp into a touch-sensitive lamp. They work on the same principle."	Science & Mathematics

Why is poop brown? . please tell me . As it turns out, not all poop is brown.  Sometimes poop can be green, yellow or nearly black.  On occasion there are pieces of red pepper, tomato skins, corn, peas, etc in it too.  But, by far, most poop is a shade of brown.\n\nThe color comes mainly from bilirubin, a pigment that arises from the breakdown of red blood cells in the liver and bone marrow. The actual metabolic pathway of bilirubin and its byproducts in the body is very complicated, so we will simply say that a lot of it ends up in the intestine, where it is further modified by bacterial action. But the color itself comes from iron. Iron in hemoglobin in red blood cells gives blood its red color, and iron in the waste product bilirubin gives rise to its brown color.	Business & Finance

"I know we all hate Bush for invading Irag but? . Exactly what did Kerry mean when he said:\n\n""Without question, we need to disarm Saddam Hussein. He is a brutal, murderous dictator, leading an oppressive regime ... He presents a particularly grievous threat because he is so consistently prone to miscalculation ... And now he is miscalculating America's response to his continued deceit and his consistent grasp for weapons of mass destruction ... So the threat of Saddam Hussein with weapons of mass destruction is real...""\n-- Sen. John F. Kerry (D, MA), Jan. 23. 2003 . He meant 'I think this is what the public believes and therefore it is what I'll say I believe to help me get elected.'  Besides, if he changed his mind later, he could always try to appease both sides by saying 'Well, I supported the war before I opposed it.'  What a deal, huh?\n\nLeaders are people who can make a decision and then follow through with the action to make things happen rather than asking what others think and then telling them they agree."

"correct me if I'm wrong but growing up as a kid I remember toothpaste was squeezed for a tube made of lead!? . I'm 50 years old now, and growing up untill the age of about 10 to 15 years old the old tootpaste tubes seemed to be made of lead. I have never seen one word published on this fact. . Yes.  There was some lead content in the tube until they discovered a few things.  For one thing, the lead pulled the fluoride OUT of the toothpaste so that all the benefits shown in the laboratory were missing after the toothpaste had been in the tube for a couple of months.  Most of the lead was thereby tied up in the tube and not released into the toothpaste, so the contributions of toothpaste tubes to lead poisoning is questionable, but the possibility that it was doing harm was another reason to discontinue the use of lead in toothpaste tubes.  Also, do a search on ""lead poisoning toothpaste"" and you will find thousands of references.  Leaded gas and house paints are far and away the greatest historical threat to the general public concerning lead poisoning."	Health

What is the strain of the wire? . A pole is connected to two wires in it's both ends and the wires are connected to the ceiling. The two wires are with the same length (the pole is parallel to the ceiling). The pole mass is M. One of the wires is cut (by scissors) so one side of the pole is starting to fall. What is the strain of the remaining wire at the moment right after the cutting? The optional solutions are Mg/2, Mg/4, Mg/3, 0, Mg. . Strain is defined as the fractional change in length under an applied force.  Since at the instant the other wire is cut (i.e., at t=0), the remaining wire remains stationary (until it starts to stretch at a later time), the strain on that wire is 0 becuase it hasn't changed length yet at t=0..\n\nThe answer is 0.

"What is the difference between optician and an optic specialist? .  . If you consider an optic specialist the equivalent of an opthamologist, the difference can be found if you look through Wikipedia, which I quote below:\n\n""An optician is an eye care professional who provides lenses for the correction of vision defects. The lenses may be contact lenses, or held in a frame in front of the eye, rarely as a monocle or most frequently as a pair of glasses, also known as spectacles or eyeglasses. The main optical properties of the lenses are specified from a refraction prescription supplied by a person qualified to measure visual defects and write an appropriate corrective prescription.\n\nvs.\n\nOphthalmology is the branch of medicine which deals with the diseases of the eye and their treatment. The word ophthalmology comes from the Greek roots ophthalmos meaning eye and logos meaning word; ophthalmology literally means ""the science of eyes."" As a discipline it applies to animal eyes also, since the differences from human practice are surprisingly minor and are related mainly to differences in anatomy or prevalence, not differences in disease processes. By convention the term ophthalmologist is more restricted and implies a medically trained specialist. Since ophthalmologists perform operations on eyes, they are generally categorized as surgeons."""

Far away I heard a faint humming sound getting louder and louder, and I noticed a small swirling, glowing mist coming twords me till it was circuling around my head, humming and swirling; In the mist I saw dozens of tiny silvery dots of glowing lights and suddenly they were flying through me and as each one went through me I was calling out their names: Blacky, Snowball, Bobbie, Spankie, Lilly, JJ, Misty etc. These dots of silver white were no bigger then a pea yet I knew instinctivly what they were, they were all the pets I ever had through out my entire life. I was filled with such love at that moment, as they became a part of me, it was as if we were one big happy family again. As I was standing there with my arms out streatched, laughing and crying with joy, I heard my name being called. Looking around, I noticed the people I saw eailer coming closer, as they got closer and closer, I began to recognize them.It was my Dad and my Grandma, and Grandpa, my Uncle John, my Aunt Margie and so on and so on, all of my loved ones who have passed on.

IM I over reacting if I ask my b-f to stop smoking marijuana....? . hes only 20 but he had never used drugs before,, 3 months throug my preagnancy he decided he wanted to start smoking.. I think even thoug hes young its not a good decition, since he should be getting ready to rase a child in the best conditions posible.. I am DRUG free and demand the same from him.. Maybe if a baby was not envolve or if he would of have this havitt when we met I wouldnt make such a big deal. I just want a stable DAD for my son. . I do not think that you are overreacting. Please do not allow him to smoke marijuana around you or your baby. This is a decision that your boyfriend has to make on his own. He knows your stand on this issue. The ball is in your court. You need to decide if you want to have this man in you and your child's life. Pray about it. I wish you well.	Family & Relationships

"How to make a complaint for a cb radio going over all of your appliances? .  . First, whatever you do, don't call from your house.  Go somewhere outside of your neighborhood.  I have had similar problems in the past & I started calling everybody & anybody who would listen & what this did was really tick off the people who had the transmitters, as they were running a drug lab & using monitoring equipment to listen to the whole neighborhood in case of a bust or a complaint to the authorities.  Your best bet is to keep it simple.  The only company I would call from your house would be the Cable Company who services your area.  If you do not have Cable service, then go into the local office to make a report.  They will do the rest by sending out someone to check for ""Bleeding signal"" that could affect the airplanes flying in your area.  Whatever you do, don't go looking for the antenna...you could be endangering yourself & your family.  These people have LOTS of money & experience & can & will make your life a living he*l.  You may also want to go into your local Police Department & speak to someone so that they can be aware of the problem in the area with a bleeding signal.  Good Luck!  The FCC did not respond to my many calls, so unless you have an office in your area, you may have the same trouble I did with this agency."	Politics & Government
"What makes old men bitter? . I know women can be bitter, too, but it seems like there are more older men this way, or they're more noticable anyway. Any idea why? . merlin\n\nWhen they think - and thus feel - they have become worthless!\nThis is proberbal for both men and women; when you become more experianced of life you slowly, or suddenly, realise that whatever distractions you use to avoid this question, you are going to ask yourself, has my life been any use. Have I made any difference to anybody that I am alive?\n\nWhatever has happend in the past cannot be changed. Remorse, regret, guilt and a lot of unfinished stuff can bring a person down. Also the fear and anxiety about the future, when you feel your physical and mental capabilities diminishing - especially if you think it is improper to talk about it and no one could help you anyway - can make you really bitter.\n\nThe way out - go out of your way and do a good deed! Go help somebody by volunteering. Best is to use your experiances by helping a younger person, i.e., read to a child. \n\nHowever, the very best thing you can do as an ""old"" man is to go and admire a ""young"" man. I'm very serious. You go out of your way and acknowledge a young fellow for anything that he does which benefits a person or society in any way, then you'll feel very worthy of yourself and your life's experiances. \n\nTherefore AVOID CRITICIZING & GIVING ADVISE under all circumstances! Just admire - even if it is for brute strength only. ""Wow! You ARE strong (skillful, nimble, etc.). It takes a lot of strength (skill, agility, etc.) to be able to do that.""\n\nThis way, you are encouraging young men and women to be more self confident in themselves and in doing something beneficial. You'll feel their appreciation and your feeling of own self worthiness will grow - and so will your ""joie de vivre"" - your joy for life."	Society & Culture

""i love fruit salad"" is one example.  yes, fruit salad may be good, but  would you do anything for it?  die?  ""greater love does not exist than this: one lays down his life for his friend.""  we need to examine what we are calling ""love"".  1 corinthians 13 gives a complete definition of true love.  this list also can be used to define God and His characteristics.  therefore, yes i do agree, love is God, God is love.  for without God, can anyone truly love?"

PC PROBLEM? . Its a Motherboard problem,Model is GE PRO-HTProblem\nI have aperfectly normal working pc,i wanted to add\nmore memory to it,and stupudily i added sd ram to the\nddr ram thatn was already in there.So when starting up\nthe pc,the pc only recognised the sd ram,and not the\nddr ram,i took out the sd ram and put the ddr ram back\nin,did not work,put back the sd ram it works.Went on\nthe net to get help,someone gave me these steps.Take\nout sd ram after switching off the pc.Switch the pc\non,and then back off,then put in the ddr ram,switch\nback on,does not work,switch off put back sd ram,oh my\ngod now that does not work.So now my pc makes 3 beeps\nat a time.What can i do to make the pc work again? I\nhave took out the battery,and jumpers some told me to\ndo,but all i am getting is beeps.I have also reset thecmos. . This is interesting.  SDRAM and DDR RAM should not use the same slots.  The notches should have been slightly different.  Unless you forced the SDRAM into place.  RAMs were created so this type of mistake could not be done.  Check your notches on the RAMs and the notch in the DIMM controller.  Make sure you didn't damage any of them.\n\nTake both RAM's to a computer shop and have them verify the RAM is still working.  There is a possibility you damaged the RAM sticks.  I will take it that you did seat the RAM firmly in place, and in the correct way.  You may need to have the Motherboard checked also.\n\nWhen you did all the switching, taking out the battery and jumpers, did you unplug the PC from the wall?  If you didn't, you may have done damage to the Motherboard.  Even though the computer may not be running, with the power cord still plugged to the wall socket, the CMOS and other internal systems still use the current coming from the Power Supply.  The CMOS battery (the small round battery you took out) uses the Power Supply so it will not die quickly, and, the CMOS will not clear if the Power Supply still has power.\n\nOnce you find out if the RAM is still good, try the DDR RAM again.  Don't use the SDRAM.	Computers & Internet

Ladies Part II  (Feedback was good, would like more opinions.  I added more detail too)? . I been dating my girl for over a year and a half, and it would be an understatement to say it has been easy. We have had to deal with a lot of difficult situations to make it work, but we have made it. I consider myself a good guy, lets just say momma raised me right. Open doors, make sure she gets what she wants, I even make sure its ok with her before I go out (not too many guys do that) but like i said we have been through a lot and i truly love this girl. Sometimes I feel like I dont get that in return, I have spoiled this girl, and I feel bad when I say no to her on something, which rarely happens. Should I expect to be treated the same way? I dont want to break up with her, I just want to feel like I am a priority in her life, we are talking about moving in together. I have talked to her, its the little things that matter, I just dont know how to either help her change, or deal with it, any suggestions?? . Sounds like you are over-compromising and not being yourself. If you always do what she wants, how can she do what you want and why would she?! A relationship should be give and take but if someone can get away with making no effort etc, then they are going to. Start suggesting what you want to do, don;t always agree with everything she says. It might also make you a bit more exciting to her again. That is not about being raised right - you can still be polite etc but just about being yourself not a doormat.	Family & Relationships

Is it true? . I want to leave my Arab country to life in any country like USA or Australia or Europe, but no one advice me to do and they say all the worlds hate Arabic people! Especially Islam is it true? . I know that in large cities, there are plenty of Arabs and Muslims and people are used to seeing them and probably have come to realize that they are not dangerous or to be hated just for being Arab or Muslim.  \n\nBut I must tell you the truth.  There are people who hate Arabs and Muslims.  But our laws in USA are made to protect people from hate crimes and persecution.  So I hope you would be safe here, and in fact, I feel confident that you would be safe so long as you respect the laws of our country.\n\nI live in a small town, and even here, I am not aware of any problem with being Muslim or Arab here.  My doctor is a Muslim, and I THINK he's Arab, although I'm not sure.  But he is open about being Muslim, and he even has a Qur'an in his office.  He is respected here as a doctor and I've never heard anyone express hatred of him for his religion.\n\nWhere I go to college is still fairly small, but a little bigger than my hometown, and I daily see Muslim women in hijab, etc.  I have never seen anyone mistreat them at all, and they are respected.\n\nI regularly go to a store that sells Middle Eastern foods and it is owned by a Muslim family from Syria, and they serve lots of the Muslim students.  Again, I've never heard of any problems.  He is the nicest guy you'd ever want to meet, and he is respected by the people in the town.\n\nI cannot speak for Europe or Australia, but I have heard of lots of anti-Muslim things happening in France.  If I were a Muslim I do not think I would want to go to France.\n\nI hope that this answers your question.  In my book, you are sure welcome in our country.	Society & Culture
"what is water gate scandle in US? .  . Mark Felt Was Deep Throat\n May 31, 2005 - The former deputy director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, W. Mark Felt, has been identified as Deep Throat by Vanity Fair magazine.\nW. Mark Felt, 91, was second-in-command at the FBI in the early 1970s. His identity was revealed by Vanity Fair magazine, scooping the Washington Post.\n\nThe revelation was confirmed by Bob Woodward on the Washington Post's website at 5.29pm Eastern time. MORE \n \n \n\nWatergate: The Scandal That Brought Down Richard Nixon\n ""Watergate"" is a general term used to describe a complex web of political scandals between 1972 and 1974. The word specifically refers to the Watergate Hotel in Washington D.C. \n\nThe Burglary\n\nWatergate has entered the political lexicon as a term synonymous with corruption and scandal, yet the Watergate Hotel is one of Washington's plushest hotels. Even today, it is home to former Senator Bob Dole and was once the place where Monica Lewinsky laid low. It was here that the Watergate Burglars broke into the Democratic Party's National Committee offices on June 17, 1972. If it had not been for the alert actions of Frank Wills, a security guard, the scandal may never have erupted. MORE\n\nChronology of Events\n\nThe story of Watergate has an intriguing historical and political background, arising out of political events of the 1960s such as Vietnam, and the publication of the Pentagon Papers in 1970. But the chronology of the scandal really begins during 1972, when the burglars were arrested. By 1973, Nixon had been re-elected, but the storm clouds were building. By early 1974, the nation was consumed by Watergate. MORE\n\nRichard Milhous Nixon\n\nRichard Milhous Nixon is one of the most fascinating political figures of the 20th Century. His long political career began in 1947 when he was elected to the House of Representatives. By 1952, Nixon had been chosen as Dwight Eisenhower's vice-presidential running mate, but not before he was embroiled in a scandal that led to the infamous Checkers Speech. \nNixon served as Vice-President for eight years, then lost the 1960 election to John F. Kennedy. He recovered from political defeat to be chosen again as the Republican Party's candidate at the 1968 election. Following a year of turmoil, including two political assassinations, Nixon became the nation's 37th President on January 20, 1969. Later that year, he delivered his 'Silent Majority' speech on the Vietnam War, articulating his belief that the bulk of the American people supported his policies and programs. He was vindicated by winning a landslide re-election. He was sworn in for a second term in Janury 1973. MORE\n\n\nNixon Reacts To Watergate\n\nNixon made three major speeches on the Watergate scandal during 1973 and 1974. The first was on April 30, 1973, in which he announced the departure of Dean, Haldeman and Ehrlichman. A more defiant speech was delivered on August 15, 1973. Perhaps the politically most difficult speech was the one on April 29, 1974, in which Nixon released partial transcripts of the White House tapes. MORE\n\nThe Investigations\n\nInitial investigations of Watergate were heavily influenced by the media, particularly the work of two reporters from the Washington Post, Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein, along with their mysterious informant, Deep Throat.\nPolitical investigations began in February 1973 when the Senate established a Committee to investigate the Watergate scandal. The public hearings of the Committee were sensational, including the evidence of John Dean, Nixon's former White House Counsel. The Committee also uncovered the existence of the secret White House tape recordings, sparking a major political and legal battle between the Congress and the President. \n\nIn 1974, the House of Representatives authorised the Judiciary Committee to consider impeachment proceedings against Nixon.

Question on the devil and belief in God? . So my understanding of the situation is that, it is the devil's job to try to get people to become unbelievers. My question is, does it bother the devil if people don't believe in him?

Frankly I'm agnostic and those answers don't help me in the least. I'm just asking this question because I'd like to know what believers think on this subject.\nThanks. . I don't think it bothers Satan at all if people do not believe in him.\n\nIf you don't believe in Satan, then you don't believe in what is taught in the Bible, and therefore are not a Christian.  Therefore, you'll go to Hell.\n\nThere's a saying that goes something like:\nSatan's greatest achievment was to make man believe he doesn't exist.	Society & Culture
Help! Tension Headaches?  The kind that starts at the base of the head/neck and goes to the front? . What works for you?  I have found that excedrine tension works for me, but it has caffeine in it and caffeine and me do not do well together- any other remedies for this specific headache type?  My mother bought me a pillow that you can put in the fridge or microwave- which is better for tension headahces? Head or cold? Thank you so much in advance! . I wouldn't put cold on back of neck, cold compresses are to constract. I suggest to buy a bag that is either sand or rice you put in microwave for no longer then 1- 2 min. place on back of neck(making sure not touch skin)This will open the blood flow back to brain. Also, a hot shower on back of neck. A good massage either by yourself or someone else. Always massage sides and middle moving (upward) still to allow more blood flow back to brain. Yes, caffien, smoking will not do. Never fall asleep using the bag, it could cause burns. Find out the reason for tension, try to elimate as much as posible of stress. Sleep well, eat right,and if you take pills, try off the counter first. I wouldn't suggest pain pills as they can be additive, and with more side affects. When massaging also massage your temples, where sinuses are and up beside nose. Massage forehead and whole head as well. Cold can also be helpfull with a wet cold cloth over eyes, or forehead. Always check with Doctor to find out exactly what he may think is causing problem. He might have catscan to see if anything else could be elimanated. Hope I've helped.	Health

Can sinusitis be caused by sublimations (eg. car accident)? . In otherwords, can sinusitis be caused by nerves being pinched between the vertebrae - sublimations? . i would say no. it usually is caused by allergies. Sinusitis is an inflammation of the lining of one or more of the sinus cavities in the facial bones around your nose. Sinusitis can make life miserable, causing tenderness in your face, aching behind your eyes and difficulty breathing through your nose.\n\nMost cases of sinusitis are acute infectious sinusitis, which generally lasts less than four weeks. If the signs and symptoms of sinusitis last more than 12 weeks, or if you have frequent bouts of sinusitis, you may have chronic sinusitis.\n\nChronic sinusitis is one of the most common chronic diseases in the United States, affecting an estimated 33 million people each year.

"Petitions? . Are petitions legal if you do them over the e-mail?I don't want to ban anything, I am just making a petition and I want to send it out.Will this be legal? . I'm not quite sure I understand the question. Petitions, in and of themselves, are legal. You can make a petition concerning almost anything, and get a bunch of people willing to sign their names to it, via email or otherwise. \n\nHowever, a petition itself is not an actual ""legal document""...it is merely a document stating that X number of citizens happen to take a stand on a particular issue and urge a legislator, official, etc. to act in their favor. For example, you can make a petition in favor of banning smoking, but just because you get a bunch of people to sign it, that doesn't mean that smoking will be banned. The petition itself has no legal standing. Now, if a legislator gets enough petitions all saying the same thing, he/she might WANT to do it if it is in his/her best political interest to do so. \n\nSo the answer to your question is yes.\n\nHope this helped somewhat."

what  is a vaccum flask? .  . Its a balloon of glass, shaped (usually) to be like a bottle. But unlike a balloon, the volume inside the glass has had all the air extracted before it was sealed (thus forming an airless environment known as a vacuum). \n\nIf there is no air in the space between the layers of glass there are no molecules present. Molecules are required to transfer heat. So if you put your hot soup in a vacuum flask it stays hot for a long time because the heat cannot escape. If you fill it with cold beer, the beer stays cold because the warmer air outside can't get in.\n\nSimple but effective.	Science & Mathematics

At the time of cell division only the chromatid number doubles.Inter phase is the resting phase intht phase no doubling tales place .It takes place at the early meta phase stage\nIn anaphase the polar fibers or spindle fibers get attached to chromosome near the centromere.Then while they are moving towars poles,each centromere splits and carries half chromosome or one  chromatid.The chromatid in telophase becomes a full chromosome\nSo 46 chromosoes become 92 and 92become 46at the end of telophase stage.Hope you got the point.

Transposition of the great vessels- who is the musard procedure named after? .  . Dr. Michael Gatzoulis of the Royal Brompton Hospital, London, England, working with Dr. Liu, examined 51 patients who 25 years ago had received the Mustard procedure in Toronto. They found that nearly a quarter of the sample were beginning to develop heart rhythm problems which, left untreated could lead to heart failure.\n\nThe Mustard procedure â developed by Dr. William Mustard with support from the Heart and Stroke Foundation of Canadaâ was the first operation to correct the congenital abnormality that produced âblue babies.\n\nBlue babies are born with a defect called transposition of the great vessels, in which blood from the lungs flows back to the lungs and blood from the body flows back to the body. The two major arteries coming out of the heart, the aorta and the pulmonary artery are connected to the wrong chambers. Such babies look blue because insufficient oxygen is circulating in their bodies.\n\nThe Mustard procedure restores the circulation but reverses the direction of the blood flow in the heart. In a normal heart, de-oxygenated, blue, blood is pumped into the lungs via the right ventricle. Then it is distributed throughout the body via the left ventricle. In the Mustard procedure, blood is pumped to the lungs via the left ventricle and disseminated throughout the body via the right ventricle.	Health

Try setting a max bid (what's the max you would pay for that dress).  If you lose don't worry, there's lots more for bid.  You could get a ""buy now"" deal so you don't have to wait.  From what I can see there aren't many bidders.  Be careful though, what you see is what you get (make sure you know about any defects beforehand). :)\n\nI hope it works out. :)"	Family & Relationships
"how I can reduce the wight through excrise,without medican? .  . Do you mean ""how can I reduce weight through excercise without medicine""?\n\nExcecise is the best way to reduce wieght, combined with attention to yor diet. This doesn't mean you have to starve - just follow a healthy, low fat diet. \n\nYou should aim to walk 10,000 steps each day - though you can start off gently! try to take a good walk for at least 20 minutes each day, and do some other exercise you enjoy. Swimming is excellent exercise. If you like aerobics, yoga etc, then do it. if you hate it, don't do it - but do find some way of getting regular exercise."	Health

Help 911 !!!!? . year ago i met with this girl from my laboratory courses .

Over look it and try to treat everyone the same even though it kinda hurts. Just talk to her like if it doesnt bother you. Only to Observe the way they interact with eachother and try to become BETTER than the way the other guy is. Try to be authentic and genuine. And pretend it doesn't bother you that she talks to him. Act cool about it as to somehow make her COME TO YOU to talk or whatever. MAke her come to you.	Health

Why do people abort babies/fetuses? . I don't care what the pope saids, so don't give me any of that pope's nonsince. I am a Baptist and some of us Baptist say that abortion is kill the baby/fetus. Only people that truely believe in God our Lord believes that killing a baby/fetus is a sin and it is. Don't give any nonsince that saids the baby/fetus doesn't have a heart beat, so it can't have a soul because that is where you are wrong my friend. Jesus was a baby/fetus at one time to, so do you believe he didn't have a soul when he was a few weeks old. I don't think so. Y'all can't hate me all y'all want. I'm Pro-Life. . I agree with you totally. Women should not abort babies just because they don't want them. They should have thought about that before they opened their legs. Abortion should be made illegal, that way women are more cautious when they decide to have sex. Babies happen, condoms break, it is not the baby's fault. The baby should not pay the ultimate price because of your lack of responsibility. Sex is a big responsibility and most people do not realize this. This is why I do not believe in pre-marital sex. I think sex should only be done when you are married because when you marry someone then you plan to have children. Abortion is wrong because it gives idiots a way to save their pathetic way of life.\n\nPS. If you are raped then I guess it is ok to abort because it wasn't your fault but other than that it is wrong.	Politics & Government

"how to cure yeast infections or vaginal odor at home? .  . Use over-the-counter treatments like vaginal suppositories/creams, you can clear it up in a few days. (A doctor can order a prescription pill to take also.)There are a couple of different kinds; if one ingredient doesn't work, try a different one. Also over-the-counter cortisone cream will relieve the itch. Stay clear of sweets, white ""carbs"" like bread and pasta, eat yogurt with acidophalus cultures included (kills yeast) or take the over-the-counter acidophalus capsules. Wear natural-fiber, loose fitting clothing and cotton panties/bras..this is VERY IMPORTANT. You want to keep the areas as dry as possible. You can apply cornstarch to soothe and dry the areas also. Don't use harsh soaps; try a bath in tipid water with 1/2 cup of oatmeal in a wash cloth tied with a rubberband. It's a great gentle cleanser and won't irritate your delicate skin. If you have an intimate partner, they will want to be treated also as you can pass this back and forth. Douching is not recommended while you're using your yeast medications vaginally.  In fact, too much douching can cause more irritation and then with only water or water with a tablespoon of white vinigar.  Hope this helps cause I know you must be miserable. God bless."	Health

OK....sellers realty costs are no more than 6% of the sales price of your home, and take it from a realtor...when you list your house, and you don't offer a good commission to the BUYERS agent, they won't even SHOW your house to their buyers, so you can basically concider your home blacklisted and it will not be shown.  So unless you already have a buyer lined up to purchase your home, you really need to get an agent.  Not all of them are annoying, but there are always a few that give the rest of us a bad name.  Plus, when a buyer buys a home from a *for sale by owner* the buyers agent knows they will be doing the work of both sides and again, we avoid that at all costs.  Why should we work double duty and then only get paid for one side, and its usually only 1.5%-2% commission anyway? No thank you..so bottom line...get an agent.  Interview 3 or 4 and find one who's personality you can get along with.  There are a lot of very good, honest agents out there and with the right one you can have a smooth job of selling your home.  Good Luck!"	Business & Finance

So first, let's group all the x terms together and y terms together.\n\nx^2 - 4x + y^2 + 2y = 4\n\nTo complete the square, we have to add 4 to the x terms and 1 to the y terms.

In the above case, the center is at (2,-1), since you take the negative of -2 (the value next to the x) and 1 (the value next to the y).\n\nTo get the radius, you take the square root of the right hand side, so the square root of 9 is 3."

Virtually every farm consists of one crop:  they are enormously specialized.  When you drive by the fields, they are row on row of the exact same variety of the exact same product, all the same size, separated by uniform spaces, all very automated.  They are clean and efficient, and many of them are certified organic.  It makes me mad when people are critical of ""agribusiness.""

Finding out about old electronic components on the Net, where's best? . I have a number of real old electronic components, mostly IC's (Integrated Circuits) of various sizes and types.\n\nWay back when I got them, I never thought I would have to use them again this long into the future, and back then we just had books and data sheets, now I have no idea where the books and data sheets are and hope the Net can show me the way.\n\nSo besides having a magnifying glass and some tweezers, can anyone suggest some really good sites for getting the data on what I have and how to use it?\n\nOr is best just to chuck them (Integrated Circuits, etc) away and get modern? . digikey.com is the best for new parts. Old parts are ok sometimes, but new ones will do the same tasks faster, with less power, and with more functions.

"Attn Kobe haters??? Iverson vs Bryant??? . ok, this isn't a question of one on one, but why is it that Kobe is considered a ""ball-hog"" for scoring points & for winning the scoring title last year, but yet Iverson averages more points per game and has won the scoring title numerous of times.  How come no one considers him a ""ball-hog""?  Does this have to do with all the Kobe haters out there? Does Iverson make his teammates better? I don't think so!!!  In ten seasons, Iverson has 19115 pts as opposed to Bryant 10seasons 16866 & 3 rings!!!   So y the name calling? . LMAO, yo this Kobe Bryant impostor really cracks me up, dude you're funny! Anyway, I think people do call Iverson a ball-hog also, I just don't think they hate him as much as they hate Kobe. Kobe is one of those guys that you either love or hate, there is no middle road. I was reading an article that asked for the most hated and the most loved player (just two of many categories) and Kobe was the only player to be in the top 5 of both lol. It really doesn't matter what Kobe does, people will always find a way to hate him simply because they have nothing better to do. The Kobe impostor did have one thing correct though, Kobe is currently the best player in the world!"	Sports
How can I improve my coordination? How can I improve at lacrosse? . I am really bad with coordination. I seriously can't even walk and drink water at the same time. I have to stop and take a drink. I'm in lacrosse, and I am honestly really terrible at it. I constantly drop the ball, miss a catch, or am just plain clumsy. So my question is this: is coordination something a person is born with, and some have it, and others don't? Or is there a way to improve my coordination? How would I go about improving at lacrosse or just coordination in general? . With lacrosse the way I improved my coordination was playing wall-ball.\n\nI would spend hours and hours throwing against a brick wall, but when you do it don't be flat footed, keep moving your feet, and use both hands, even if you are terrible.\n\nIf you do it long enough you do get much better.\n\nI would also take my stick and ball out when i went for jogs around the local park and would cradle the whole way, changing hands, and throwing ball out in front and charge for the ground ball.\n\nIt works really well.\n\nWhen playing wall-ball mix it up a bit as well. Play long balls (not near any glass windows, I learnt that the hard way) some days and short balls on others.	Sports

have you heard of schlerdoma? (spell check)? .  . From emedicine:  Scleroderma is a systemic disease that affects many organ systems. It is most obvious in the skin; however, the gastrointestinal tract, the respiratory, renal, cardiovascular, and genitourinary systems, as well as numerous vascular structures, are involved frequently. The symptoms result from progressive tissue fibrosis and occlusion of the microvasculature by excessive production and deposition of types I and III collagens. Other macromolecules found in the connective tissue (eg, glycosaminoglycans, tenascin, fibronectin) also are increased. The vascular alterations show a predilection for affecting the small arteries, arterioles, and capillaries. The small vessel cytoskeleton is affected by structural defects that lead to collapse. Next, the tight junctions become altered and are no longer functional, allowing the endothelium to slip into the vessel lumen.\n\nFrom webmd:  Scleroderma (pronounced SKLEER-oh-der-ma) is Greek for hard skin. It's classified as both a connective-tissue disorder and a rheumatic condition. In scleroderma, the skin gradually tightens and thickens or hardens. It loses its ability to stretch. Tiny blood vessels throughout the body also may be affected, causing widespread damage to the internal organs.	Health

does mathematics have any thing to say on homosexual activites. concerning whether they be normal or otherwis? .  . Maybe. Ok folks, this is always a touchy matter and I don't want to step on anyone's sensitivities. If I do, I appologize.\n \nFasten your seatbelt and prepare for trippin'. This is a theory I've developed and been toying arond with based on my little knowlege of social biology and Discovery Channel watching (specially the altruistic acts of some rodents that commit mass suicide).\n \nImagine a fish tank that can support a population of 100 adult fishes and you put a couple in it.\n \nTo predict its population, you could borrow from physics, the Simple Harmonic Motion model (damped, critically damped or overdamped). But sometimes, the system might assume a chaotic behavior. This is described in a book by James Gleick about the history of the chaos theory and its development.\n \nWell, according to this, the tanks population can reach well over 100 fast and then, almost all fishes would die and the population would reach zero or nearly zero. Only to grow again and restart the whole process. So instead of reaching 100 in a well behaved manner, it would become a chaotic system and risk extinction of that population, since everytime it drops drastically, it could easily be wiped out by mere chance that the few fishes get killed by other causes than over population.\n  \nOkay, that was the math part. Now imagine that nature equips species with a dampning mechanism that could be switched on and off as populational pressure increases. As the population increases and approaches 100, more and more fishes would become gay as a mean of birth control. In the event that that population be drasticaly reduced (by a plague for example) some of the gay fish could reverse back to straight and assure the survival of the species. You could say that gayness is the fertility stocked.\n \nIt would be interesting to observe if gay people have reverted back to staight after huge populational drops (and after the cause has gone away). For example, after the tsunami's wake has diminished and routine is somewhat restored, some local populations will still be very smaller than before the tradegy. Some might be endangered of extinction. It will be interesting to observe if there will be a reversal as my little theory predicts. \n \nThere's more social biology than math in this, but it only works with the chaotic process in mind.\n \n \n____________________\nAnswer to Emilyrose's edit:\nEmily, I picked-up the population-conditional behavior idea from some documentary I've seen some 20 or 25 yrs ago (yeah, I'm old) which, unfortunatly I really can't remember or vouch for. What I remember was a segment with lab rats, in which they observed the exact same thing I'm using: they start out with a cage with a small population that can easily survive in its space and food and rations available. The rats displayed heterosexual behavior. After the population is drastically increased, they all become homosexual (your observation of a would be binary transition is not addressed here). It did not discuss the possibility of reversion, either. \n \nThe trasition can be considered reasonable if you make an analogy to your fruit fly example: not all fruit flies change sex at once. Something simillar happens with guppies, if there are no males, one or two females change sex. But I don't think the go back afterwards.\n \nFinnaly, as to you're last observation, that if an individual with homosexual tendencies would not pass it on, that doesn't matter if you consider a social biology framework. (I know it's frowned upon and even it's proponent backed out, but that's only b/c they cut off his grants.) Suppose (for the sake of it) that the gay behavior is controlled by one or more genes that can switch on and off. My theory, is that a gene pool that had these set of genes would be in advantage in comparison to one that didn't.\n \nOne more thing, so that ppl won't think I'm advocating anything: my swi	Science & Mathematics

I am pretty thin, but whats the best exercise for me? . I would like to have a flat stomach, well defined muscles.. IDK to look good and healthy . I had a professional measure and calculate different exercises for me in terms of most calories burned in shortest period of time.  Based on their calculations an eliptical machine was the best.  It was superior to treadmills, walking, swimming, bicycling and many other activities I had them check for me.  An eliptical machine gives a good cardio work out while you utilize your legs, arms, abs and many other muscles.  It is a smooth movement which keeps you from suffering impact injuries that can be associated with jogging and running.  So I say if your goal is weight loss or stabalization an eliptical is a good choice.  I combine my use of an eliptical with racquet ball, swimming, walking, bicycling, weight training, and yoga.  The combination is great!  For fastest calorie burn it's the eliptical.  All depends on what you want out of your exercise.	Health
In what year did Mexico get it's independence? .  . In 1821. Earlier attempts at independence had been foiled by royalist forces and the backing of the colony's creole elite. Two earlier revolutions  by Jose Maria Morelos and Miguel Hidalgo had been crushed. A declaration of independence was made by acongress organized by Morelos however his revolution failed in 1815. A successful independence movement was formed when the formerly royalist commander, Col. Augustin Iturbide, allied with the revolutionary leader Vicente Guerrero in 1820. This alliance forged the Plan de Iguala and created the Army of the Three Guarantees (Religion, Independencia, Union). The creole elites which had been royalists during the earlier attemps favored the Iturbide/Guerrero plan and independence.	Politics & Government
"I need help really bad for my laptop keyboard.? . The keys on my laptop keeping turning on and off. Im in the middle of typing an essay for school then the 6,7,Delete,Ctrl,-_,+=, Buttons will stop working. I have no clue what is wrong. . When it comes to their computers, many people take their keyboards for granted. However, the keyboard is an integral part of your computer (read: itâs hard to input anything without one!), so some care must be exercised when using it. The following are some helpful hints for basic keyboard care, as well as some common troubleshooting problems and possible solutions. \n\n\nKeyboard Is Dirty \n\n\n \nKeyboards should be cleaned with ""spray-n-wipe"" cleaner and a cloth or tissue on a monthly basis. Ensure that computer is not powered up while cleaning the keyboard. Compressed air can also be used to clean between the keyboard keys. Another tip: clean the keys with a cotton swab dipped in alcohol. \n\n\n""Keyboard Not Found"" Message \n\n\nYour keyboard is not plugged into the computer securely. Unplug it and plug it back in and the problem should go away. If this doesn't work, follow procedure: âComputer isn't taking inputs from keyboardâ (below). \n\n\nKey Is Stuck \n\n\n1. If a key does not work or is stuck in the down position, you may try to remove it with a CPU ""chip puller"" tool. These simple ""L"" shaped tools are great at pulling out keys. Once you've pulled out the stuck key, you can try to stretch the spring to ""reanimate"" its action. \n\n\nComputer Isn't Taking Inputs From Keyboard \n\n\n1. Is keyboard connected to computer? Ensure that the keyboard is plugged into the keyboard jack and not into the mouse jack. If the keyboard was unplugged, plug it back in and reboot the computer. \n\n2. If the keyboard still doesn't work on boot-up, power down the computer and try to borrow a friendâs known-good keyboard for troubleshooting. Plug the new keyboard up and boot up the computer. If the new keyboard works, the old keyboard is bad and needs to be replaced. \n\n3. If the known-good keyboard doesn't work, check your BIOS to make sure it sees the keyboard. It should say, ""installed."" If the BIOS recognizes the keyboard, then you probably have a bad keyboard port. \n\n\nI Plugged Keyboard Into Mouse Port \n\n\n1. Many mice and keyboards today use a PS/2 connector. If you plugged your keyboard into the mouse port (or vice versa), follow steps 2 and 3. \n\n2. Shut down the computer and plug the keyboard into the keyboard port. The keyboard port is usually marked with a ""keyboard"" symbol. Plug the mouse into the mouse port (usually marked with a mouse symbol). \n\n3. Reboot the computer; the keyboard should work now. If keyboard doesn't work, check your BIOS to make sure the BIOS recognizes the keyboard. You should see the words, ""installed"" or ""enabled"" under the keyboard. \n\n4. If the BIOS recognizes the keyboard but it still doesn't work, you may have a bad keyboard port. \n\n\nI Spilled a drink on my keyboard! \n\n\n1. If you spill any liquid in the keyboard, turn it upside down ASAP. Drain all the water out of the keyboard, shaking it if necessary. If you've spilled water into the keyboard, just let it dry. You may use a hair dryer to dry out area under the keys (remember, too much heat and you could damage the electrical components). \n\n2. If you've spilled a soda into the keyboard, completely rinse it in warm water. No soap please! You may use a hair dryer at this point or just let it dry for 2 days. Ensure the keyboard is perfectly DRY before you attempt to use it again. Don't plug a wet keyboard into electrical equipment. Think safety. \n\n5. If the keyboard still doesn't work, replace the keyboard. \n\n\nOnly Types Capitals \n\n\nUSUALLY THIS IS CAUSED BY THE ""CAPS LOCK"" KEY BEING LEFT ON. PRESS ""CAPS LOCK"" KEY ONCE to fix this problem. \n\n\nPage Up/Page Down Keys Are Locked \n\n\nYour ""Scroll Lock"" function may be engaged. Press the Scroll Lock Key once. \n\n\nLetters on Keyboard Don't Work \n\n\nCheck to see if there are any obstructions to th"	Computers & Internet

France and Argentina were the top favorites to win the cup, but they were eliminated in the first round. and what South Korea did? they played in the semi-final!\n\nwell, temperament will be the name of the game as soon as the world cup begins. tradition will come second. for such reasons, only 5 countries lifted the world cup for 15 times out of 17 tournaments followed by 2 countries won one time each.\n\nin my opinion, top contenders of this Germany 2006 are Brazil, Argentina, Germany and Italy. Holland could be the dark horse of the tournamentand hence, should be watch out carefully. If Wayne Rooney becomes match fit to play, England should be considered as a top contender too.\n\nAny of the above top contenders could win the world cup 2006.	Sports

My university course sucks. Can I get my tuition fees back? .

I figured if I was going to make a film, why not do it as part of a university course and get a degree out of it?\n\nBut the course was advertised as a 'Taught MA' and the only contact I had was 8 weeks of seminars at the start, doing 3 modules that were optional for me, and none had anything to do with film.

Plus they do not like lending me cameras when I have filming to do - I get them for very short amounts of time and must prove it is for academic work.\n\nI can't believe I paid Â£3000 for this. If I drop out now, even at this relatively late stage, could I get my fees back? . Well I had the very same problem on MA Fine Art. The course tutors didn't turn up for tutorials and when they turned up for seminars they were either asleep or drunk!!! NO lie. So I wrote to the Dean of Faculty and complained. He didn't respond, and I refused to pay the outstanding fees when I dropped off the course 10 weeks before the end. They tried to pursue those fees through a solicitor but I refused for three years. They didn't take it further. What I should have done, and regret, was write to the adjudicating board that monitor that college. You should do that!\n\nI wasted Â£10,000 on that course - that is how much I had to borrow.\n\nGood luck!	Education & Reference

The reason for this is as follows:\nFrom Eulers identity (mentioned above) we know that \ne^i*x  = cos(x) + i*sin(x)  \nso, as a result\ne^i*n*pi = cos(n*pi) + i*sin(n*pi)\nbut note that when n is an odd number\ncos(n*pi) is always -1    and\nsin(n*pi) is always 0.\nso the sum is always -1.\n\nResult #2 is that we can rewrite e^i*pi = -1 as\ne^i*pi + 1 = 0\n\nThis gives us e, i, pi, 1 and 0, five of the most fundamental numbers of mathematics, in one tidy pakage!\n\nBeautiful indeed!

Question about a chipped tooth (Root Canal)? . I recently had a root cancal done, but it takes awhile to receive the crown.\n\nAnyways I was playing soccer with my friend. I was chasing the ball, tripped up, and stomped the ground. My teeth clamped together. I felt a small piece of my tooth (Molar) chipp off from the tooth that was worked on. I looked at it through a mirror, and a small bit of tooth and filling was gone. Will I have to have the filling taken out, and a new one put it? Or will they cover it up, and put the crown on?  I just need a little info on what will happen, Thanks. . It depends.  I take it that you had the crown preparation done and right now you have a temporary crown on.  You may have just chipped part of the temporary because it is not that strong.  If this is the case, it is no big deal.  If you chipped off part of the build up material, (which is what the dentist put on to build up the tooth and then shaved down the tooth to make the 'peg' that the crown will go on).  If this is chipped a little the crown can still go on okay, but if you chipped alot then it may need to be replaced and possibly a new crown be made, so that is fits perfectly.  Your dentist will need to see you to determine what needs to be done.  I think you should be okay, but it never good to just assume!	Health

Best one so far was a company that gave away their t-shirts and had us scan the crowd for people wearing the shirt and awarded a cash prize to people seen wearing it at the convention.

Is the Air conditioning in the gym counter productive when working out( weight training and cardio)? . Is the Aircon in the gym counter productive when doing weight training and cardio? I know obviously it makes you sweat less but does that mean the workout is less effective? or is it an internal temperature thing that is independent of the temperature outside the body? since alot of high quality gyms have aircon nowadays, its those cheap (no offense, I use to go there my self) gyms which let's you pay per session no membership don't have Aircon...\n\nDoes it mean less calories burned or something?? pls justify your answer and if possible site sources if any, thanks in advance! . The productive effect of your exercise has to do with the muscles and the effort they exert. Sweating is not a body-building process, it is a temperature-regulation process to dump waste heat generated by your activities.  Your central nervous system starts to break down if your internal body temperature rises above 107 or so! \n\nYour exercise program builds you up by proper use of the muscle groups in a planned manner.  The only difference in your physiology when there is AC around, is a slightly lower loss of water and of the body salts that go with sweat.  If it makes you more comfortable as you exercise, and encourages you to keep to your program, it may make for a much better training experience.	Health

"What must it take for a seed to grow? . Do you need  carbon doixide for a plant to grow? . Most seeds contain less than 20% water, as opposed to about 80% in growing tissues. Most of the water in seeds is bound to macromolecules, so that little is available for metabolic reactions. Cellular membranes are disorganized under these conditions. Because the water potential of seeds is extremely low they are capable of drawing water from soils that have too little water to support normal plant growth. As the seed imbibes water cell membranes reorganize and metabolism begins. However, the seed may not germinate at this point. In addition to water, many seeds require a period of cold exposure (stratification) or leaching of inhibitors by water before germination is possible. This applies particularly to wild species; many cultivated plants have been selected for ease of germination. During seed development dormancy is associated with an increase in abscisic acid; this dormancy can often be broken artificially by treatment with GA.\n\nGermination in some seeds is promoted by ethylene. This could be related to an ecological response to fire which occurs naturally in many biomes. Burning vegetation generates trace amounts of ethylene and clears the ground for colonization by new plants.\n\nMany seeds require light for germination; much of our understanding of phytochrome physiology derives from experiments with lettuce seeds in which germination is stimulated by red light and inhibited by far-red. Under phytochrome control seeds that are buried in the soil will not germinate unless the soil is turned over so that they are exposed to light. This is part of the theory behind ""no-till"" crop production and recent ideas that it might be a good idea to plow at night!"	Science & Mathematics

I'm not aware of this particular company, but to the extent that it claims that it can help you recover long lost property belonging to you or your family, these are usually scams.  Before you give this company any money or personal information, you will want to contact the Better Business Bureau AND the Texas Attorney General's Office to see what records they have on such a company.  You will also want to contact the Texas Secretary of State, which should handle business registrations for legitimate businesses operating in Texas.  If the business is listed with the Texas AG's Office, it is likely not a legitimate business since the attorneys general in all states keep records on bad guys whom they have had to investigate.  If it is listed with the Better Business Bureau, check to see what, if any reports have been made against it.  It may be listed with the BBB because it is a member in good standing, or it may be listed because it has been the subject of negative reporting before.  Best of luck to you.

What's the POLITICAL difference between a Christian American & a non-Christian American? . Why can't Christian Americans be political without enduring the bitterness of the moral bankrupt?  This is a question that I would like some intelligent answers to.  If you can't do anything but name-calling, don't answer. . As a Christian, I'd say that the morally bankrupt don't want us to speak out because they don't want to be limited by our morality.  I would say that most non-Christains are morally sound, but there IS evil in the world. One cannot be an active Christian in any context without being attacked, because darkness hates the light.  That's why we have to put on the armour of God every day.\nI'd also say that I'm a moderate Democrat, and I know Christians who are liberal Democrats.  It is too bad that some people in any belief system can't tolerate those who disagree with them, even when it's a matter of opinion and not morality.	Society & Culture

You can select which portion of the registry you want to scan for errors.  CCleaner will create a registry backup before cleaning anything.  It doesn't do a deep scan but it is free.  Fred Langa recommends EasyCleaner but I've used it and found CCleaner found more errors and gave me more control over what to scan and fix.

"In what religion is evolution a taught doctrine? . Separation of Church and State? Keep religion out of schools? Evolution is a tenet of a particular religion -yet taught in schools under the guise of science- name the religion. . Evolution is a science in which the principles are continuously questioned, tested, and revised as new information is acquired.  The fact that some religions such as Hinduism are more compatible with evolutionary theory does not make it a product of the religion.    Secular Humanism, if you even qualify it as a religion, has adopted it, but did not create it.  If a pastor felt that Newtonian physics should be taught alongside the Ten Commandments, it would not make it religious doctrine.  Evolution can be studied without any attempt to prove or disprove the existence of God.\n\nIn summary, enough of your meaningless rhetoric.  Evolution belongs in schools, the Bible belongs in religious classes and parochial schools, and ""Scientific"" Creationism (but not Creationism) belongs in the trash."	Society & Culture

why do i keep getting chest infections? . in the last 6 weeks i`ve had 5 chest infections. they knock me for 6 everytime. i woke up feeling really rough again this morning and have no energy yet again. anyone any idea`s or am i just unlucky? . The combinations of being stressed out and smoking are two big risk factors for infections and many illnesses.  Being stressed out lowers the effectiveness of your immune system so that it is easier for you to get an infection.  At the same time, being a smoker makes people more prone to chest infections.  This is because the lungs contain something called cilia, microscopic, finger-like projections in the lungs that help move mucus that contains debris and other things like bacteria that has been inhaled.  When someone smokes, the chemicals in the cigarette basically paralize the cilia so that they cannot move the mucus and bacteria up out of the lungs.  This is why smokers get what is known as smoker's cough.  It is their body trying to get rid of all the nasty stuff that has accumilated in their lungs.  \n\nSo, you have two risk factors against you, the stress and the smoking.  Next comes bronchitis and possibly pneumonia.  After that, your lung cells are at risk of mutating and becoming something between normal cells and cancer cells.  At this stage, you can still stop smoking and your cells can go back to a relitively normal state and your cilia will be active once again. But after lung cells have changed to cancer cells, they cannot be changed back but only distroyed to prevent more cancer cells.  I would very much so recommend you stop smoking.  It may seem in the short run that it is helping you cope with stress, but in the long run it is causing you more by allowing you to get so many chest infections and other problems in the future.  \n\nI know this all seems harsh, but it is the truth.  Better you find out the truth so that you can stop things from happening to you before they do.  I hope everything goes well for you.\n\nAnother thing, taking antibiotics too often can cause the germs in your body that do survive to become resistent to the antibiotics.  This can basically create a super germ that antibiotics can no longer kill, and if that germ multiplies, well then you have a stronger germ that can't be killed by antibiotics.  It also makes you more prone to germs in hospitals.  Some doctor's have been known to give out antibiotics way more than neccisary, so I recommend you to read the article i have provided in the sources below.\n\nEDIT: it seems to me you should go see a phyciatrist.  I know there are certain stresses out there that are unavoidable, but being able to talk to someone and possibly getting on a medication that can help calm you might help out.  And everytime you pick up a cigarette, try to make yourself think of some of the things I have said, mainly that the cigarette is making you more stressed in the long run and that you would be way more stressed out than you are now if you had pnemonia or lung cancer on top of all of that.  Best of wishes to you.	Health
Ok the new Speaker of Congress, Nancy Pelosi could her bad decisions lately be related to a natural process? . Ok my dad and I and my boyfriend and my little brother were stuck in traffic returning home.  The boys were plugged in to their I pods and in another world lol lol but my dad and I were discussing politics.  My dad is an independent but he votes mostly for Republicans and apparently doesnt like Nancy Pelosi.  Ok I read about this too in the news so Im not unaware of it.  She tried to appoint some guy as her assistant who has been in trouble before.  Plus she wants to kick this Congresswoman out of the intelligence committe who is really smart and according to my dad does a great job and who HE WOULD vote for in favor of a guy who used to be a judge but got fired because he was passing on police information to a criminal in Florida.  My dad used colorful language that I wont repeat cause I just got a violation and dont want another one.  It refers to a woman or girl having severe physical symptoms to a natural process.  Is he right?  Could that have clouded her judgement . You bet.  This is why a woman president would be bad; we'd have a new war once a month.	Health
