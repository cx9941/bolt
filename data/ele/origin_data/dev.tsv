I bought this product because of the selection of sounds it offered , having listened to the samples provided online . However , the main reason for purchase was as a white noise machine for my night 's sleep . I thought it was a good plus that it also came with an alarm clock . While I did appreciate the functionality that you could set the alarm for any sound you wish -LRB- go to sleep with white noise but wake up with wind chimes -RRB- , I was dissatisfied with the sound quality of the white noise or the brightness of the display . I could discern the loop in the white noise - it was not continuous or smooth . In fact , I got one of the most restless nights of sleep using this machine . Overall , if you 're looking for a sound machine with lots of interesting noises , this is for you . If you 're looking for a white noise machine this is not for you . 	Alarm Clock
The pink moonbeam clock was given to my best friend for her birthday . It was the perfect gift as she wanted a simple alarm clock that was easy to operate and see . She loved the pink color ! 	Alarm Clock
Easy to use . Good quality so far . A quiet clock at night . The alarm is loud enough . Overall a good bedside alarm clock for the price . 	Alarm Clock
This clock was even more than I expected it to be . It is fully electric with a battery backup . The 3 types of wakeup sounds are crystal clear and very interesting . Timex 's reputation is even higher in my mind now that I own this clock . 	Alarm Clock
the clock was a gift from Santa for my 7 year old daughter . It is an adorable clock , really looks nice . However , the on\/off switch for the alarm feature does NOT BUDGE . It just sort of bends in the right direction , but does n't click over . I unscrewed the back to see if I could figure out why -LRB- because I really wanted to keep the clock -RRB- , but it appears the lever base is made of a flimsy piece of metal so it lacks the `` snap '' needed to actually function as a switch . Have to return ... daughter will be disappointed , but hope to find another pink clock to replace . 	Alarm Clock
I 've had 3 of these clocks over the past 15 years . My 2nd one just died after several hard years of use ... traveling literally around the world multiple times . Was sooo happy to find a new one on Amazon . This clock is the perfect size -LRB- smaller than a business card -RRB- , it lights up with the press of the big `` light '' button , and it 's easy to change the time & alarm . And it does n't make unwanted beeping noises every time you want to press a button . They have been very durable and ... best of all ... it slides very easily into a briefcase or shaving kit bag . It 's perfect for the business traveler ! 	Alarm Clock
Good product , does everything it is advertised to do . I can set alarms for different days easily . Only drawback is that the clock has a small display which can be hard to see from across the room . 	Alarm Clock
This is a great travel alarm ! It 's exactly what I was looking for . It 's tiny -LRB- 21\/2 '' x 13\/4 '' x 1\/2 '' -RRB- and the alarm is loud -LRB- I sleep with ear plugs , so I need something to wake me through them -RRB- . However , I ca n't imagine it would be too loud for those who do n't . It 's very easy to set and the night light is bright . And the price is right . I 'm very , very satisfied . 	Alarm Clock
I bought this for my parents -LRB- 88 and 95 -RRB- so they can see the time easily when they wake up at night . It has many other features but they just like the very large numbers and the strong elimination . 	Alarm Clock
I had three main criteria in mind when selecting this clock -LRB- two of them , actually -RRB- for our bedside tables . This product ended up defying all three criteria . You could say that the buyer is to blame , but the rub of buying on the internet is that you have to take a leap of faith that the product will function as it is supposed to . In this case , that leap was right off of a cliff . What I wanted : 1 -RRB- An attractive , retro look that would blend in with our bedroom : yeah , sure , this product has that chrome look and a retro-ish design , but its tiny size makes it seem more like a travel alarm clock , and the cheap materials show in the appearance . 2 -RRB- An easy-to-read face that would allow me to see the time quickly when I have to get up at night to feed our baby : the light on this clock is so lame that you can still barely see the numbers . Also , one of the clocks we received broke several times within the first few days , so my husband just started using his iPhone as an alarm . 3 -RRB- An effective alarm that does n't blow your eardrums out : this alarm does n't blow your eardrums out ... BECAUSE IT DOES N'T WORK . Not once has the alarm on the one remaining functional clock actually gone off at the time we set it -LRB- or at all -RRB- . Piece of crap . Waste of money . Now I will be spending another 40 dollars to buy digital alarm clocks again . Boo . 	Alarm Clock
Left my previous travel-size alarm clock in Paris and went through a couple different ones -LRB- slight more expensive -RRB- before I got this guy . I am very satisfied . It is very compact -LRB- travel + + + -RRB- , cheap -LRB- always a + -RRB- , and pretty simple . Everything has dedicated controls . My only issue is the same `` feel '' of the display and alarm on\/off control , so I have missed alarms occasionally because I simply slid the wrong slider -LRB- display control instead of setting the alarm slider to ON -RRB- . Still like it a lot after about six months . 	Alarm Clock
Where to start . No warranty , no instructions . Would not set time automatically . Focus knob simply rotated ; did not focus . Without instructions is difficult to set up . Worth maybe $ 10 for the projection , no more . Overall , cheap , cheap , cheap . Poor example for Lacrosse ; will avoid them from now on . Very disappointed , 	Alarm Clock
Its not a big clock , its around 12 inches . The light turn red when you push the head . I really like it . The only thing i didnt like its that the alarm has a very low sound . 	Alarm Clock
Product arrived in a timely fashion . The `` inside box '' - a.k.a the manufacturers box was a lil banged up , corner of the box was crumpled . Product still works fine though . 	Alarm Clock
Sure , it 's just a clock . A reproduction of a 1930 's clock . Jeez , it 's analog in a digital world . It is n't uber-cool matte black or made of titanium . Besides accurately telling the time and having an effective alarm , its only other features are a flashing light and a battery back-up . Most would think `` nothing special here . '' But , unexpectedly , there is something kind of special about this . There is some subtle set of elements that combine to please me whenever I look at this clock . Nothing spectacular or even all that explicable ... the feeling evoked is just pleasant ... like seeing a girl 's ponytail jauntily bouncing , like your favorite coffee cup with filled with just the right temperature coffee , like a puppy rolling on its back to look at you . Kind of corny ? Sure ... but nice nevertheless . 	Alarm Clock
My brother loved his lego Darth Vader , when you take it out of the package he says it looks like ep 3 where Anakin becomes Darth Vader . `` PADME !! '' 	Alarm Clock
This is a well made product that is going strong after months of use . My son loves checking the time before he gets out of bed . The only `` downside '' is that the clock makes a beeping sound if the light to check the display is activated . I find that it 's helpful that it is n't consistently back lit , which makes the room darker and more sleep-friendly , but the `` beep '' can be annoying to those who are light sleepers like I am . 	Alarm Clock
Easy to set , durable , travels well . Exactly what I needed . Seems like it will last for years . 	Alarm Clock
I enjoy the simplcity , yet accuracy of our Elgin . Also it is light and easy to carry on trips , and not subject to power outages . Also like being able to see the dials in the dark if need be . 	Alarm Clock
This clock gains about 5 minutes every 4 days or so . I have an old digital plug-in clock that keeps perfect time , but the alarm does n't work . I bought this one for the alarm , but usually have to reset the time to match the old plug-in about twice a week . Also , if it gets dropped or knocked off the table , you have to reset the time . I 've had 2 or 3 other clocks of this type that keep perfect time , maybe gain a minute or two every 6 months . I would not buy another Timex . 	Alarm Clock
My husband is a HUGE SW fan who received this for his birthday . He was THRILLED ! Great looking toy , with the bonus of being a clock\/mp3 player\/etc . Good stuff ! 	Alarm Clock
This clock mounts on a wall easily although screws for doing so are not included . I wish the alarm was a little bit louder but it is adequate . it is very easy to set and the large numbers make it easy to read . 	Alarm Clock
For the rest is has a good alarm . \/ Por lo que resta tiene una buena alarma . 	Alarm Clock
The clock is very cute , and I like seeing it on my bedside stand . But I am very near-sighted and during the night , without my glasses , I can barely see the face in order to tell the time , unless I have it about six inches away ; the backlighting is rather pathetic . In addition , there should be more distinction between the minute and hour hands , as even with glasses on during day it can be difficult to tell whether it 's 10:12 or 1:40 ! Finally , the light did n't wake me up - it might have if the room had been dark . The alarm terrified both my cats , right off the bed . So I tried covering the alarm with small pillow , and slept through it . Part of the problem was that I was wearing earplugs , but I wish there were a way to adjust the loudness of the alarm . I 'm really disappointed , and would reiterate that the clock needs brighter backlight , or an adjustable brightness feature , and one of the hands needs to be thicker to distinguish between them . I 'll keep , but not happy about it . 	Alarm Clock
I did by the adapter to plug it in a a few extra bird cards . I really enjoy waking up to the sound of birds every morning . It brings a little sunshine to cold Wisconsin winters . Over all it is a good product and I am glad I bought it . 	Alarm Clock
This is such an attractive clock . Numbers shine bright in a variety of colors . It gets my pre teen up . Amazing . She tries to beat the alarm . haha !! Works great !! Wonderful gift idea . 	Alarm Clock
Plenty of sounds to choose from . Drowns out the sounds of the outside world . My only complaint is the brightness of the clock . I have to turn it a way from me while I 'm sleeping . 	Alarm Clock
My daughter is so picky , we could not find her an alarm clock in sooo many different stores , but when I show it to her online she likes it and when we riceve it she loves it . The vibration under her pillow allows her yunger sister who sleep with her stay sleeping when my older should be awake for school it very nice gift and so convenieance ! 	Alarm Clock
small and very portable . but the alarm is loud ... the price is very appropriate 	Alarm Clock
We know our 18 year old likes his Star Wars Lego clock because he set the time and then commented `` I really like my Storm Trooper '' as he walked by his graduation display a few days after the party . : -RRB- Backlight comes on when head is pressed , but does not stay on , so battery should last a long time . Surprisingly stable in standing position . Extremities articulated in same fashion as a Lego character . 	Alarm Clock
One of a variety of Star Wars character Lego clocks that I have purchased ... the Stormtrooper is pretty cool . Press his head down and the clock backlight lights up the LCD screen . This is a yellow color and a bit disappointing . The armor is not quite right in color - it could be a bit whiter . My wife does not agree with me , she prefers the off white color - and my mate reckons the trooper must be based at Tatooine . Still , the trooper is pretty cool and a conversation starter . 	Alarm Clock
Exactly what I wanted and needed for an unbelievably low cost . You do n't have to be a computer specialist or even know what `` digital '' means to use it . Thank heavens I now have one thing which my grandaughter does n't have to put together or set in motion for me . 	Alarm Clock
Too bad there 's no option to keep it on !!! The time only displays for a few seconds after you clap\/make noise and then it 's off . You might be applauding a lot if you 're often interested in the time . Otherwise , I love the way it looks and its size is perfect for my desk space . 	Alarm Clock
Come on , it 's Darth Vadar , what 's not to like ? You can pound his head to get the night light to come on and better see the time . Basic functions but all work well so far ! He 's had it for a month . Really cute and he can sit or stand . `` I 'm your alarm clock Luke '' . I never knew Darth was made in China until now . That explains a lot ! 	Alarm Clock
The screen is only readable from a very high angle , almost right above . The light is nearly nonexistent . I 'm sure it keeps time -- I just ca n't tell : P 	Alarm Clock
It arrived and worked as promised . The only negative is that the light does not light up enough to see the time at night when you push the button . 	Alarm Clock
I bought this clock for my mother who is now 84 and coping with macular degeneration . She loves it and says it 's easy to see . Autumn 2010 : Mom had to go into a nursing home last year , alas , but the clock still continues to function as it should . Still a good buy here . 2012 : Still working and still remarkably accurate . 	Alarm Clock
Very sleek looking and functioning alarm clock . We like that it has lots of different sounds to choose from so we do n't have to have the standard annoying alarm sound in the morning . Another great feature , is that you can program 2 seperate alarms , so if you and your partner get up at different times in the morning you can set both alarms for 2 different times -LRB- and even different sounds -RRB- . Plus not have to worry about forgetting to re-set or accidentally turning the other alarm one off . 	Alarm Clock
I just ca n't seem to find an atomic travel alarm that satisfies all my needs . I have a lot of confidence in Lacrosse but this digital alarm clock does n't really meet the standard of a Lacrosse time piece . I do n't know what I expected but the product I received seems a little cheap looking . Unlike the expensive Casio clock I purchased a while ago -LRB- which , by the way , has a mind of its own regarding time zones , -RRB- the control buttons on this clock are easier to use and the instructions are even on the clock . Will it work for me ? I suppose so , but it definitely is not a product to become excited about . 	Alarm Clock
I received this product as a birthday gift and I LOVE IT ! Each morning I wake up before the alarm portion goes off -LRB- just the light portion is activated -RRB- and it is so much more peaceful than any other alarm clock I 've owned . It is especially nice during the fall and winter months when my wake time of 5:30 or 6am shows no sign of real sunlight - now I can fake it ! I 'm not a morning person , so the fact that this product makes mornings more tolerable and actually enjoyable means a lot ! This product had been on my wish list for about a year and I am so happy to finally own it ! 	Alarm Clock
I got this thinking a larger clock would be easier to see from part way across the room . I need to watch the second hand to time my stretching exercises . Unfortunately , I didnt look closely at the picture . the Silver Second hand is almost invisible unless I move the clock to right next to my face so I can see it . oh well . the clock works well so far , and I like the nice green color of the face at night . it 's very cheerful and good company . Just look closely . a red second hand is easier to see . That 's the alarm hand . 	Alarm Clock
I have mixed feelings about this alarm clock . It has some great features , but also some flaws . I gave it 3 stars mostly due to the poor quality of the antenna -LRB- a wire that you have to move around just right to hear the weather radio -RRB- . A sturdy metal antenna would have worked much better . My antenna arrived damaged . The warrenty is limited -- I sent it to the manufacturer and they charge you $ 5 to get it sent back to you , plus you have to pay to ship it out . So , it cost me about 1\/2 the original price just to get it working properly . Very disappointing , and due to poor quality of the antenna . <p> Other than that , the only significant flaw -LRB- that bothers me , that is -RRB- I see is how small the Sleep button is . It 's difficult to find in the dark , and it 's made flatter than the rest of the buttons -LRB- it 's on the top left of the front of the clock -RRB- . This makes it hard to press the button , too . <p> The alarm does have some very nice qualities . Being able to listen to the weather when the news on TV is n't on and it 's stormy -LRB- so ca n't turn on the computer -RRB- is very handy ! Make sure you have a NOAA weather station in your area before you buy , because the signals are weak and you may not be able to pick it up at all . <p> The slow-to-wake buzzer is really nice . It helps you wake easily , rather than jumping out of your skin . It starts to almost nothing to a fairly loud buzzer . You wo n't sleep through this buzzer . <p> Also handy is the Reset button . This resets your alarm for the next day . You do n't have to remember to turn the alarm on everyday , because it just resets it to the same time for the next day . <p> If you 're buying this for the Hi\/Lo dimmer , I would n't recommend this clock radio . It works , but it is n't very dim . I leave it on dim all the time because the Hi setting is so bright . 	Alarm Clock
Purchased this little clock for my son . I like it . The only thing that bothers me is that I can not find the adapter cord that suppose to go with it . So for now we use batteries and it will do for now . I love the fact that the numbers are large enough to see from across the room and it lights up . So now I 'm on a mission to find this adapter . Wish me luck . 	Alarm Clock
Who cares about what it looks like , the whole purpose of an alarm clock is to make sure you wake up on time . This alarm is n't loud enough for heavy sleepers like me . I tried using this a couple of times and both times I ended up not hearing it , overslept , and was late for my college class . Which , btw , seriously ticked me off . I bought it because another reviewer had said the alarm was loud ... sorry , but it 's not . It now sits unused in my desk drawer . Total waste of money . 	Alarm Clock
YOU CA N'T FIND MUCH BETTER THAN THIS CLOCK IF WANT A CLOCK YOU CAN SEE FROM ACROSS THE ROOM ... ... PRICE IS GREAT ALSO . . 	Alarm Clock
Best clock ever . We have 3 of them and they are fantastic both in the home and traveling . Definately recommend . 	Alarm Clock
I 've owned this clock for about three years now and I love it . I was actually looking for one for my boyfriend -LRB- who loves it too -RRB- when I came across all these negative reveiws . Now I am a light sleeper and even the quietest alarm would shock me awake . That is the main reason that I bought this clock in the first place . The radio broke within the first few months and I found the buzzer too loud for me so I was forced to leave it on the silent setting . I was really worried that this would not wake me up so I also chose to use the flash at wake up option . Even if I 've only had a couple of hours of sleep , the flashing light wakes me up everytime . Granted , I am a light sleeper so it does n't take much for me to get up , however my boyfriend has to set up what we call the `` alarm minefield '' to get up in the mornings and I was suprised that this clock wakes him up . I do have to agree that the display is quite bright , so I read the manual and you can dim the display by holding down the Demo and Snooze buttons at the same time . Overall , this has a great size that makes it easy to take with me when I travel -LRB- which I do quite often -RRB- . This clock has so many options that you can really fine tune it in order to find out what works best for you . I have recommended this clock to many people and they love theirs as well . 	Alarm Clock
This is a pretty clock , and I like the sweep second hand . It keeps accurate time . The price is right . One big problem - the alarm does n't work . It would be a better deal if it cost a dollar more and the alarm worked . 	Alarm Clock
this thing is LOUD , but has volume control . the vibrate feature shakes my children out of bed ! love it ! 	Alarm Clock
I ordered this clock in April . It stopped working correctly in July . I expected more . The clock face -LRB- actual time -RRB- became unreadable . The numbers dimmed to the point that they were unreadable . I tried to change the batteries but NO JOY . 	Alarm Clock
We purchased this alarm clock for our son 's birthday present . It worked well when we first got it and worked for the first few hours of him having it . The sound then stopped and eventually started working again but now on day 2 it has stopped making sound again . I will be trying to contact the company tomorrow to see if they have any helpful ideas on what to do . Hopefully I do n't have to spend a ton of money shipping and replacing a product that only worked one day . If the sound issue would not have happened I would have given this product a much higher rating , but cool or not , it is an alarm clock with no sound . 	Alarm Clock
Although this travel alarm may not be for everyone , it suits my needs perfectly . It 's display is large enough to read from a distance , it is easy to set and the alarm is loud enough to wake me . There is n't anything I would change about it . 	Alarm Clock
I love this thing . I keep it set on hourly chirping . I spend half the year in Seattle with only crows and seagulls . This clock reminds me so much of home in the Carolinas with the chirping of various birds and it is fun to guess . I put it on the deck with the raptor card hoping to scare away unwanted critters . . that has only frightened the cat , however . 	Alarm Clock
This little clock is great : it is very easy to use because it does n't have any excess settings . All of the buttons and settings you can see in the photo . It folds nicely into the base for easy travel . However , to see the time at night -LRB- light turns on by pressing the snooze button on the bottom right -RRB- , little lightbulbs next to the numbers come on . It 's not LED . And so , it means one must bring the clock closer to the face to see properly -LRB- especially when waking up -RRB- . 	Alarm Clock
Clock worked great for about 6 months then pretty much died . The LCD would flicker and switch between days rapidly -- as if it was n't `` set '' on the right day . $ 40 down the drain . Three years is about what I expect from this type of product , I got six months . Out of warranty : -LRB- Edit -LRB- 2-07 -RRB- : I decided to take the whole thing apart because I 'm curious about how things work and I thought , what the heck , maybe I 'll find something out of alignment . I saw how the knob thing-a-ma-jig works and I removed a plastic piece that covered an internal metal dial which changes the day of the week setting . While the thing was in 10 pieces on my desk I plugged it in and the problem seemed gone . Reassembled it -LRB- very easy -RRB- without putting the plastic protector piece back on . Seems to work good as new now . I do n't have enough of an ego to claim I `` fixed '' it . But whatever I did it works now . As it stands I 'd give it 4 out of 5 stars . One thing I did n't mention in my initial review is that I do n't care for the secondary dial that you use to change your alarm time . You have to rotate it to change the seconds or hours depending on how fast you rotate it . Sort of minor inconvenience . But assuming the clock stays fixed , I 'd recommend it . Hope this update helps . 	Alarm Clock
This clock does exactly what it 's advertised to do . It 's small , it 's cute , it works on a AA battery and the alarm is loud enough to wake up a normal person . I like the finish and the retro look . What I especially like is that is has a little button you push to see the face light up in the middle of the night ... without having it lit up all the time . It 's an awesome clock for $ 10 . I received exactly the clock that was represented . 	Alarm Clock
this is a fine alarm clock . it has funny nature sounds and alarms -LRB- my favorite is the babbling brook -RRB- . I think the intention is that you put on the nature sound before going to sleep and it will help you sleep . great idea if the ocean sound , for example , did n't remind me of flushing toilets . I mean the sounds are muffled , like they are inside a box . the nature sound loops are short -LRB- about ten seconds then it repeats not too noticeably -RRB- . the forest sound is mostly a bunch of crickets and the occasional hooting owl -LRB- if you into that sort of thing -RRB- . anyways , this is a fine alarm clock in an attractive green package , but if you want to sleep to the sounds of nature , but one of those CDs , or move to the country . 	Alarm Clock
This little travel alarm is just what I needed . Small , easy to see and use and the alarm is just right . Not too loud , plesant . Love it . 	Alarm Clock
This clock works for me because I have poor vision it is larger than most small portble alarms and it has black numbers on white . Because I 'm an insomniac I like a clock close to me by my pillow . I like the brightness of the face and the fact that it has a good light by tapping on top . However if you want a clock that keeps good time this is not it . It loses about 5 minutes during the day average and 10 at night , probably because I tap the light at least once . The exact time does n't matter that much to me in those circumstances because its easy to just turn the time knob in back and reset it . 	Alarm Clock
My son absolutley loves his new alarm clock and loves to pose it . It is a nice size and fits well beside the bed . I would agree with others though that it would be nice to have light up numbers so you can see it easily at night . and for whatever reason I was hoping the alarm would be something a little unique like a Darth Vader voice telling you to wake up . Oh well ... If you have any Star Wars fans in the family they would really like this . The Delivery was quick also 	Alarm Clock
Bought this product because it shows 2 different time zones so you can set it such that it shows the time where you are and where you 're loved one is when you are traveling or living in other parts of the world . Have n't used it as an alarm yet . It 's small and does n't weigh much and easy to put on your nightstand for example . 	Alarm Clock
I could n't imagine waking up to anything else . Sooooo pleasant , and I am NOT a morning person ! 	Alarm Clock
I purchased this clock after reading so many great reviews . After unpacking the clock I was horrified to see 10 o'clock at the top of the dial where 12 o'clock should be . Horrible , cheap , junk . Do not buy . 	Alarm Clock
This clock looks great but functionally it is terrible . An alarm clocks main purpose is to wake you up . This clock has a quiet alarm that is on for 30 seconds and then the alarm turns off automatically never to sound again for that day . I purchased this for the time zone feature but the alarm is so poor I can not use it . It was wasted money . 	Alarm Clock
Excellent product . Works just like advertised . No problems purchasing and receiving this item . 	Alarm Clock
Simple and easy to use : one switch and two buttons . Good value for the money . One-way set -LRB- advance only -RRB- for hours and minutes -LRB- one button for each -RRB- , so if you overshoot your mark , you have to go around again , but it 's fast . The stand is a bit fragile , but serviceable . One unexpected feature - you can use the night light to drive with if your headlights go out . 	Alarm Clock
I have had this alarm clock for over two years and it has never let me down the variable snooze length is awesome I set it for 5 minutes and if I want to snooze 20 minutes I hit it 4 times if I need another 5 hit it again when it goes off for another 5 . Nap feature is awesome if you want to set a quick timer . Never have to turn the alarm off or forget to turn it off on the weekends just set the alarms for Mon-Fri and let it run ... The sound quality of the radio surpasses what I would expect from a clock radio even though I seldom listen to it . A great all around alarm clock with lots of features . There are a few features that were added to the executive that i think would be nice to have but this does everything that i need and more . Would definitely buy again and again ... 	Alarm Clock
I bought this quiet , talented little clock for myself after searching for the perfect alarm clock ... this was it . . and then my husband insisted I get him one for traveling ... 	Alarm Clock
We love the look of this clock , but it will simply stop running without warning . Not slowly loose time . Stop . Got it 3 weeks ago and have put at least 4 different batteries in it thinking they were dead . Batteries are all fine . They power other items . Something is wrong inside . Battery fits tight so it must be beyond where the battery goes . 	Alarm Clock
The Soleil Sun alarm clock does work . The light does turn on slowly , simulating a sunrise , and that does help me wake up . However , the quality of this piece is so disappointing , and I do feel taken advantage of , because of the price . The radio in this unit is the cheapest they could get away with . The sound quality is poor , not even in stereo . The body is cheap plastic , and mine even had a blemish on the surface . The controls are small and require patience to manipulate . And the light itself does not get all that bright . Once the irritating-scratchy-mono-poorly-tuned radio wakes me up , I also have to turn on another light in my room to really stay awake . I got this unit because it was the least expensive one I could find . It does help help me to wake up because of the light , but I still feel bitter that I had to pay that big of a price for such a poor quality unit . It 's as if the Soleil Sun company is sitting in their offices saying to themselves , `` Eat my shorts ! We know there 's nothing out there that 's cheaper , so nyah-nyah ! '' 	Alarm Clock
I think its a good travel clock and certainly easy to set , etc. . However , it is impossible to read the time in the dark and that would be the only improvement needed to give it 5 stars . So far , I 've taken it on two trips and it performs just fine . 	Alarm Clock
I have always had problems waking up to alarm clocks ... I 'm an extremely deep sleeper . I use my IPhone , iPad , I pod , cell phone , and two other alarm clocks . This is an outstanding product ! It wakes me up just like I was hoping it would . It is extremely loud and even has a vibrating attachment . Fair warning : I would not recommend putting it under your pillow like some people do because it gets very hot . I put the vibration attaachmen on the nightstand and it works remarkably . It makes an even louder noise . FINALLY SOMETHING THAT WORKS ! 	Alarm Clock
This little alarm clock is OK but there are 2 main flaws with it . First and foremost I sleep deeply and snooze a lot before finally waking . This clock only allows 4 snoozes , 4 minutes apart , before the alarm just stops going off . Also , when you have a travel alarm clock with a fold over cover like this please put a gap and a slight hole so the snooze button can be hit immediately without opening the cover . My girlfriend has an alarm clock almost identical to this from Timex that has long since been discontinued and it handles all these feature perfectly . You 'd think something so simple would be easy to find . Hopefully they improve this one someday . In all other ways the clock was great . 	Alarm Clock
The box for my La Crosse Atomic Alarm Clock states the Model No. is WT-6165U-SPB , but the clock itself states that the Model No. is WT-2165LED . I have no idea what `` U-SPB '' is supposed to mean . Amazon has several La Crosse travel clocks listed on its web site which appear similar to this clock and each has a different model number , but all appear to have similar features . Like many electronic devices on the market today , this clock was made in China . The label inside the door of the battery compartment states that it takes a `` AA '' battery , but it actually takes a AAA battery . The battery was not included in the box . After installing a battery , the clock automatically picked up the correct time from the atomic clock after sitting out overnight . However , the clock must be set manually for the correct time zone - it does not have a GPS in it , so it has to be told where it is by selecting the correct time zone . Setting everything else on this clock must also be done manually and is not very intuitive . Fortunately , directions are printed on the bottom of the base , as well as in an instruction manual included in the box . Unfortunately , setting the numbers on the display can be tricky , because the numbers move in only one direction - up . If you miss the number you want , you then have to move through the entire cycle and hope you can hit the correct number the next time around . It would have been helpful if there were a reverse button , but there is not . There is a LED light on the inside right side of the display which makes the time and other items displayed readable in the dark . The display can be illuminated by gently pushing the top of the clock back on the base . The same motion also activates the snooze feature . The display is also illuminated when the alarm goes off , so you immediately know the time even if the room is dark . The snooze length is adjustable from 0 -LRB- for no snooze at all -RRB- to 59 minutes . The clock also has two alarms and each has a distinctive ring . These are all convenient features . The alarm can be deactivated by pushing any of the four buttons on the back , but doing so resets the alarm for the same time the next day . To completely deactivate the alarm , the button for the actual alarm has to be pushed . I found that it is very easy to accidentally activate the alarm because only a brief push on the alarm button activates it . Also , when the base is flipped to the `` closed '' position , it covers only the display on the front of the clock - the buttons on the back are exposed and the alarm can be accidentally activated if pressure is place on either of the two alarm buttons . Therefore , when traveling , I check the clock after unpacking to make sure the alarm was not accidentally turned on by pressure from other items in my luggage . It would have been helpful if there were a way to deactivate the alarm buttons when traveling , but this is another feature that is lacking on this clock . This is a decent alarm clock , but there is room for considerable improvement . 	Alarm Clock
The clock is small , sleek and made by a reputable company . The only disappointment is the backlighting to view the clock in the dark . It is so dim you can barely read the time . From all of the other reviews I read before purchase , everyone seemed to have a favorable opinion of its funtion and long-lasting battery . I hope that is true as I have not used it yet .

I bought two of these to replace our two Timex bedside clock radios . Whenever there was a power failure , the time would drift on the backup batteries so eventually they displayed different and incorrect times . They also had to be adjusted twice a year between Daylight Saving Time and Standard Time . We grew tired of this . I searched far and wide for a radio-controlled alarm clock with an amber LED back-lit display that stays illuminated all of the time . I was unable to find any . This clock is close . It has an amber LED back-lit display that illuminates for a few seconds when the snooze bar is pressed . The alarm is fairly loud and progressively beeps more the longer it alarms , a good feature . However , if the snooze bar is not pressed , the alarm stops and does not beep again for another 24 hours . The best part , though , is that the clock never has to be set , is always correct , and automatically changes between Standard and Daylight Saving Time . 	Alarm Clock
Let 's just start out this review saying that I am a geek . That being said , i LOVE this clock . I mean , its darth vader , and he tells time ! what it is not to love ! It seems well made , but out of plastic , all the arms and legs move , and you can rearrange darth to how you like . To see the time clearly , you have to push on darth vaders head , and the screen lights up red . If you do n't push on his head , the time can be a bit hard to see . But besides that , i lovelovelove my darth vader clock . Beware , other nerdy friends may try to steal your darth vader clock . you have been warned . 	Alarm Clock
the clock is so cheap and very useful and reliable . the back lit is really helpful at night . the thermometer come it handy to temperature control . 	Alarm Clock
My daughter has n't been late for school since I bought this as a second alarm clock ! Her `` regular '' one is set ; this one is set for ten minutes later and sits at the foot of her stairs . If she gets up on time she never has to hear this one ! -LRB- The variable tone and volume is a real plus too -RRB- 	Alarm Clock
The light on this dawn simulator is pretty feeble . It works for me because I 'm fairly light sensitive , but it certainly does n't feel like dawn when it comes on . Also , the radio quality is terrible . I get major static on all but a couple of stations , ones I do n't want to listen to . If I had it to do over , I 'd buy a different one . 	Alarm Clock
I needed a portable battery powered alarm clock that has an illuminated dial . Chosing this clock was a big mistake . It 's time can only be illuminated by pressing one of several confusing un-labeled buttons TWICE , so you ca n't just see the time in a dark room . The alarm mechanism has mal-functioned on several occasions , usually at the worst time . The `` nature sounds '' are actually cheap sounding and annoying . The badly translated directions are worthless . This is the perfect gift for someone you detest . 	Alarm Clock
Love the features of this clock ! I travel a lot on pet-sitting jobs staying in others ' houses , & have learned the hard way to bring my own clock . I have to have one that is absolutely silent and that I could easily see at night . This fits the bill with it 's sweep second hand & it 's adjustable brightness back-light via a turning wheel on the back . My only problem was the stupid design of the ` cut-out ' hour & minute hands . Unless I had the adjustable back-light on full brightness , -LRB- a little too bright for me to sleep -RRB- I could barely make out the hands since there was n't enough contrast . -LRB- I have near perfect vision , and do n't need to use glasses\/contacts , so that was n't a factor -RRB- . I thought about having a jeweler replace the hands , but I ended up fixing it myself . I took off the plastic face plate and , using some black electrical tape cut to size , put the tape pieces over the hands . Tweezers came in very handy doing this -LRB- & a steady hand -RRB- , but it was n't too hard . I just had to make sure I got the placement right the first time , since trying to rip the tape back off could damage the hands . Now it is perfect for me . I would have given this clock a 5-star had I not needed to work on it . FYI It runs on 3 AA batteries , keeps accurate time , is 41\/2 '' tall . If Elgin ever makes a smaller ` travel size ' one , I would get that too ! 	Alarm Clock
No nature sounds , no satellite settings , no iPod or CD connections , just a straight forward alarm clock that 's refreshing in its simplicity . Pull it out of the package -LRB- it already has the battery -RRB- , set the time , the time you want to get up , switch on the alarm and be done with it . Some things do n't need to be complicated -LRB- such as an alarm clock -RRB- . I have it on my night stand and when I travel , I throw it in the suitcase , sandwiched between a stack of clothes . Its sturdy enough -LRB- plastic -RRB- to get the job done . 	Alarm Clock
The Westclox 1950 Moon Beam Big Ben provides the gentle awakening by flashing its light yet the bell which follows is classic . It lacks the harsh electronic buzz of past bedside invaders in our household . Another lovely aspect of this clock lies in the back-up battery which allows it to not lose a moment . I 'm sure that was n't part of the original 1950 's design but is welcome now . Our clock is a vanilla color which goes with just about any decor . Try this gentle journey . Your children and grandchildren will also enjoy this lovely alternative to being blown out of bed by raucous buzzing or music . 	Alarm Clock
This clock has several nice features including a variable back-lighting feature . The brightness of the back-light is controlled by a dial located on the rear of the clock . One drawback is the Alarm On\/Off switch . It is not easy to locate early in the morning . The switch is recessed into the right side of the clock and is a slide type , not a toggle switch . The product write-up says it uses a ` C ' battery however the one I received from Amazon uses two ` AA ' batteries -LRB- also not included -RRB- . It may be a little too large to serve as a convenient travel alarm clock . 	Alarm Clock
Item replaced the clock that my father had since the 50 's . Terrific item ' 	Alarm Clock
Somehow this clock has a different rate than the expected 1h per hour . It runs almost 50 % as fast , what makes it useless . It would be interesting to see how frequent this problem is . Anyone else ? 	Alarm Clock
Takes way too long to eve start delivery . It 's 4 days & I an still recieving the same lame message `` shipping soon '' . Stop talking and do it !!! If you want your item do n't shop at amazon ! 	Alarm Clock
Bought this for keepsake and they are very nice indeed . I paid more for the Darth Vader from Toys R Us -LRB- do n't ask me why -RRB- and on hindsight , I guessed I should have checked Amazon before making any purchase in future . This is very nice and definitely a must keep for star wars fan . I am waiting for Amazon to stock up again as the others are selling it too expensive now that Lego is out of stock too . 	Alarm Clock
I have been searching for an affordable sunrise simulator for some time now , and still have not found one that is worth the money . The Soleil Sun Alarm clock is cheaply made but comes with a large price tag . It is small in size , which makes it great for placing it on a small nightstand , but it had to be positioned just so in order to read the display -LRB- the instructions recommended `` eye level '' , but that was n't necessarily the case -RRB- . The display was not illuminated , so it was unreadable unless you pressed a button to activate the backlight . The nature sounds had an annoying hum accompanying the sound regardless of the volume . The LED light was a great addition , but was not replaceable which was a problem . The light itself was not bright enough to use as a reading light , which was one of the features listed in the product description . I would not recommend this product . 	Alarm Clock
"The design of the display is great , I like how you can go both back and forth through the sounds , without having to cycle through them all , and it comes with a lot of sounds -LRB- though some I ca n't see anyone wanting to sleep to -RRB- . The date and time are easy to set . I did n't use the alarm functions , as I prefer to use my cell phones alarm , so I ca n't speak to the functionality of that . Some other reviews have made comments about the shortness of the tracks before repeating , but it 's not something I noticed too much . I ended up returning it after two days . The biggest problem for me was this low humming that emanated from it through any sound , and I found it really distracting , because I was listening to the buzzing hum more than the sound -LRB- Ebb Tide -RRB- . I looked up some reviews , and found other people with the same issue , which apparently turns out to be a cheap power supply causing the speakers to vibrate inappropriately -LRB- or something , I do n't exactly understand the concept -RRB- . Learning that , I realized it was a design flaw , and not my unit , so I dropped the idea of just exchanging it . The other problem I had with it , though by itself it was n't enough to make me want to return it , is the lack of real volume control . You have loud , louder , loudest , blow your ear drums , and 11 . The lowest setting -LRB- 1 -RRB- was barely tolerable for me on most sounds , and utterly unacceptable on others . Had I decided to keep it , I 'd have relocated it to the other end of the room . I ended up replacing it with <ahref=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002WGHKQW/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/178-9798861-6265026""> Sound Oasis S-650-01 Sleep Sound Therapy System </a> . I only just got it today , so I have no review of it yet , but I can tell you there is no annoying audio buzz . Also , some stores will price match with Amazon if you print out the page , so I actually got it for less than the Amazon price . "	Alarm Clock
I read the reviews about this product before buying and almost did n't buy it . The illumination is definately not to bright . The highest setting is bright for those who want it that way but the lowest is sufficiently low . The range of sounds are great . I have a cpap and now that is n't the sound I have to hear trying to get to sleep . Long story short , I do n't usually write reviews but this machine is excellent . 	Alarm Clock
I purchased the Sharper Image Sound Soother EC-B100 to drown out background noise and to help with the ringing in my ears . Prior to that I had been using a small room sized air purifier to do the job . Oh , the purifier still works it 's I figured a sound machine would do a better job . Now this sound machine has a lot of great features , sleep to sound or run for as long as you choose . You can wake to a selected sound or the beep beep of a alarm . The selection of sounds is great , however , I liked the Rain and the White Noise sounds . Problem with mine was the volume . If I turned the volume on level `` 1 '' , it was way too quiet and hardly audible . If my wife was watching TV in the other room I could easily hear it . Nor did it mask out the ringing in my ears . It did not mask the TV out nor any other background noise . But if I turned the volume to the next setting , `` 2 '' it was way too loud . I could hear it in the other room and was not able to sleep by it . It was like going from Level 1 to Level 5 with no in between . Sadly I had no choice but to return it and I 'll just use my purifier or a floor fan in the summer . 	Alarm Clock
I got this alarm clock for my son 's 5th birthday since he will be starting Kindergarten in the fall . The clock is very user friendly for a young child and it 's durable . There are basic buttons labeled on the back ... time , hour , minute , and a switch to turn the alarm on . I did n't realize when I purchased it that it only beeps but that 's okay . My son likes the idea of having an alarm clock , as it gives him a sense of responsibility and being a big boy . You can either stand Woody up or sit him down . It 's very cute ! I 'd buy it again .

This was my daughter 's favorite clock . She took it everywhere but somehow forgot to take it when she went off to school . So , I `` borrowed '' it . It is at least 5 years old now and the projection display is going out . It has been wonderful for all these years tho . The battery is a great back up for when the power goes out . The only thing I did n't care for is that the projector display is upside down when you are lying in bed and there is no way that I can see to flip it . 	Alarm Clock
This alarm clock is easy to use and set up . It has a large time read out . The biggest draw back is the soft alarm . It need needs to be much louder . 	Alarm Clock
I spent several years , off and on , traveling independently in Asia , Australia and the Pacific Rim , for months at a time . My constant companion in these travels was this clock . Every other travel clock I looked at was too big . This one is smaller than a credit card -LRB- maybe half as tall -RRB- . It also has a built-in stand that folds away so you can stow the clock in your pocket -LRB- i.e. , it becomes a pocket watch of sorts -RRB- ; as well as an illumination button for use in the dark , and an alarm that 's loud enough to ensure you wo n't sleep through it -- no matter how tired you might be . This is a simple item , with a few well-marked buttons and thoughtful design , powered by two common button-cell batteries . It 's also robust ; I was still using mine well after the labels had worn off . One day , about six years after I bought it , I heard something clunking in the dryer . When I looked inside I found that I 'd left the clock in a pants pocket , where it had been washed and dried . The crazy thing is , it was still keeping time ! Who needs Rolex , right ? I 'd pay about $ 25 for one of these . The fact they 're under twelve bucks is just icing on the cake . I doubt Casio still makes them , though , so buy while you can . 	Alarm Clock
Hate that infuriating buzz-buzz sound from your alarm clock ? Nature sounds are a great solution , but you wo n't get them from this alarm clock . This alarm 's `` nature sounds '' are actually closer to white noise and they 're just about the only sound more unpleasant than the typical buzzing alarm clock . Fortunately , the standard buzzing is still an option on this alarm . <p> Sounds aside , the clock does n't disappoint . The buttons to adjust alarm and time are found on the back of the unit , far away from the oversized snooze button on top . There 's no danger of resetting the time as you sleepily grope for the snooze button . <p> One last warning : the clock is a little smaller than I expected from the image . If you 're near-sighted , considering getting a clock with extra-large digits . 	Alarm Clock
I had an old Aiwa 3 CD stereo , but by today 's standards , it is BIG ! So ... I hooked this amp up to my old aiwa speakers and it sounded great ! The only thing -LRB- there is always a thing -RRB- , the wall wart -LRB- power adapter -RRB- that came with it was for a Vonage phone system and it died within 2 days . Luckily , I found a 12 volt DC adapter and this amp keeps on `` chuggin '' . 	Amplifier
I found the power adapter in pictures , but I did ' t find this in package . I 'm very disappointed on this , I have to buy one for this amplifier 	Amplifier
I used this together with the RCA antenna and the reception is awesome . The preamplifier boosted the signal and allowed me to get in 8 more T.V. stations than without it . 	Amplifier
Received quickly , I read the reviews on this product and was hoping it to be close . Wow , This product was quick to install and works great . Great sound great price great product . Thanks 	Amplifier

have it hooked to two 15 inch alpine type r subs and gives the power needed for those subs it is a really good amp and at a great price 	Amplifier
This amp is amazing ! I hear noise when no music is playing -LRB- sounds to me like hissing -RRB- but from what I read about hissing this is not it . For example , if I turn the volume up on my Alpine Type-R speakers I hear -LRB- hisssssssssssss -RRB- . However , when music starts playing you ca n't hear it over the music . I was told this is what amplifiers do . I also turned up my Yahmaha surround sound that 's connected to my PS3 and the speakers were doing the same thing . So , I think you are supposed to hear it , but I 'm not 100 % sure . If someone would like to give me some advice on this I would appreciate it . I 'm using Pioneer AVH 3400BT head-unit , this amp , and two sets of Alpine Type-R component speakers . 	Amplifier
I bought this amp and all I can say is . . it hits and for the price extremely happy very easy to tune and it never over heats or gets hot it may get a little bit warm but other then that very good amp ! 	Amplifier
The wire inside the thick insulation is maybe 10 or 12 gauge . The outer diameter is the same as a normal 8 gauge car audio power wire , however it 's mostly insulation . Very poor quality wire . Look elsewhere . 	Amplifier
It works great for what it is and for the price . Dont expect it to put out a lot all the time . The RMS specs are 75 watts per channel I believe . Check their website . 	Amplifier
Works as advertised . I missed the part about the 9 volt battery and had to go one of those without robbing a smoke detector . I never dreamed I would ever buy one of these again but in my old age I have an old turntable with a magnetic cartidge and no receiver with a preamp circuit built in . Now I can play my Christmas Records again . 	Amplifier

Web site descriptions claim item works with most home phones . NOT true . Once you receive item and read instructions , you find out that the item will not work with phones where the keypad is in the handset . This is most phones now a days . So it does n't work , and vendors want 20 % restock fee and tracked shipping . You end up losing half the purchase price just to return it . 	Amplifier
Amazing ! So easy to hook up . I bought it for my cable internet but , low and behold my TV 's all got better too . I might need to get another one . 	Amplifier
With Vista ultimate I connected the cable to a 2 way splitter to the modem and to the media card . The modem signal began to be troublesome . I attached the booster at the house entry as directed and it did the trick . I have three TVs , cable phone , and the computer and all worked well . I now enjoy tv at the computer . 	Amplifier
Excellent for the money . Wanted to improve clarity and volume a bit more than what a DSX 210 Sony headunit . Does exactly that and is quite clear for this price level . 	Amplifier
I bought this amp a little skeptical about the amp due to the bad reviews and everyone saying its pyle is not good . but i say dont believe them ive had it for a month hooked up to two pioneeres 12 inch subs 1300 watts a piece i got the amp a full the beat hard and they sound great . this is a great amp !

I purchased this product and while it did work as advertised it failed approximately 60 days after installation . In full disclosure it failed during the peak of the 100 + degree weather we were having and I had installed it in our homes attic . Therfore I could credit the failure to the extreme heat given it was probably over 140 degrees in our attic . Given that I would not recommend this product for installation in an attic enviroment . I believe it would last much longer where excessive heat is not a factor . 	Amplifier
Got this to replace the Pyle amp that died after a couple of days . I only use it to power two small speakers in the back yard as part of a remote system hooked up to an old HK receiver . It is clearly capable of much grander status but I could n't found a cheaper one that I felt would last . In my experience the well-made Jap amps last twnty years plus and are usually bullet-proof to screw-ups in our power supply or speaker short outs . 	Amplifier
I had purchased one of these amplifiers to use with my indoor antenna for use with digital TV , and the thing did n't seem to amplify . As a matter of fact , no signal seemed to be presented at the output of the amplifier . I brought the amplifier to work and tested it with our equipment , and found the unit to be defective . I filled out the appropriate web form at Amazon , and they provided me with an amp the next day ! The new amp works flawlessly with my simple UHF loop antenna . I 'm about 9 miles from the city of Chicago , and I have no problems receiving all the local channels with an indoor antenna thanks to my Motorola amplifier . I 'd highly recommend this product .

I have had two of this amps , pyramid has been making this particular model for over 15 years . I used this power small devices such as phones and portable radios and TV . Its simple and sounds good . When I was in High school many years ago I used one of this to power my tape player Walkman in in my car , and to everyone surprise it sounded surprisingly good . Do n't expect to much from this product , it 's not going to make a 5 or 4 star review in an audio magazine . But if you are trying to do a inexpensive amplification , it does the job very well . It sounds good and has good adjustments . It is well worth the money . 	Amplifier
I bought this amp thinking it would push my 2 12 '' kickers . I turned it on and its sounds just amazing . it is an awesome amp for the cheap price 	Amplifier
What you see is what you get . I use it to split and pre-amp the signal from an MP3 player to a couple of sound systems . The sound quality is mostly noise free though I might think twice before using it in an important recording application . It has really good build quality and does a great job for the price . 	Amplifier
I 'm giving this 3 stars because it did exactly what it 's supposed to . The build quality is n't great , and the instructions are n't terribly clear in any of the 10 languages provided , but I was able to muddle through with other comments here and it worked just fine . And ... I could n't tell much of a different in the sound quality , either with Bose -LRB- yes , I know -RRB- earbuds or my Sennheiser HD202 's . The middle EQ or no EQ settings are best , but I could n't tell the difference between the headphone amp eq and tweaking the source eq . I think you have to know your ears for this kind of thing . If you rip everything to flac and 256bit mp3 's are like fingernails on a blackboard to you , you would probably get something out of this . My ears just ca n't tell a difference , so I returned it . 	Amplifier
For several years I have connected TV 's in 4 different rooms to 1 Direct TV DVR receiver . Picture quality has always been fair , and a little snowy . I have recently added a 5th TV and also placed the Motorola Signal Booster at the output to the receiver . Picture quality at all 5 TV 's is exceptional , and the previously mentioned snow is gone . GREAT PRODUCT !!! 	Amplifier
this amp is amazing it has all the power you would need to run just about any sub ive had it hooked up to three subs at a time and it had absolutely no problem running them . 	Amplifier
I got this to power some Infinity Reference door speakers . I initially hooked it up using the high level inputs with one channel on the front speakers and the other to power my 8 '' Infinity Sub . There was alternator whine , crazy pops and crackles . I then got a speaker to RCA convertor and tried that . It all worked with no whine , but the sound coming from the amp was very weak to the sub . I tried different patch cords as well . Did n't seem to make a difference . I could not have the alternator whine or the cracks and pops - so I kept with the RCAs and ended up using my 2 channel amp for the sub , like I used to have it set up . Just mentioning this because the high level inputs were not good for me . The high level input wires for the Legacy amp were something line 30 gauge - very tiny . Aside from that , the amp works great . Easy to adjust and just as advertised . 	Amplifier
This amp had done a very nice job powering my 2 12 '' Jl W3 subs . T \ I have the gains set to about half of its potential and the subs pound . They might not hate some notes that a more expensive amp will hit but they definitly are similar in loudness . The main downside to this amp is the overheating . After I play about three songs in my car , the amp will be very hot and I will need to give it a break because i dont wanna blow it . I know amps can handle alot of heat , but you need to be careful and check your amp very often . 	Amplifier
I spent another 3 hours at Best Buy while they diagnosed the problem was that the RCA cables in this kit stopped working . They were not crimped , split , etc. . . they showed me , they stopped working in two weeks and put my amp into safe mode . I 'm glad they did n't charge me anything except for the cables I bought from them . My stereo actually sounds better with their cables . I did n't think high dollar cables would make that big of difference in sound , but in this case they did . Not to mention the hassle of having to sit there for that long to figure out the cables were the problem ... ... . 	Amplifier
alright I just got done reading the reviews for this product so far I have bought two of these pyramid 1,000 watt amps and I plain on buying 6 more I am no expert but I do know how to correctly install amps and sound systems I have measured the out put for the amp it is a true 1,000 watt amp I have stressed the amp out go the point of having a 1.23 ohm load on it never had any overheating problems I read that one comment on this product saying that they needed bigger wires for the supply I currently have a 5 gauge supply line to my amps I currently have four 12 inch subs connected to two of these amps this is well worth the price when u know what you are doing and how to connect it correctly 	Amplifier

After seeing & hearing how well this product worked , I 've bought 3 more pairs . A set for each of my trucks to obtain an Ipod connection without replacing the aftermarket headunits to newer ones . Simple & easy solution for under $ 8 bucks versus a couple hundred bucks for each headunit . The first set I purchased solved the problem of not having an Ipod connection on the home theater system . Once again $ 8 fix versus several hundred + for a new amp\/receiver . This worked so well , I picked up another pair for the garage stereo which is an old bulletproof Sony I 've owned new since ' 88 . So , all told for under $ 40 bucks total I now the ability to play an Ipod virtually anywhere I travel . Be it in the living room , working in the garage , or heading down the highway the Ipod never gets to rest . Also , the length is perfect . Easily allows enough extension from the back of the headunit to within easy reach of the drivers seat . 	Amplifier
Product was exactly as described ! It was received on time ! No complaints and will do business again anytime , THANKS !!!! Will recommend to anyone . Great Transaction and fast procedure . 	Amplifier
I was disappointed to find that this kit has only a 3 foot ground cable . The product description is a little confusing because of the way the lines are split across bullet points ... I thought it meant that the fuse holder had 3 ft wires : \* 20 Ft. 8 ga red power cable Competition high-quality fuse folder 3 Ft \* 8 ga. black ground cable 16 Ft. 18 ga blue turn-on wire 20 Ft Fortunately , I had some 8 gauge black wire already so I used that - I never use the chassis ground for high current devices , it 's better to run both ground and power back to the battery . The wire does n't seem to be the same size as my existing 8 gauge cable , but it seems thicker than a 10 gauge , but I just `` eyeballed it '' , I did n't make any true measurements . The insulation on the wires is thicker than `` normal '' wires so if you 're trying to pull the wire through a small hole , that could cause a problem . 	Amplifier
Really helped on the picture quality . Unfortunately , it only lasted six months . Called motorola and they are very nice and efficient . They would honor the warranty but it would not be worth it in time and money to do it so I am buying a new one from someone else . 	Amplifier
It improves signal strength drastically with a regular indoor antenna . It actually works better than my amplified indoor antenna . 	Amplifier
For less than $ 90 and free shipping , this is a bargain . Just know there is no remote control , and the two inputs are not switch selectable , but automatically switch to input one if a signal is present . This switching seems a bit erratic and switches to the second input if there is even slight silence on the first input . This has caused mine to switch back and forth between sources unexpectedly -LRB- too fast a time constant I 'd guess -RRB- , so I 'm only using one input . If you can live with one input , this is a steal . 	Amplifier
Really happy with it ! The first one came with a little defect and the customer service in matter of minutes helped me ship and receive the new one . Since , I did n't have any issues and enjoyed the music . Thanks 	Amplifier
Initially , I had a low expectation on this item since I was using Radioshack cable signal booster without any much improvement . Glad , I was wrong ! Installation is very easy : Main source -- -RRB- 2-1 switch -LRB- to cable modem & Motorola signal booster -RRB- -- -RRB- Motorola -- -RRB- 2-1 switch -LRB- to farthest HDTV & 5-1 switch -RRB- . After connecting this item , all of my six HDTVs are displaying a superb picture quality , and cable internet connection is so fast . Amazing product , and highly recommended ! 	Amplifier
was looking for a product like this and finally ran into this one . Works great , am able to pick up tv signals that I was n't able to pick up before . I can actually enjoy my tv viewing again . 	Amplifier
I found that while my Grado SR-80i headphones sound great when plugged into an amp at home , there was a lack of clarity on the go . Even with the EQ options on the android app I use , my cell phone simply could not deliver the kind of signal to really drive these headphones , leaving some songs sounding muffled . In comes the Fiio E6 , and this tiny wonder restored punchy and responsive bass to my tunes . It no longer feels like my headphones are being starved ! As for battery life , I have no idea because I just got the E6 , but the improvement in sound is quite noticeable when using headphones that require some extra power . One downside is that the pre-programmed EQs in the E6 can not compare to a proper , multi-frequency , equalizer ... If you 're picky about your levels , do not expect much in that respect . I wish it were possible to program the E6 's EQ settings via a usb connection to my computer . With the stock settings , you 're much better off seeking a software solution on your portable music player instead . If you 're using an android device , I highly recommend PowerAMP which features a full-range graphic equalizer that beats every other music app out there . -LRB- EDIT -RRB- 2 months later : The battery life is reliable . I 've let it run nonstop with volume on full blast , and a full charge will last for over 24 hours . Listening a few hours a day , I charge it maybe once every 5 days . Changed from 4 to 5 , even if the EQ presets are lame . 	Amplifier
This is a great hifi unit . The sound is excellent , the delivery is tight and controlled , and you can crank it up with no worries . The toroidal transformer is a great plus . I really like the size and the look and feel of the unit . The front panel looks great -LRB- I have the black version -RRB- . It does n't run very warm . The remote is solid and feels good in your hands . There 's a `` tone defeat '' button , to bypass the bass\/treble . There 's plenty of inputs -LRB- including a jack on the front panel -RRB- . There are a few small annoyances . The biggest one is that it does n't have a standby mode , or an on\/off switch on the remote , so you have to switch it off on the amplifier itself . It 's also lacking a phono-in and a pre-out -LRB- but both are rare at this price point -RRB- . But other than that , it 's a solid little amplifier : paired with a good pair of bookshelf speakers , this is a great combo . Other unit considered : NAD C316BEE . 	Amplifier
I just got this product like a month ago and it is already having a minor tear at one of the ends ... I wish I did n't have to buy another monster product . . they do n't seem that durable for gym use . 	Amplifier
I used this amplifier with 6x9 to make a loud I home for my iPod haha ! Let me tell you even though it is 40 watts RMS bridged it still gets loud enough to hear it outside . I can only turn it up about half way with my iPod on full volume , if I go any higher it will just gets distorted but that is because of the speaker . The amp is flawless . Great build quality , durable , and very economical . I would recommend it to anyone ! 	Amplifier
I have this Amp Planet Audio 1800.5 and am pleasantly surprised . I have this in a Kia Spectra 5 hatchback . Head unit Kenwood - DDX418 . Front component speakers Kenwood KFC-P709PS , rear coaxial speakers KFC-X173 , 2 10 '' Kenwood KFC-W2513PS Performance Series 10 '' 1000W Subwoofer ... This is bridged . This system budgeted for $ 1000 or less and kicks serious azz . Do n't believe the hype and try this for yourself , you will be glad you did and you can spend the extra money to upgrade your head unit . 	Amplifier
I 've always struggled with low signal levels on my SB6120 cable modem and do n't get much love from my local cable company . I tried an old Motorola BDA100 -LRB- non active return -RRB- signal booster and it did n't work very well with bad\/high dBmV return signal levels on my SB6120 cable modem . I posted my dilemma on DSLreports forums and someone mentioned Active Return boosters . I did n't even know they existed , ordered one ASAP and now I have a perfect 36 dBmV upstream and 0 dBmV downstream , with very low `` Total Correctable Codewords '' . The tiling on my HDTV local channels is GONE !!! The best $ 40 I 've spent in a long time . 	Amplifier
I use this amp to feed speakers on my roof deck from internet music -LRB- various sources -RRB- . My computer sound card software has more than enough adjustments to trim the audio so no `` preamp '' is required . I like that it is reasonably small and that it will turn off after 20 minutes or so in the absence of a signal . The sound is clean and there is plenty of power for my application . A good deal ! 	Amplifier
I have had no problems with this amp so far , Build quality seems good , especially for it 's low , low price . I wish I had bought several more of them since it seems they are now unavailable . If I see them for sale again I will buy more for sure ! 	Amplifier

Great product and price . Turned out to be to strong for my area . Sorry I had to return it . Loved it . 	Amplifier
I read the reviews on this before I bought it and I have to say most all of the reviews here are spot on . I 'm not car install expert I 've done enough installs to know a thing or two . As far as the reviews on here go about the wire gauge not being 4 gauge wire - absolutely true . It has enough insulation on it to carry 220 volts if you ask me . Be forewarned - the speaker wire is very thin guage -LRB- I think 16 when I stripped it -RRB- so if you want to power a big speaker -LRB- s -RRB- with a big amp -LRB- s -RRB- , please do yourself a favor and go get your wire from a place that sells car audio items . Other than this , the the wires are plentiful in length and while they are CCA -LRB- copper clad aluminum -RRB- they serve their purpose . Put it to you this way . If you 're pushing 500 watts or less , this kit is more than enough . No , it 's not a competition kit by any means , but none of the stuff has overheated , nor has it given me any problems . It 's a definite good buy if you want an above average wiring kit , for an average price . If you 're installing something major though - I would look elsewhere . 	Amplifier
This headphone amplifier does not amplify as well as I thought it would . It is definitely not for an audiophile . The product did amplify my music but raised the decibel level by only 3 decibels -LRB- twice as loud -RRB- . I was expecting much more . 	Amplifier
For the price , you can not beat this amp . It takes the remarkably muddy sound out of my MacBook Pro and makes it sing . 	Amplifier
I purchased this to boost the signal strength of my cable connection -LRB- TV and internet -RRB- and it worked exactly how it was supposed to . Overall I had a -1 reduction of signal to noise ration , a gain of +11 dBmV even with 2 -3.5 dbmV splitters on the line and a +4 dBmV gain on the upstream . I use this line for my cable modem , 2 TV tuner cards and a Vonage phone line for my home phone service and noticed an overall improvement all around . The only drawback I noticed were that the 2 coaxial cables that came with it , even gold plated , had very thin weak center wires , which I did n't trust and used my own coax that cable company had given me . Overall though if your downstream signal for your cable modem is weak this will boost that signal . This does n't speed up downloads , it just keeps your latency steady which was my main problem . : -RRB- 	Amplifier
Great amp , worked brilliant for 1 month and thereafter started tripping at 30 % volume . My bad luck i installed it a month after i got it and now i cant return it ... that sucks -LRB- return window says 2 months -RRB- 	Amplifier

Hooked this amp up to my old school fosgate 15 's , all I can say is wow , they never hit this hard even with fosgate amps I have had hooked up to them over the 20 years I 've had them . Thats right I bought these subs back in '91 or ' 92 , they still rock big time ! 	Amplifier
Originally surprised that the amp would include a DC power supply at the price , then surprised and disappointed when shipment did not include the power supply . Since none of my 12 v power supplies furnish the required 2 amps , I am a bit put out as I will now need to find one and , if online , pay additional shipping . Also , better QA needs to be done - the volume control sticks badly around mid-point , and has not cleared although I have cycled it back and forth several times . 	Amplifier
Been some time since i have used it so i ca n't remember how well it worked , but it diffidently made a difference . 	Amplifier
I 've always had good luck with Velleman kits , and this one is no exception . Be aware that you 'll need a PS , 50k pot , and speaker to make it functional . Plenty of info in the instructions for novices . 	Amplifier
no not buy this amp its not worth it my sister got it and it already gave out she only had it for a day pyramid stuff sucks !!! 	Amplifier
It resolved ALL our cable reception problems on all my TVS -LRB- 6 -RRB- . It eliminated ghosts , double\/fuzzy images and noise . I believe the cable input is intentionally weak so the cable company can charge you for additional TVs because when you ask for reception service the first question from the serviceman is : '' `` How many TVs are hooked up to their service '' '' . This product is worth ever penny it beats paying the cable company $ 5.00 \/ month per TV . I would highly recommend this product to any one with reception problems . I installed it before all my splitters and it boosted the signal to ALL my TVS some are over 100 feet away . 	Amplifier
Decent wiring kit but these wires are way too small to get really good power to your amplifier . I actually had to bring it with my current 4 gauge wiring kit but if you just want to set up quickly this can work or if you 're balling on a budget it can work but it is advisable to get thicker wires .

To get the best sound imaginable with the E7 and an iPad do the following : purchase the iPad Camera Adapter -LRB- which also is a USB connector -RRB- and connect it to the iPad . Connect the E7 to the Camera Adapter using the E7 's supplied USB to USB mini cable . Connect your headphones -LRB- I use Bose Quiet Comfort -RRB- and start hearing music as you never have before . I use the BASS1 and USB CHG OFF settings on the E7 and turn Equalization Off in the iPad 's iPod settings . I was ready to send the E7 back after not hearing any improvement over the iPad sound using the Fiio E5 and L3 Cable . Using the USB out connection from the iPad lets the E7 use all of its sound technology on the `` raw '' signal from the iPad . Enjoy ! 	Amplifier
I bought this amp and it was supposed to be here the 14th-19th but its the 12th so it deff came earlier and in the amp looks brand spanking new and im bought to hook it up to my 2 15s it says 1100 rms right on the paper . And comes with a little sticker two . 	Amplifier
This signal amplifier did not work at all . I had a weak signal before and got some sound but once this unit was installed - nothing , no sound at all . It did have a red light at the output side but that was the only sign of life . I opened the unit and the circuit board appeared water damaged and dirty . 	Amplifier
Works as advertised . All I wanted to do was hook up an old turn table to a new 5.1 amp that had no turn table connections . Even able to use my old MMC needle . I am not an audiofile but it sounds good to me . 	Amplifier

Did improve my signal but not as much as I had thought it would . I will be honest though , I had REALLY bad signal all the way at the furthest end of my home -LRB- 100 feet run w \/ 5 splitters in between -RRB- . The signal would completely cut out about every 15 to 20 min on some stations now they just get a little digital noise every once in a while but I do n't lose the signal completely . 	Amplifier
I was hoping having this might solve my problem of my bedroom tv not picking up all the stations due to poor signal quality and I was n't too sure about this item mostly because of the brand name but I decided to give it a try and what a mistake that was . After installing the unit I lost all the channels I was getting and got nothing but static . I 'm not sure why this did n't work out but I 'm not willing to try for another preamplifier at this time . I have enough channels so I 'll just deal with that for now . 	Amplifier
This kit is OK but the directions are not well done . They are complete in a sense . But it looks like the instructions were written to work with more than one type of kit . My main complaint is that the kit does not include any theory of operation -LRB- i.e. how the circuit works -RRB- . So even if you build this kit you do n't really learn anything about amplifier circuits -LRB- unless you already happen to know what all the components do -RRB- . Also , the finished kit really does n't make sense because if you want to hear something far away most likely you want a directional microphone , not two divergent microphones . 	Amplifier
This amplifier is amazing . Reviews said it was the newer version and it does n't get hot and this is true . If you are on a budget this amp is amazing for the price and the name brand KENWOOD is excellent quality . I purchased the DUAL 1000 watt 12inch subwoofer to go with this and together they are amazing . 	Amplifier
yea got this amp along with the 12 inch 3200 watt sub thought maybe i would turn it down a little bit well it blew that sub so i got two 15 inch kickers and i have the amp unbridged and it hits way good the amp never over heats and 480 rms at two ohms is perfect for the kickers powers them perfectly 	Amplifier
This product is the exact same one the cable company made me pay for in my last house . The signal boost is excellent and covers the ENTIRE spectrum . Before installing the booster , my QAM tuner only found 5 digital cable channels -LRB- none of my HDTV locals -RRB- . After installing the booster , the same QAM tuner found 85 channels including all my local HDTV channels . 	Amplifier
I bought this product based on its Amazon review , but was disappointed after used it for 1 day . The sound was a bit on the thin side , and it has too much bells and whistles for a product at this price range . If you are looking for a solid amp , take a look at -LRB- ... -RRB- , it is not a lot more expensive . 	Amplifier
I connected this little amp to my ADS L310 speakers which are 4 ohm speakers and tough to drive to a good level . I was very pleased and frankly surprised that such a small amp can drive these speakers . This amp is superb at driving an efficient speaker with a senstivity rating above 87db . I like my music accurate , flat , with the ability to play loud without harshness , and this little bugger delivers . The only problem I encounterd was the power supply cable not seating properly to the power supply . I was unable to slide a 16g speaker wire through the binding post . Also , the volume control had slight play in it . But all in all a well built , true audiophile desktop amp . 	Amplifier
Very clean sound with plenty of power . Distortion specs much better than most of the competition . 	Amplifier
We recently bought an high definition television -LRB- with associated high def . cable box -RRB- and discovered signal loss in both the TV reception and our Internet connection . I installed this product at the point of entry into the house and solved all of our issues -LRB- TV reception and Internet -RRB- . This particular product only has one output so this was my only option -LRB- one of the cable connections is used to power the booster -RRB- . The output then went to another splitter which provides cable outlets throughout the house as well as high-speed Internet . I have six cable outlets -LRB- one high definition TV box -RRB- and one high speed Internet outlet being served by this booster with no issues . It made me look good with a skeptical family .

I have tried in many examples , to see a difference between the signal from this device and from the video being connected directly into the recording device , and I can see no `` appreciable '' difference . I 've tried `` blind '' test DVD 's to see if I can see a difference , and I just ca n't . If you need to feed multiple recording or input devices , this is the device . You ca n't beat the price . This device along with other CE Labs devices are used in countless showrooms -LRB- Costco , department stores , etc. -RRB- to distribute video to the many TV 's on sale . Blown away by the great picture on that TV on the sales floor ? It is most likely distributed by a CE Labs product . That 's how good it is . This device certainly meets the standards of the home consumer user . Get it while you can . 	Amplifier
I bought this specifically for use with my AKG Q701s . I 've only had it for about a couple of days , but i 've gotta say it 's pretty nice . It 's easy to use , has a nice minimalistic design going for it , and supposedly a ridiculously long battery life on a full charge -LRB- 80 hours -RRB- . I still have yet to see if that 's forreal or not , but it 's good to know that it 's possible . I 've read a couple reviews saying that the menu was complicated to use , but after going through the menus myself , i personally do n't see what 's so complicated about it . I almost kinda wish there were more menu options ... kinda . The only menu option i really played around with was the EQ -LRB- bass boost -RRB- . Not anywhere near as intricate as some other EQs that i 've used , but i liked that FiiO kept it simple . The only thing i really have to complain about is that the max volume level is n't as loud as i was hoping for it to be . I do n't know if it 's because of the headphones i 'm using or what , but i just wish it would go a little bit louder . I 'm not saying that this thing does n't get loud , because there were some songs that i was listening to where i definitely had to turn the volume down to be able to enjoy what i was listening to , so i guess it depends on what kind of a setup you 've got going . Anyways , I like this thing a lot so far . Only four stars thO because of the whole volume thing . 	Amplifier
OK , nobody is buying this amp because it 's the best . But it IS cheap , and at least the one I received worked perfectly . It looks good enough to put on a shelf , and the volume indicator on the front is a good piece of visual bling . My main objections to this unit are that the mic inputs are unbalanced on 1\/4 '' jacks located on the front panel . I had some concern that with the relatively long mic cable I needed to use , I might start picking up the local radio station or general interference ; happily , that was not the case , and with a quickie 1\/4 '' to XLR adapter , the system worked perfectly . Others have commented that this unit does not approach the listed 120 watts , but is much closer to 40 watts ; that 's undoubtedly true , but it 's also the cheapest available 40 watt amp with 70 volt outputs . The fact that it has 2 mic inputs as well as a front panel input for portable players - walkmen -LRB- remember walkmen ? -RRB- or mp3 players makes for a nice install . Would I rather have a Crown ? Sure . And when Crown starts making similar units available for well under $ 100 , I 'll certainly go with them . Assuming this one does n't die in the next year or so , it 's great value for the money . 	Amplifier
i would of given it 5 stars but it did n't do what i thought . Package says will boost for internet and so do reviews . well after four test in different areas it does not . It does boost cable television signal though . Bottom line is this . I have a weak cable signal coming into my house . The lower channels are fuzzy . My internet signal running through the same line is obviously also weak . I can hook the main feed up to the sb5100 modem and it goes online . after i run it through just one splitter it will not . This device was put on before the splitter and the feed works directly from the booster for internet but still after one splitter it will not . But cable works great . . even all low channels now come in clear . IF you are using this to try and up your signal for internet this is not the right device . 	Amplifier
Waste of money , i knew i should ` nt of ordered this antenna . It 's flimsy , cheap plastic only looks nice .

good item for small speakers . can regulate the bass and treble . sound quality limited passed 3\/4 of its volume i would give a 2 stars for overall quality 3 stars for performance 4 stars for design and size for the same type i strongly recommend the Dayton Audio DTA-1 Class T Digital AC\/DC Amplifier 15 WPC 	Amplifier

Got it for Christmas . Hooked up with Bose Acoustic Mass 5:1 -LRB- left over HT now set up as 2:1 , drop 3 cube speakers -RRB- . Source is Onkyo CD 6-disc player .

Like the Amazon price and prompt delivery , plus Free Shipping . 	Amplifier
This is a decent amp for the price . It will not push multiple speakers at the wattage advertised . I am using it to push one 10 '' subwoofer . It does the job and I 'm happy with it , but would not purchase it for a larger system . 	Amplifier
Purchased this after reading a glowing review on CNET . The unit was everything CNET described : fairly attractive , super small , but not necessarily the best build quality . Given the small price , it was worth a shot for what I wanted it for -- which was to amplify ambient audio from my iPad in the bedroom using some bookshelf speakers I had on hand . The unit worked well for roughly 24 hours . I turned it on the first evening , and left it running until bedtime the next evening , when I discovered it had died . My wife and I enjoy ambient sounds while sleeping , so we were sorely disappointed that it did n't work out . I returned the unit for Amazon credit and will shop for a similar product with a better reputation for quality . 	Amplifier
First , let me start off by saying that I am a musician , not an audiophile . While I enjoy listening to music , I often go into it with the specific purpose of learning the parts . I recently bought an Axe-Fx II processor for my guitar , which enabled me to ditch my desktop computer with fancy PCIe sound card\/MIDI adapter in favor of a simple laptop setup using USB . As part of this switch , however , I lost the ability to play high-fidelity music except through the Axe-Fx II as a sound interface . The headphone output from the laptop is complete garbage , it 's completely unusable . I bought this product for 3 specific purposes : 1 . Listening to music from my laptop while at the office . This is a great way to block out distractions , but only if you can stand the sound coming out of your cans . I wanted a simple outboard DAC\/headphone amp which did not require some special Windows driver that would produce quality output and replace the built-in sound . Check . 2 . I was having trouble picking out the bass parts on some songs . My headphones were decent , but not fantastic -LRB- Sony MDR-V900 and AKG K240 -RRB- . However , I needed something that could produce quality sound at higher output levels than I had . Check . 3 . I wanted a preamp\/headphone amp other than my Axe-Fx II which could both amplify my sound from a variety of sources and also output directly to my mixer . While this unit does n't have balanced outs , they 're not really needed for simple DAC\/preamp to mixer purposes at home . It also allows me to run 600-ohm headphones from my Axe-Fx II -LRB- whose headphone output does n't put out enough power for this -RRB- by taking the S\/PDIF output from the Axe-Fx II directly into the Icon HDP . It sounds amazing . The sound improvement is quite noticeable , especially in the area of bass , where the headphones draw the most current . The noise floor on this thing is also ridiculously low ; it 's dead silent when there 's no material playing , even when turned up to high volumes . I 'm getting a pair of Beyerdynamic DT 880 -LRB- 600-ohm -RRB- to use with this for really critical listening . In addition to the great features and sound , the build quality is also excellent , as you would expect from something in this price range . I 'm not going to try it , but I 'm pretty sure this thing would survive a drop onto a hard surface . I highly recommend this if you 're in the market for a really high-end DAC\/preamp\/headphone amp . If you do n't need the preamp features , go for the Icon HD instead . 	Amplifier
I bought this based on the reviews here and on some other forums , and I made the right decision . I bought the booster to improve the quality of my analog cable channels -- the digital and HD channels were excellent prior to using the booster , but all of the analog channels were virtually unwatchable through the snow . Hookup is a snap , and within 5 minutes the picture to all of the cable boxes in my house got a lot better . My cable modem speeds seem unaffected -LRB- my speeds were far above average so there was n't much room to improve -RRB- and the HD and Digital channels still look great . And best of all , the analog channels look almost perfect . Highly recommended !! 	Amplifier
This item was exactly as described brand new !!! It was shipped promptly and had no issues !!! That is all I can ever ask for !!! 	Amplifier
I am impressed with this pre-amp 's performance . Even a high quality RG6 cable has substantial signal loss . In my application a 90 foot run of RG6 had an objectionable loss of signal and made my seven element combination antenna unsuitable for my location . I opted for a very large antenna without a preamp only to find out later that with the use of this pre-amp my small combination rooftop antenna would have done the trick . Now with the large antenna on a rotor and this pre-amp I have more than sufficient signal to run a 4-way passive splitter . I read that this pre-amp is discontinued but some vendors still have sufficient stock . 	Amplifier
I just got the amp installed , it says it goes down to 2 ohm but it does 1 ohm and over heats quickly -LRB- 10-20 minutes depending how hard the bass is -RRB- . Also its not a 2 gauge power termanal , its a 4 gauge and its hard to get 4 gauge in it . In a 2008 civic w\/stock battery -LRB- small -RRB- , 20F capacitor , pushing 2 2400w pyle dvc 4ohm 12s in 2 large vented boxes . Its LOUD , headlights dim alot , would be louder with a bigger battery . If you get this amp you might want a capacitor and upgrade the battery . Its defenatly not 2000watts but its ways up there , it takes 3 25 amp fuses which is one way to determine how much amperage it pulls . Bottom line , this amp is worth alot more than what it costs .

It 's been a good receiver . At the price I would buy this receiver again . I ' v had positive results after using the receiver for two months . Fortunately there 's no issues with mine , it has worked flawlessly from the first time I used it . It 's a nice mid range amplified receiver , worth the investment . 	Amplifier
For the money I am happy , good sound improvement but not much on the volume side but for the size and price im not to surprised the only draw back is that the battery is not replaceable so when it dies you have to replace the whole unit the manual says you should get 100 's of charges out of it ? overall I am happy with the improvement when I play my Sansa MP3 player .

There are several types of rechargable battery sets out there . I did n't realize this when I started looking . You want to watch for the packs that recharge based on just time . These can overcharge your batteries and lead to a shorter battery life . The Sony kit uses a smart charger that senses how much charge is left in the batteries and only charges them to full , leading to a longer battery life over time . Great price and easy to use as well . Ca n't go wrong with this set . 	Battery
I 've spent hundreds , using my digital camera , on batteries . But not anymore ! Though no battery has forever stamped on it , it is greater not to have to run out to the store in the middle of a gathering or a photo shoot . When it gets hot , it really gets hot , so watch it after an hour of charging . 	Battery
While I agree that the binoculars can be adjusted to fit different individuals the range of adjustment is too small and will NOT accomodate some women and alsmost all children . 	Battery
I read a few mixed responses about this product . Though I did n't get to use this too many times , I think the product overall is on the better side . Oh ! BTW , prompt delivery too . . 	Battery
I could n't be more pleased with this pair of binoculars . The stabilizer button works really well and even when not depressed the binoculars are never shakey like others we have tried . At dusk -LRB- and night -RRB- the objects you are viewing actually appear brighter than the available light . Focusing is easy and quick . I definitely recommend this pair - now my husband wants a pair like mine ! 	Battery
Bought two Identical cameras over Christmas for my wife and daughter . Of course buying regular batteries can get expensive so rechargable batteries is the way to go and you can do no better than these . 	Battery
great charger ... takes a while to charge , but the battery charge is long lasting ... perfect for a whole day 's picture shoot 	Battery
I 've tried many batteries for my digital camera and other devices , and for me these have really lasted a noticably longer time . I like 'em . 	Battery
I really like these batteries for our camera . They last much longer than more standard alkaline batteries , even from the major vendors . 	Battery
I have purchased and used these before in 2 digital cameras and they were great , purchased 16 more and then would not hold a charge for more than 2 days and they were dead without use . Returned to Rayovac and they send replacement batteris , but they did not send quick charge . 	Battery
a nice and compact unit . bought it specifically for a nikon sb-600 flash , although i 'm sure it would work as well with point and shoots or other electronic devices . auto shut-off feature is nice . a good deal with the batteries , which work really well with the flash . after shooting about 100 photos , i put the batteries back into the unit and they still registered as full -- the LCD 's did n't blink . nikon boasts 200 shots on regular AAs , so for Ni-Mh a conservative estimate would be 25-50 % more life , the sb-600 's standby feature , which means the batteries are n't on all the time , probably adds another 25-50 % worth of juice , i 'd wager . will probably spring for an extra set of batteries , a no-brainer since a 4-pack of disposable AA 's is about half the price of a 2500 Mah 4-pack . the one gripe with this set : what 's up with the name ? full charge takes about 4-5 hours , that 's not super-quick . anyway , get it , it 's a good deal . break the disposable habit and start recycling energy now ! 	Battery
I have never had a product from Sony that was n't wonderful until this . I have fully charged both sets of batteries numerous times and they wo n't hold a charge . Every time I go to use my Sony digital camera the batteries are dead . So I try the extra set and they are also dead . I charge them again , install them in the camera and store it for later use . I 've repeated this 5 or 6 times since July 1st and I give up . 	Battery
About once every six months I buy something where the quality or functionality blows me away . It 's probably more likely through e-commerce when you 've never actually seen the product -LRB- power of low expectations -RRB- . Anyway , these 10x30 IS binoculars get the six month award . I looked at -LRB- more expensive -RRB- image stabilized binoculars and these are hands down better . No jerky movement when panning -- Excellent stabilized image ... No achromatic distortion , bright , clear flat image out to the edge , wide field of view , huge focusing range , ample eye relief , gigantic exit pupil , no backlash in the focuser , all in a lightweight small package . I 'm going to buy more stuff I 've never seen . 	Battery
WOW ! I had Kodak Max 1700mAh batteries and used them for my digital camera and it lasted me quite awhile . However , I just purchased these Kodak 1850mAh batteries and I am blown away ! These batteries have lasted so much longer than my 1700s ! It is a great buy compared to retail stores with Kodak rechargeable batteries . Amazon.com 's price is a great buy and you will love these Kodak 1850mAh batteries . You will never go back to alkaline ever again ! 	Battery
Given that the batteries alone cost $ 12 , at least here on Amazon , I 'd say you ca n't go wrong with this deal . You 're paying $ 6.50 for the charger . I just finished charging the four batteries that came with the unit , and everything seems fine . My digital camera seems to agree . The LED came on a few seconds after I plugged the unit in , and it was out when I looked at it about five hours later , indicating full charge . -LRB- The manual estimates 310 minutes for 4 AA NiMH batteries -RRB- . Just in case you 're wondering , the four small circles that you see in the picture are not LEDs . They are evidently just air holes . There is only one LED . I kind of wonder if Sony took out 4 LEDs from its original design , but that ca n't explain the huge price cut . I had the top closed when charging the battery , which some other reviewers have warned against , but I did not perceive any overheating . In fact , when I noticed that the LED had gone out , the batteries were room temperature . -LRB- I was charging with the US flavor : 110 V. Some other reviewers have reported significant heating when using 240 V. -RRB- The folding plug is a great feature . I 've loved this idea ever since I first saw the charger for Mac laptops -- it 's much easier to carry around a smooth rectangular box . I 'll trade potential clutter at the wall outlet for portability any day . I used an extension cord for the initial charge , in any case . Overall , the unit is sleek and compact . It 's about the same size as a desktop computer 's mouse , so it 's going to be easy to stuff it in a pocket or whatever bag the camera is in . Obviously , I ca n't comment on battery life yet . Other than that , I 'm completely happy . Oh , one more thing . Give Sony 's packaging design people some bonus points : the blister pack had a little starter tab on the back , and the package was pre-scored , so opening it was as easy as pie . Or , as easy as opening a pull-tab can of nuts , to mix metaphors a little less . It 's nice to avoid the need for dangerous scissor stunts , especially when the resident manx is trying to help with the unpacking . 	Battery
It is definitely a good lucking item . The LCD indicator are not so accurate . Takes long time to charge . It is not a super quick charger . May be a bit quicker than normal charges . But definitely not 15 mins charget . Takes more than 1 hr to charge well . 	Battery
Charger is intellegent , knowing how much to charge and when to stop . Very easy to use . 	Battery
GREAT PRICE GREAT DEAL - GOOD BUY TO BUYING BATTERIES EVERY MONTH . I WOULD RECOMMEND THIS TYPE OF PRODUCT AND SELLER TO EVERYO ONE . EG 	Battery
Purchased this charger in Sept 2006 which came with Sony Brand 2700mah rechargeable batteries . First recharge was great . Used the refresh feature and charged the Sony 2700mah batteries as directed . Batteries held charge even 2 weeks without use -LRB- digital camera -RRB- . When I did use the camera , i got close to 300 shots with flash . Little use since that initial use\/charge . Recently things have not been so good . Refresh and charged the 2700 batteries , put in the camera and everything starts up fine and i take 1 test picture . Put away the camera -LRB- to be used in a couple of days -RRB- ; bring the camera , power-it-up and `` low battery '' indicator turns on . Refresh and recharge the 2700 's again , can power up and take shots immedicately , but after about a day or so , the batteries are dead . Refresh and recharge a set of Sony 2500mah with the same charger and they work great -LRB- hold charge -RRB- . Used a non-brand charger for the 2700s ; charges fine , but after about 2 days , the batteries are dead again . My only conclusion is that my unit was shipped with defective Sony 2700s that now ca n't hold a charge for more than 1 day . Will need to see if i can claim something under warranty , but knowing Sony , the warranty probably expired 90 days after purchase ... bummer ! 	Battery
I 've used various NiMH chargers for years , and this is probably the worst I 've ever used . I keep it next to my computer to charge AA batteries for my bluetooth keyboard and mouse , and the batteries last approximately 1.5 days before they need another charge . If I put the exact same batteries into my $ 15 energizer charger I bought from walgreens , they last for weeks . This is regardless of whether I use the new Sony batteries that came with the device , or the energizers I get from walgreens . It 's also very aggressive about reporting that batteries are past their usable lifetime . Some of the batteries I just got with the device are already dead after only a few charge cycles . Perhaps I got a dud , but I will stay away from sony chargers in the future . 	Battery
The sony batteries retain power for a long time . I do not need to recharge frequently . 	Battery
I bought this because some other rechargeable batteries I had died . The price was much better than Canon and it works just as well . It recharges my batteries fast and I can also recharge my AAA batteries in this charger . I had a different charger which I misplaced , so this was good even without the batteries . This is also great to travel because it works on 110-240 which helps me to charge my batteries at night overseas and the next day my camera is ready to go and I have extra batteries . Many times during overseas trips I had to keep buying unreliable and\/or expensive batteries . This was a great buy . Thanks . 	Battery
This is a great charger and it charges in about an hour so you can have charged batteries . the bateries are a little expensive but its worth the money . 	Battery
I have enjoyed looking through some of the finer binos out there and was really taken back by the quality of the Canon 12x36 IS II binos . They feel solid and well made . The controls are well placed and the cups feel good . The IS button is well placed and comfortable to use . I wish it had a lock-on feature so I could move my hands around . Battery life seems reasonable to me . The case lacks padding , but this is a minor issue . The size of the binos is a compromise between capability and size . They feel a little bulky , but this is expected with the IS feature . It is very easy to adapt to the feel of these binos and they balance well . They provide a sharp and crisp image and the IS feature is amazing . It does not compensate for the larger hand movements , but does stabilize all the minor shakes that come from hand holding a 12x bino . I was even able to use them when moving in a car . It took some practice , but after some practice reducing the larger bumps I could easily read license plates hundreds of yards down the road . This feature is well worth having . I find that 12x makes viewing nature all the more enjoyable . After all , the purpose of a bino is to magnify detail and a 12x bino does it better than a 8x bino . When you see a steady 12x image and compare this to a slightly sharper brighter image of a top of the line ` alpha ' bino , you might agree that the Canon IS with 12x makes more of a difference to your overall bino experience than the superior image of the higher end bino . To me it was not close . Some have complained about them being dark and while I agree that they do not match up with binos costing $ 1500 and more . It is really not an issue for me . The fact that you have a 12x magnification is going to make them a little darker and they are not 42mm glass but 36mm which again means a slightly darker image . The coating are not on pare with the ` alpha ' class binos , but for the vast majority of users this will not be an issue . Do not be misled these are bright binos for what they are and I find they work well in low light . They have a nice flat field and the details are sharp across the field . Would I buy them again ? Yes I would not hesitate to do so . This is a high quality bino with some trade offs , but overall for ~ $ 500 it is a great , if not exceptional , bino value . The ability to have a steady 12x is amazing and takes the bino experience to a new level . I wish Canon would have included integrated front caps and I would have liked to have this pair waterproofed , but then the cost would increase . Based on overall value I feel this bino deserves 5 stars . 	Battery
I 've owned a pair of Leica 10x binoculars and have always been very happy with their superb optics and excellent quality . My only problem was that at 10x magnification , I was unable to keep them perfectly steady when viewing something - a problem I figured I 'd just have to live with . Then I was in my local camera shop and saw a pair of Canon 10x30IS binoculars on display . I thought I 'd try them just to see how close they came to my Leica 's in optical quality . Boy , was I surprised ! Not only were the optics very good , but with the image stabilization turned on they blew my Leica 10x away ! I could see so much more detail , with less eye strain and in a lightweight package . I bought them on the spot , and sold my Leica 10x to a friend - the Canon 10x30IS is my one and only choice for a 10x binocular now ! 	Battery
I used these in my older Sharper Image flashlight . The batteries lasted for a couple years so I decided to use Sanyo again . 	Battery
I received the battery , charged it , using my Canon charger , inserted it into the camera , and have been very satisfied . No more `` charge battery '' warnings appearing on my camera screen . 	Battery
About two years ago I bought a Rayovac 15 Minute battery charger and several Rayovac 15 minute AA batteries . I was not sure it would live up to its claims , but I decided to give it a try . WOW ! It was everything Rayovac claimed . True 15 minute charging with no memory to shorten battery life . The batteries hold a charge at least as long as others , too . I origionally bought this for my digital camera , but now have all AA and AAA batteries in remotes , toys , clocks , etc. converted to the new system . And the best part ... ALL of my origional batteries are in service and working as new . Not one failure . THIS IS THE BIGGERT CHANGE IN AA AND AAA BATTERIES SINCE THIER ONSET . They are not the least expensive initially , but in time saving and life become quite a bargain . 	Battery
We bought this for the ultimate battery-eater : the Wii . These batteries last far longer than alkaline and are a definite money saver . The charger takes about four hours to charge a set of four . The flip door comes off easily and I left it off to dissipate the heat -LRB- which I think will extend the battery life -RRB- . The long charge is a pain , but they batteries last longer than any quick-charge battery I have ever owned . 	Battery
this charger that canon has is a good one that comes in a box . its a fast charging w \/ a type 2LH battery . and its a take along w \/ you design w \/ no cords to worry . 	Battery
These 2100mah Sony AA batteries and charger are the best I own . I have many different brands , Energizer , Kodak , Panasonic etc. and probably a 1\/2 dozen chargers . <p> As some may or may not know batteries that are `` trickle or slow '' charged will last a good bit longer . This charger takes about 6-7 hours before the full indicator light goes off . On quick charger 15-60 min ones they still fair well but of course not as nearly as long as slow charges . <p> If you have a digital camera and are using disposable batteries this is a necessary cost saving purchase . So often in Camera reviews people complain `` It eats batteries '' It is best to have 2 to 3 extra sets and a set runs down - who cares ! Throw them in the charger and switch sets . 	Battery
This charger works as advertised , charges the batteries quickly and turns off when they are charged , if you forget to pull them out . 	Battery
Batteries charged within time it said they would . Batteries have been used for 3 hours and still running strong . 	Battery
This thing is great . If you 're patient , this battery charger will make old rechargeables you thought were useless hold a charge again -LRB- Refresh Mode -RRB- . It easily saved me its cost in batteries it restored . As a simple charger , it 's relatively fast but nothing to get excited over . 	Battery
I 've had these binoculars for 3 years and use them for bird watching . Love them . Fantastic glass and the image stabilization works like a charm . I ended up buying two more for my parents and they also love them and wo n't take any trip without them . They do a good job gathering light on dark and dreary days and focus very easily . I have had no problems with them , and I 'm pretty tough on equipment . I 've owned many binoculars in my lifetime and have always had a problem with glass in either one of the tubes `` slipping '' and not being able to focus through both eyes simultaneously . I have n't had a single problem with these , and I 've dropped them several times . I highly recommend these binoculars . 	Battery
do n't get this unit thinking , `` o cool it comes with batteries . '' although i do n't have any complaints as far as the charger yet -LRB- only 1 month in -RRB- , i 'm sure there 's a charger equally as good for less somewhere . I chose not to go with the La Crosse Technology BC-900 because of comments that said sometimes it ca n't read batteries that are still ok because of its sensing feature for bad batteries . This one supposedly does everything it can do for cheaper automatically without the need to set paramenters like on the La Cross . My suggestion would be to get the sanyo eneloops batteries with a sanyo charger and get the la cross too . the cheap sanyo charger can charge the batteries the la cross rejects and the la cross will be able to refresh your batteries , giving them a great boost in capacity and increasing the overall life of the battery . Plus , it comes with converters to turn your AA into C or D. there 's no beating those eneloop batteries though . they 're a must have . 	Battery
Used this battery charger for many hours . Saves buying disposable batteries , and helps the environment . 	Battery
I bought this particular one because it will be adaptable to European and USA voltages . We burned out three chargers on the advice of our `` guide '' . It is not the super quick one , but takes about four hours . Got this one because it will not minimize life of rechargeable batteries . Definitely recommend . 	Battery
I bought one of these , and the batteries _ never _ did charge . The meter on the front of the charger unit shows full , but if I remove the batteries out and put them in the next second , they start charging freshly -LRB- note : The mode of the charger is on `` charge '' , not `` recycle '' . I actually had the patience to get it -LRB- charger + batteries -RRB- replaced by Sony , and the replacement has the same problem . This is extremely odd since I would n't expect 2 fresh pieces to have the same problem . 	Battery
This is a simple 4 battery charger that I am using for my digital camera . Works great and lives up to lots of turning the camera on and off ! 	Battery
Do n't be a scroog . Pop for this extra , you deserve it . This little jewel fits in any bag and makes charging soooo much easier than wiring up your camcorder . Light tells you when battery is finished charging . Charges any of my batteries in less than an hour . I get one for all of my cameras . 	Battery
Bought this product before going on vacation since I could n't locate the original adapter for my camera -LRB- thanks to my 3yo 's facination with cords -RRB- . I love the smaller design and it charged quickly . It packs up in the camera bag nicely . I wo n't have to worry about where it went anymore . 	Battery
I liked the charger very much its sleek definitely compact , Since I have a lot of places to travel I was looking for a compact charger and without an atatched plug since in every country we have a different plug . Futher I found it easy to use just put the batteried and atatche the cord to power , furthe the auto shut feature is nice henc eu can keep the batteries in the night for charging . All in all I give it a 5 star rating , since its quite meeting my expectation . 	Battery
The ad shows retail packaging yet on delivery I received 8 batteries loosely packed in a box . I guess this is what they mean by `` 8-Pack '' . Nowhere does the ad or seller refer to these being sold in bulk rather than properly dated retail type packaging . Other than that , I suspect the batteries will be as good as their reputation . 	Battery
This is the perfect battery to have as a replacement for canon cameras . Lenmar is a generic but a good generic not like the others you find saturated everywhere . The company gave me great service and shipped it in a timely matter . I would say to buy from this retailer without any hesitation . 	Battery
I own a Canon A540 digital camera , and i 'm really passionate about photography . Recently i went to India , so i bought these Super-Quick worldwide chargers along with me to support my cam . Believe me i just had to charge them once and they helped me throughout the trip -LRB- almost -RRB- . With a full charge a couple of these awesome batteries could take around 350 or even more photographs . . Well i do not use flash during th day time , so taking this into account if you used flash always also they would last for atleast 250 photographs which is simply amazing . . I highly recommend this product . Its built quality is amazing , and cuts off when the batteries are fully charged which prevents the batteries from getting overcharged which eventually could damage them . . I did not find any problem with them . I highly recommend them to anybody traveling . . 	Battery
over this charger and so are my NIMH batteries . Does the job with no fuss or bother and lasts indefinetly in my power eating digital camera . Have n't needed to recharge them yet , they seem to last forever -LRB- buy good batteries though , I use the Sony batteries -RRB- . 	Battery

Click on the image of the batteries . A new web page with a zoomed image should show up . Look very closely at the capacity of the battery . You will see 1450mAh . Most NiMH batteries such as the Everyready brand are 1200mAh ! About 1500mAh are the best that I 've seen . The great thing about NiMH batteries is they have no memory and last much longer than ni-cad batteries . <p> Usually you can get over 1000 recharges out of these . I personally have set that has over 300 recharges on them this year . Yes , my digital camera eats batteries and I have a quick charger which is probably harder on them but hey , compared to akalines I 've saved enough to put a down payment on my next camera ! Buy a set now and start saving your own money too . 	Battery
This product seems to work well , and it is nice to reuse rather than creating a lot of trash . 	Battery
17 mins charge while i was having breakfast at a restaurant . my camera is ready for more shooting for the rest of the day ! 	Battery
Tried other chargers but this one is the best by far . Good price and problem free . 	Battery
Here is the deal I have used these type of batteries for a while just buying them locally . These do not come in OEM packaging they come in some kind of plastic bulk packaging . I have a Pentax K-X DSLR that requires AA batteries and these are what I have always used . This time though I had bought the batteries as a backup set just in case what I had in went flat while I was on a trip for memorial weekend . Within two hours and about 200 pictures later I was already getting a low battery warning from the camera . When I get the batteries locally I can get about 600-1000 out of a new set . I do n't know what the difference is with these batteries vs the ones I got where I live but these seem about 1\/4 discharged or something . Otherwise I received them quickly and in good physical condition . 	Battery
I bought this set for my new digital camera and am highly dissapointed . The batteries do not hold a charge as well as other brands do . While the charger may work fine for other things , do not expect your digital camera to run for more than 20 shots on these meek things . Overall , I am very dissapointed and do not recommend this product . 	Battery
Very happy with the order . Delivery time was better than I expected . Will buy again ... 	Battery
I use these batteries in my Canon S2 IS camera . I can get at least 300 shots + video footage on a single charge . Recharging takes 4-5 hours . The batteries that came with mine are indeed 2500mAh . This is going to save me a fortune in batteries over the life of my camera , and keep the landfills a little emptier too . I have no problem recommending these batteries to anyone willing to pay a few extra clams for a good set . 	Battery
Both charger and batteries are good . it lack cover of battery like some other sony charger . but it does its job very well , battery lasts long enough . recommended 	Battery

i came across these by accident and i am SO happy ! when i purchased this kit -LRB- with the provided low level\/use batteries -RRB- i also puchased a higher level battery so they would last longer . when i travel i bring all of my batteries with -LRB- since i can charge them in the car or with a standard outlet -RRB- . the thing i learned early on with my rechargeable batteries is that you can not mix batteries and chargers . you must use the charger that is provided -LRB- so purchase loads of batteries for your desired brand or locate them when you need more -RRB- . the only drawback i 've found is that it 's difficult to locate the AAA batteries -LRB- AA seems to be easy to find -RRB- . one last note ... when i needed more batteries , i contacted the digipower company and they were great at helping me locate just what i needed . they make battereis . that 's it . good luck with wherever your batteries take you ...

Bought the Battery Charger a few weeks ago and it works as advertised . Very quick and versatile too . A great value in my opinion and works much faster than previous chargers I have owned . I would highly recommend this unit . 	Battery
This product works as intended and does it flawlessly . It has a simple purpose and that is to charge your mini-dv batteries in a wall outlet . This is a much easier way to charge camera batteries and provides the extra convenience and benefit of ebing able to charge up an additional battery while filming with your other battery -LRB- assuming you have two , of course -RRB- .

While attending an astronomy club 's night out , one of the members offered to show me a globular cluster using his image stabilized binoculars -LRB- brand unknown -RRB- . As I brought the portion of sky into focus , I pressed the button and -- WOW ! I could clearly see the cluster , not because it was highly magnified , but because my eyes had a chance to focus and process the image . Thoroughly impressed , I walked over to my wife and told her of the experience . A few weeks later , we had a pair of 12x36 Canons , and were counting the moons of Jupiter . My wife wanted her own pair so we would not have to readjust them when sharing . She complained about having to hold down the button all the time , something that I do n't mind doing as I have long fingers . She also wanted a pair that would focus closer . SOLUTIONS : We bought her a pair of 10x30 's , and to hold the button down , we simply wrapped a strong rubber band , compliments of our postal letter carrier , around them and stuck a short piece of 1\/2 '' dowel rod between the rubber band and the button . The dowel rod is connected to the focus knob by a piece of thread so that , when we do not want the button pushed , the dowel rod does not become lost . We have opted to use lithium cells , rather than alkaline , as they are lighter and last longer , and using our rubber band system will likely mean using the IS much more . Some reviewers complain that the image still moves as you move . Yes it does , gracefully . What the Canons do well is take out that itty bitty shake that makes things difficult to concentrate on well enough to observe details . Now I can aprreciate eagles as I smoothly track them in flight , or follow the antics of a chipmunk , or count some of Jupiter 's 63 moons . Some complain about the small size of the `` exit pupil . '' Being that my wife and I are in our 60 's , a 3mm exit pupil is just about all our eyes can accomodate . They do not seem to be difficult to hold in such a way as to see the whole image . Both of us can leave off our glasses -LRB- she is near sighted and I am farsighted -RRB- , which makes the image even more pristine . Thanks to one report of the storage case strap breaking , we have opted to use the strap directly connected to the binocs while they are in the case . We simply zip up the case with the straps coming out the top and have had no problem with that system as of yet . I expect these to require far more protective treatment than our backpacking binocs , and I am quite pleased that they come with a 3-year warranty . I noticed how carefully the astronomy club members treated their equipment and , given how wonderful these Canons are , we will do the same with them . The bottom of their case is padded but , knowing that we will more often than not set them down on that padded end , I have installed a piece of very stiff fiberboard -LRB- like the cover of a 3-ring binder -RRB- in the bottom of the case to resist anything that might try to poke its way into their objective lenses . No matter how good the manufacturing , optics are always a compromise and , because of that , someone who does not know any better will always have a critical comment . You simply can not have it all , at any price . I have been an amateur photographer for over 50 years and consider the optical quality of these to be superb . There is little if any distortion or light loss for nearly 85 % of the field of view . Only as the viewed object approaches the last 15 % of the field -LRB- near the edge -RRB- does distortion become noticeable , certainly not objectionable . And why would I focus my eyes on something near the edge when I can move the binocs to bring the object into the center ? The nice thing about these , in that regard , is that the distortion is so slight as to not bring attention to itself when viewing a central object . I should add , at this point , that my first pair of 12x36s did have a defect in the left ocular . Amazon swapped them out so quickly that the binocs practically passed each other in shipping . Good price , good service , and good viewing . 	Battery
Nothing much left to say except that Nikon is really proud of it and wants your wallet . Bottom line is that if you need the EN-EL4 battery you have to buy a charger for it . 	Battery
If you 've never experienced image stabilization , you owe it to yourself to try it . The first instant you observe it , you ca n't believe your eyes and brain . It 's like magic . Hyperbole ? No. . Fact ? Yes . The device is operated by AA batteries -LRB- as I recall -RRB- and is activated by a light press of a small , comfortably placed button . Press the button , see the image stop shaking . Release the button , see vibrations . Uncanny . Magic . Without a doubt , the best binoculars I 've ever used . Makes 10 power and above useful in a hand-held glass . 	Battery
I have three chargers before I got this one and I think this one is the best . fast charging , good indicator that tells you it is done , and better performance on Sony batteries . I am very satisfied with my purchase so far . 	Battery
The display is nice , but this charger is an overall disappointment . The short cord makes it more portable but harder to use . It must be plugged in with the batteries already installed , a bit inflexible and you ca n't put in one battery while another is charging . It will happily recharge a battery it 's just fully charged , indicating that it is not nearly as smart as the leading `` smart charger . '' On the lighter side , unlike most chargers , it will indeed charge batteries individually , with a mix of AAA and AAs , no need to have two at a time . It will recharge batteries that are completely dead , too . The progress display is nice though not especially informative ; it tells you roughly how far the charge is progressing , and is lit up while charging and dark when done . Overall it 's better than the average `` dumb '' charger but not nearly as good as the LaCrosse BC-900 . Safer , apparently , though , than the BC-900 's prior firmware versions . 	Battery
I have owned many chargers with other brand names . None of them lasted long , so I have gone through 3 chargers in 5 years . Charges tend to run hot and durability can be an issue . This Sony charger has beaten the odds so I went ahead and got 2 more -LRB- they were on sale ! -RRB- . The Refresh feature does extend the usable life of older batteries . The power transformer is integrated into the unit and thus it is easy to pack if needed . Charging time is fairly quick unless the batteries are fully discharged in which case they need to be topped off for a full charge -LRB- let them cool and place them back in the charger one more time -RRB- . I highly recommend this product . 	Battery
The best battery that you can ever find ! if you simply calculate , you wil understand that it 's cheaper than Alkaline ! 	Battery
A quad package of a better environment . Being able to recharge is vital especially at the very high cost basis . <p> Shopping here does have a great benefit in cost comparison as well reviews . Thats why I think , we all look in here and shop . <p> The NiMH batteries do not have a memory so that is another advantage . NiCAD 's do . <p> Kodak I think does charge a premium for its name and private lable on the products . But what do people expect ? Getting a quality package of a product but paying for less ... 	Battery
It does it job well . I like the LCD charging status indicator at the front . It works both in US and in Europe -LRB- very important for me -RRB- . Refresh button is a nice feature . Since there are 15 minutes chargers out there , i would not describe this one as `` Super Quick Charger '' -LRB- as it is written in product description -RRB- . It charges 4 AAA -LRB- 900mAh -RRB- batteries in about 3 hours , and 4 AA -LRB- 2700mAh -RRB- in about 5 hours . That is fast enough for me , but `` super quick '' ... that 's a bit misleading . I would buy this charger again . 	Battery
I have had these for 2 years . i dont think anyone comes back to write a review for a purchase made after 2 years . I have never had any problems with these batteries in the first 2 years . I have a canon 4MP camera with a 1GB card and i have run out of memory but never the charge on the batteries . Now after 2 years of moderate use , the batteries wont charge . They might be losing charge after 2-3 days of charge if they lay around idle . I have used other rechargeable and they are expected to last longer . 	Battery
I bought this charger for canon power shot camera . It charges in long time but charges sufficient for my camera and also display and status on CRT is good thing . Also charger is light weighted and attractive but I faced one problem after traveling , the chargeable cells discharges after check in scan at airport and I was unable to use the chargeable cells after traveling but for ground travel its good product to buy . 	Battery
I am very satisfied with this Sony Charger . I can carry it in my backpack , its light and sleek 	Battery
We have only had to recharge batteries once so far , but it works as promised . 	Battery
They 're batteries ! You can buy them anywhere ! -LRB- probably cheaper ! -RRB- There 's no reason to buy these online because it 's cheaper just to go to store and get them yourself . They 're very good batteries for just about everything you use them for , but there is no reason to buy them online . 	Battery
This is sort of OK but it wouldnt work on my kids toys since all of them require 1.5 V batteries while this is 1.2 V. It would be great if any one can give me details of rechargable 1.5 V batteries . 	Battery
I was expecting to get the Lenmar brand shown on the website but instead received the Accesory Power brand , However , I have been satisfied with the battery . It is rated at 800mah vs the 680mah of the Panaonic battery . It fits my FZ5 and charger as well as the OEM battery and it seems to last longer . 	Battery
This is a great buy . It plugs directly into the wall outlet and a handy ability to folding the prongs back into the unit . In my opinion , it is smaller and lighter than the pictures suggest . It seems about the weight of a pack of gum . There is a light to indicate when charging is complete . Seems well built . 	Battery
Not much to say , other than the batteries and charger work exactly as advertised - highly recommend . 	Battery
I purchased this product reading other buyer 's reviews but when I used this product , I was fully satisfied . 	Battery
I liked the charger but did n't get to use it very long because the batteries quit working . One battery even gave off a plume of gas when it died inflating my flashlight 's on\/off button like a balloon . These are n't the only Sony rechargeable batteries I 've used . The others failed too , just not as dramatically . I do n't get many discharge\/recharge cycles out of them before they refuse to hold any charge . They also go dead sitting on the shelf after about a week and a half . I switched to Eneloop batteries and they are much better . I also recommend a charger that allows you to set a low recharge rate . Quick chargers heat up the batteries and shorten their life . 	Battery
The longevity of the bateries is very good ... a complet day of busy shooting -LRB- around 350-400 snaps -RRB- still left some amount of battery ... the charger is not a super fast charger ... but i typical start charging while i sleep and by the time i wake-up , it 's done and ready ... so not a problem for me . 	Battery
Forget whatever you thought binoculars were all about . All you need to know is that , with the image stbilization feature activated with the simple push of a button , the image becomes completely still , no jitters , no shaking , just a clear , steady image . Watching birds is a real treat with these . Watching anything is a treat . Give yourself a break and just plunk down the money . You wo n't regret it . 	Battery
I bought this for my digital camera and found it to be simple to use and carry right in my camera case . Works great ! The lid seems to fall off easy but it is only . 	Battery
I 've been using these for several months now and they work great . I use them in a Canon digital camera that takes all 4 batteries at once . They last really well and unlike other NiMh batteries these really hold a charge a long time . Ca n't go wrong here . 	Battery
They clearly advertise the CANON CB2LT Battery Charger and show you a picture of it . What you will get is a generic charger . Canon 's charger has polarised plug pins , This one does not . It looks and feels like it is cheaply built . I gave them a 1 star because they do not deliver what they show you on the screen . 	Battery
I try and be frugal as much as I can , but I learned that I should n't cut the corner with batteries . I 've bought many of the store brand batteries and they simply do not last as long as the Energizer batteries , it 's worth paying a few dollars more , because in the long run it 's actually cheaper . 	Battery
I like this charger . It is convenient to charge the extra battery while you are recording with the camcorder . Much easier than plugging up the camcorder to the battery charger !!! 	Battery
Ladies , I ca n't really say why I enjoy this item so much . Let 's just say I do seem to be very demanding on batteries and this has me powered up and ready to go again in no time . Best have two sets of batteries so you are never without . It works exactly as described . Excellent product . 	Battery
This works fine for Sony battaries , but for some unknown reason , wo n't charge other over the counter battaries for the same camera . Disappointing in that respect . 	Battery
Got this 2 days ago and instructions say 18-20 hrs for charging but they fail to tell you that it 's not an automatic shut off . . I forgot that I had plugged it in and I was lucky the batteries did n't explode ... They were so hot that I could hardly hold them ... Not sure about the quality of the batteries but the charger is going in the trash ; I have others . 	Battery
I recently ordered the Kodak NiMH rechargeable batteries from Amazon.com . Much to my surprise , the batteries they sent me have a mAh rating of 1700 !!! I did n't even know they existed until now . All I hope for is that there are no incompatibility issues with with the new Olympus NiMH battery charger which I also ordered from Amazon.com . Either way , it was a great value and purchase . 	Battery
I do n't know how well this kind of battery should work . I use them in my Olympus D-360 camera . They seem to work well . 	Battery
This battery is similar to many of the NiMH rechargeable AA batteries with more than 2100 mAh in that they suffer from a high spontaneous discharge rate . In other words , even if you do not use your electronic items , the batteries will be dead or almost dead within 2 months . This makes these batteries almost useless unless used exclusively in electronics that you will HEAVILY use in a short period of time . It also makes them unable to be stored fully-charged to be used when needed . They will most likely need to be recharged just prior to each use . Alkaline batteries have very very low discharge rates , making them better for items like remote controls . Alkaline 's however are not rechargeable and also can not generate high-currents without a drop in voltage for high current electronics like cameras . The reason I gave the batteries 2 stars is that there is a better rechargeable option -- the Sanyo\/GE Eneloop batteries or Rayovac Hybrid or Kodak `` precharged '' NiMH . These batteries are all listed as a lower 2000-2100 mAh , but they all have unique formulations that allow for a significantly lower discharge rate . This means that they can be used in items like remote controls and other items where you want the batteries to keep their charge for months . Sanyo claims a spontaneous discharge rate of only 15 % for year . Also , I am not happy with this charger as it does not have a recycle\/refresh function which is critical in prolonging the use of NiMh rechargeables . For just a little bit more money , Sony does offer a recharger with their `` refresh '' feature . If you want one of the best chargers , La Crosse Technology sells their BC-900 which has independent charging channels , sophisticated refresh\/recycle functions , and LCD display with digital readouts of the individual battery voltages . I did not give this 1 star , however , because the batteries and the charger do serve one purpose for me . I use these 2500 mAh AA 's right before a high-use application such as a photoshoot where I will use up all the battery power that day . The charger is also used when I am charging a large number of AA 's and do not need to recycle them . -LRB- You do not need to recycle a battery every time , and so this charger can be used in between refreshing . -RRB- 	Battery
If your looking for a GREAT Charger for your Digital Cameras this is the one you better get !!! It is a great little Charger and it come with 4 AA NIMH Batteries . I got this one thru Amazon and LOVE IT . The only thing it needs more is MORE STARS . I would rate this one a 10 ... It also is very nice looking for a Charger !!!! And such a Great Buy at Amazon !!! And yes , it is Super Quick at Charging !!!! 	Battery
I received this almost as soon as I finished typing the order . This thing works great . So far , it seems to be a super deal too . We go thru batteries on my digital camera like water and I was feeling horrible about tossing out batteries every couple days ! This is a great solution . 	Battery
These batteries were recommended by Leupold for new trail cam . They worked better than the Duracell Pile Alkaline I was using . Price was good and shipping was fast ! 	Battery
I really like this charger . First , it charges faster than most rechargeable battery chargers do . Secondly , it is so compact , I brought it with me backpacking in Europe and it was no big deal . Also , the batteries lasted so long in my camera compared to regular AAs . Instead of needing new batteries every day , I needed them every 5 or so . In the end , I think each set of 2 batteries was only charged twice on the month long trip , which to me is not bad at all . Plus , better for the environment . Lastly , it is highly recommended for travelers as well as I only needed a plug adapter and not a power converter . So simple . A great product . 	Battery
i bought this for my father as a retirement gift . at the time i was able to get it at a gold box deal . i also ordered the hdmi cable through amazon which was also a steal . i had no problem hooking it up to the tv nor getting it onto the home network . though the tv it 's connected to is only 720p and not 3d , bluray looks beautiful and it does an excellent job upconverting dvds . 	Blu Ray Player
Product was so easy to set-up , a child could do it . Boots pretty quickly and has more features than we know what to do with . Picture quality for Blu-Ray discs is amazing with our Samsung HDTV . If you have a Samsung HDTV , definitely get a Samsung blu-ray . You wo n't have to program the remote at all - works instantly with other Samsung products . The only `` Con '' with this is the remote . When on-screen typing is required , it 's a major pain to do . Easily rectified with a multi-remote or wireless keyboard though . All in all , this is a top notch blu-ray player ! 	Blu Ray Player
In order to use the ` ready for wireless ' features , you get to go back to a store , and buy a wireless adapter . I have n't found out yet if it has to be the Sony adapter or not . They kind of imply that . Of course , they also kind of implied it was wireless ready . So in my opinion , they ` kind of ' lied . It 's not wireless ready , until you buy the additional part , which if it 's Sony , adds another $ 70 + to the cost . So it 's no longer a bargain . 	Blu Ray Player
I 've wanted an Oppo for quite a while . When I decided the time was right for a Blu-Ray Player , I was tempted by the Panasonic at $ 129 from Costco . I decided that I shouold get what I really wanted and bought the Oppo . This thing is really great ! Plays everything , loads fast , and it just works . My Cd 's sound much better , too . Mark Twitchell 	Blu Ray Player
Bought this at Costco , and three months later am very disappointed . First , the unit is very , very slow . Often , it takes a few minutes to load and start playing a DVD or BluRay disc . Sometimes , the player gets stuck and must be restarted to play a disc . Skipping previews or segments on the disc is very , very slow and often impossible . Second , the Netflix interface is not great . Even the Netflix interface on our Wii is significantly better than the BluRay . In fact , we bought a Roku to watch streaming content because we thought this unit was too slow and unpleasant to use . Third , there is no `` resume play '' feature . When you play a disc and stop it half way through a movie , the player can not remember where you left off and simply begins the disc again from previews and leaves you at the initial menu . This is especially annoying when you have small children who only watch portions of movies at a time , and even more annoying when you want them to watch the movie in Spanish , which requires going through the initial setup every single time you push play . I 'm returning this to Costco and getting a different brand . 	Blu Ray Player
I primarily wanted this player to replace the streaming media box that plays . mkv files stored in the DLink DNS323 network attached storage -LRB- NAS -RRB- not directly connected to the LG BD570 . Setup was fast and I tested a few 1080p . mkv blu-ray rips from the NAS . They played great and looked great . It was interesting to note that not only did the 570 find DLNA servers on my network , but also found network attached devices and was able to navigate through those items . In other words , I do n't believe you need to setup a DLNA device to use this over a network - you can just access the movies off the hard drive of your computer . Why spend $ 120 on a network streaming device when , for $ 70 more , you can get a dvd player and blu-ray player along with it ? 	Blu Ray Player
I bought two of these as the Deal of the Day . Super clear picture , Internet ready . I 'd buy two more ! 	Blu Ray Player
I realy like this Bluray player . It loads Bluray discs super fast . It has great range on Wi-fi and loads Netflix fast without any buffering while watching . However , I like to keep track of one remote at time . You can NOT program the remoteto control a TV other than a current Panasonic model . -LRB- I have a SONY . -RRB- I have wasted 2 hours trying to figure out how to change the remote . It is possible to control other TVs with most Panasonic IR6 remotes . The user manual could have made this clear . For wasting two hours of my time unessisarily , I am rating this 4 stars instead of 5 . 	Blu Ray Player
I am very pleased with this unit . It goes without saying that the Blu-ray picture is outstanding and I really like the easy open and close sensor located on the top of the unit . The cabinet we use for our electronic components is somewhat dark and it can be tough to find various buttons on the equipment . The sensor on top of this unit makes it a snap to quickly open and close the DVD drawer . I also like how quickly this unit responds to commands and uploads the Blu-ray and DVD content . I do n't consider myself to be very tech savvy so I was more than a little concerned that the process of setting up the internet connection on this device would be a challenge . It was n't at all . The on-screen menu walked me through the process in a very reasonable amount of time . One of the main reasons I purchased this unit is the ability to instantly watch Netflix movies . Based on some of the previous reviews I was concerned that downloading the appropriate firmware would be difficult and that I would have to jump through a variety of hoops to get Netflix to work . That was n't the case . The process went smoothly and we have been instantly streaming movies without much problem . We are encountering an occasional and annoying flicker of the screen , which is why I gave this four stars instead of five . Not sure if that is fair to the unit itself as this may be a problem with Netflix . I also appreciate the ability to view pictures via the USB and SD Card slots . This makes it very easy to view your pictures on a large screen . The menu is easy to use and navigation is no problem . Overall I 'm very happy with this purchase . Amazon 's price was the best I found . The unit is everthing I was looking for and the performance exceeds my expectations . 	Blu Ray Player
This is truly a `` plug and play '' unit . It literally took less thsn 2 minutes to plug into the wall outlet and plug in the HDMI cable to the TV . That 's all thats required . It has astounding picture and clarity . This has got to be the best possible deal on a DVD\/BluRay player ever ! 	Blu Ray Player
If anyone pays full price for this player , they got ripped-off . Seems RCA will learn the same thing Bose did about CD recepticals . If they 're made poorly , they give off vibrations . Vibrations distort ; the RCA player vibrates and distorts sound . It produces a background humming and rattling noice that 's very annoying . I bought my RCA player to watch classes \/ lessons while flying and attempted to use my expensive Bose earphones . The vibration distorts all sound coming from the player and is very annoying . I then tried several earphones , to included cheap ones . None stopped the annoying noice produced by the player 's vibrations . If sound is important to you , do n't buy this player until RCA figures out how to get rid of its vibration . 	Blu Ray Player
Waited for months to purchase the Marantz UD5005 BluRay Player . It was finally available , so I ordered right away . Overall , an excellent purchases . HOWEVER , I should have read more about its capabilities . It is n't wireless . Therefore , if I want to take advantage of watching Netflix movies through it , I need to run an ethernet cable to my router . Not a problem , except that that is about 40 feet away . I 'm not sure how many people have their entertainment system next to their internet connection , but I suspect not too many . Does n't seem to be any wireless capability to this very expensive DVD player . I would recommend purchasing a much less expensive -LRB- 75 % less expensive -RRB- Samsung model . The one I have in my study works just fine , has wireless , and cost me $ 125 -LRB- versus $ 500 for the UD5005 -RRB- . UPDATE : I contacted Marantz customer service . Their response was that the UD5005 has to be connected from the player to the wire with an ethernet cable . Without wireless connectivity , I would not recommend the UD5005 . 	Blu Ray Player
Extremely impressed with the intuitive setup ... very fast and very easy . It picked up my wireless signal instantly . The speed of operation has zero delay : within a second of pressing the button on the remote , compared to my old Sony blu-ray which made me wait at least a minute after powering on before opening , closing and loading . Also has a great `` resume '' memory , even after the disk has been ejected and reinserted . And connecting to Netflix was a breeze . Great buy ! 	Blu Ray Player
First off , the player itself is top-notch , sets up quickly and is generally easy to navigate . I am getting superb picture and sound . Standard DVDs also upconvert very well . For the Internet , I am using a wireless 802.11 n connection . The player is about 30 feet away from my router , and connects without a hitch . YouTube videos play great , as do Roxio -LRB- Cinema Now -RRB- . The only Internet-related problem I have is with Netflix , which I ca n't complain too much about because I went in eyes wide open ; other reviewers noted Netflix problems as well . Even with the new V 1.59 firmware upgrade , Netflix video will not stream . You can connect and navigate through an instant queue , but will get a message to the effect of `` Your video is not available , please try later . '' So if you are really looking for Netflix capability , avoid this player . I have been on the phone with Panasonic customer service , which did not blame Netflix , but I was promised a call back from technical support that I 'm still waiting for . My hope is that this will get fixed with a new firmware upgrade . Otherwise I am extremely satisfied . 	Blu Ray Player
This was my first Blu-Ray player , and I got it for about $ 70 at HHGregg . And after my experience with other products there , I 'll never buy another item from HHGregg . But I also will NEVER buy another LG product again . It had constant issues with the remote , taking multiple presses to turn on or eject the disc . And then all of a sudden , I 'd load the Blu-Ray disc for X-Men : The First Class , and nothing . It froze up to the point of having to unplug it to get it to turn off . Then it would n't play my regular DVD 's either . All this in just a matter of months . 8 months later and it 's completely useless . Now I 'm wishing I bought it from Amazon , because their customer service is superior to any other store out there . But alas , HHGregg wo n't do anything about it . So now I have a $ 70 paperweight . Thanks so much LG . I should have known better ... I mean ... I went through half a dozen of your phones in less than a year . Stay away from LG ... and while you 're at it ... stay away from HHGregg too ... shoulda known better and bought from Amazon ! 	Blu Ray Player
I bought this unit after returning a Cambridge Audio Azur 650BD because of non-working USB ports . This is the equipment I 'm using with the Oppo-93 : Epson 8350 HD projector 108 '' diag Da-Lite Model B screen . NAD 712 Amp Aegis Evo 1 -LRB- 2 channel -RRB- The video quality compares very closely to the Cambridge . I did n't see any significant differences between the two . The visual quality of the blu-ray is really incredible compared to my Xbox 360 as a DVD player . In many cases the blu-ray performance of the movies I 'm seeing have been the best presentation of the films I 've ever seen . This has been especially true with Aliens and the Thing . It 's less apparent -LRB- but still beautiful -RRB- in some of the newer movies like The Prestige . The DVD upscaling is pretty good , but I feel like my native DVD player did a more pleasing job playing DVDs . It 's most apparent in animated shows , where there are sharpening artifacts around the dark lines . The Cambridge had the same issues - but I believe both players have the same video circuits . I think DVDs look better played from a DVD player though . I would want to do more testing before I committed to that assessment . In all cases I am using the Oppo to down-mix to stereo . I tried hooking up the Oppo to my Cambridge DAC Magic , but the DAC Magic had only a slight edge -LRB- if any -RRB- when decoding music . The audio quality of the Oppo is beautiful and very detailed . I auditioned this against my Pioneer Elite Laserdisc player , which I was using for CD 's , and the difference was stunning . I never thought of the Pioneer as a slouch with CD 's , but the Oppo was much better . I was able to pick out notes and instruments that seemed muddy in comparison . At one point I was listening to Dire Straits ' Brothers in Arms album and became hypnotized by the experience . Listening to music on this device is a very engaging experience . Playing blu-ray movies , the audio tends to be a bit too dynamic . We sometimes have trouble with the voices being too quiet , and end up turning it up , but then the rest of the movie is too loud -LRB- for our neighbors ... -RRB- I 've begun encoding my DVDs to play on the Oppo . I some trouble with the MP4 format and ended up using MKV , with 5.1 pass-through on the audio . That seems to work just fine . The Oppo did n't like it when I used Handbrake to down-mix to stereo . Overall , the digital movie watching on the Oppo is great . The other features are a little less great , mostly as they relate to internet access . The Netflix interface is very slow compared to the Xbox360 . YouTube is painfully slow . Trying to enter search text with the Oppo remote is an exercise in patience , and the UI is not spectacular . Pandora is usable , if you 're not trying to create stations , but it was so slow one day , it could n't even connect . With all their problems , the internet features in the Oppo , as well as the included WiFi dongle are welcome additions over the Cambridge , and one of the reasons I did n't try another Cambridge when I sent the first one back . Overall , I 'm very pleased with this device and would recommend it in this price range . 	Blu Ray Player
I have had this product for several months now . Samsung apps are pretty good and Netflix and Vudu work well . I have had problems from time to time with the player being able to play certain discs . Usually a firmware upgrade can fix the problem but if you have any issues and have to call customer service , be ready to get treated VERY BADLY and do not expect actual help or basic courtesy . I could n't play a DVD and tried to do an upgrade -LRB- that fixed it the last time I could n't play a DVD -RRB- . I had version 1015.2 . When I tried to upgrade , I got the error `` model information in upgrade file does not match your player '' . I tried repeatedly . I saw online that the latest version is 1015.4 . I tried to upgrade via USB but the player was n't offering to upgrade . So I called customer service . The rep did not even wait for me to tell her the error before she started telling me I had network issues . When she finally stopped talking long enough for me to tell her the error , she said it meant I had the latest firmware . I told her I did n't and she actually told me that 1015.2 and 1015.4 were the SAME ! She said they fix the same issue and I had the latest version ! She said she really could n't help me if I only had one DVD that the player could n't play . I asked to be transferred to a supervisor who when I started to tell the supervisor the problem she transferred me mid-sentence to another rep. I asked to speak to another supervisor and was on hold for over 30 minutes . While sitting on hold , I finally got the USB upgrade to work . Now my DVD plays . Obviously 1015.2 and 1015.4 are NOT the same . Finally a supervisor got on the line . I started to tell him about the poor customer service and he interrupted me and said he would put me on hold to find someone to fix my issue . I told him do not put me on hold because I had already fixed my issue . I asked him if he had any concern at all whatsoever about the poor customer service I had received and he put me on hold . The call got disconnected . End of story . Never buying a Samsung product again . If you have problems with your product . Good luck . Samsung not only will not help you , they will infuriate you and treat you horribly . 	Blu Ray Player
I did n't get mine via Amazon . I spent over a year with the thing trying to get it to work . It played a few movies but it was a chore to get to the movie more times than not . It took on average 15 minutes to show any signs of life . Turn it on , leave room . Wander back in to see if it was working yet . Touch control to open drawer . Leave room . Do laundry . Go back check on Blu-ray player . Do dishes . Go check on blue-ray player . Ah at last drawer is open . Insert disk . Press close drawer and play . Leave room . Read email . Check Facebook . Go check on Blu-ray player . Make tea in kitchen . Check on Blu-Ray player . Ensure TV is on . Make popcorn . Eat popcorn . Ah at last sound indicates movie previews are starting to play at last ! Check time . Ah only an hour has passed since first decided to watch movie . Ca n't skip the previews or the Blu-ray player will shut off and we 'll have to start the entire process over again . Once previews are done it reaches movie menu , press play . Check Facebook in other room . When sound of movie starts go watch movie . Pray it does n't crash halfway through . We do n't watch a lot of movies and with this player we watched less not wanting to endure the hassles of playing one in this player . Today it opted not to play True Grit . After 20 minutes it ejected the disk . I carefully unplugged it . Hooked an old DVD player to my HDTV . I took the Samsung Blu-Ray player outside and set it on a wooden picnic table . Then I got a 10lb sledge hammer out of the shed and had fun whaling away on the Blu-ray player . When it was small pieces and dust I swept up the remains and placed them in a Ziploc bag to take to the e-waste recycling center . RIP Samsung BD-6500 . I truly wish we had never met . I tried contacting Samsung Customer care . They are useless . I did n't need any of the internet features but the thing was hooked up via Ethernet cable to my router . Internet worked fine in my house . Blu-Ray player usually announced it was `` updating '' when we turned it on . We let it update and turned it off since we had by then lost any interest in staring a marathon session of getting a movie to play . We have a Samsung HDTV . When I got the Blu-Ray player I figured the two devices would work well together being both made by Samsung . LOL LOL LOL LOL LOL LOL ... getting some other brand if I ever decide to try a Blu-Ray player again . At this point I really do n't see the appeal of Blu-Ray period . 	Blu Ray Player
Received the DMP-BDT210 last night and today I set about setting it up . I read from other reviewers about updating the firmware , so last night I created the CD . I actually even read the user guide that came with the player . Everything went flawlessly perfect , including entering my 64-character security code\/password for my home network . YouTube plays very well . BluRay video is superb . The problem came when I was setting up for NetFlix . Everything else worked perfectly . I was even able to access my NetFlix queue . I was able to search for movies and TV shows on the NetFlix site through my TV and this BluRay player . But when it came to playing a NetFlix selection , it would not work . Finally I got on my computer , went to the NetFlix site , account settings , `` Activate A NetFlix Ready Device '' and there said , `` Activate Your Netflix Ready Device Follow the instructions on your device to get an activation code . Your computer and device must both be connected to the Internet to activate . '' I read , then re-read the instructions . I searched and then re-searched the on-screen set-up menus and help guides . Nothing . No mention of an Activation Code . I called NexFlix . They are good folks , but they referred me to Panasonic . I called Panasonic , talked to a phone computer for a while , then I was told that the number that I called was not a good number to use , and to dial such-and-such number instead . But that new number was the identical number that I called originally . I knew right then that I was risking insanity if I kept trying that number over and over . So I sent Panasonic an e-mail through their customer service group . Hopefully a real human will answer it soon . Some similar complaints about the very same model are on the Net . Some of them say that it 's -LRB- bad -RRB- luck of the draw -- some machines of this model work with NetFlix , and some do n't . My only option right now is to return the unit to Amazon , then reorder another of the same model and hope it is one of the ones that will work with NetFlix . However , that 's not a very professional way to do business on my part . Amazon has absolutely zero blame here . NetFlix has a little to blame in that the player accesses my NetFlix account -LRB- using my log in and password -RRB- through the player and TV , so why do they also want an activation code ? I 'm already going through my current , active NetFlix account using the very machine they want to verify . But it seems to me that Panasonic holds the most blame in this . They need to fix this bug , and fix it quick . A software patch through another firmware update would fix this . And it would n't cost them any money . It would only cost very frustrated customers like me a little time . Overall the machine works very well . Sound and picture quality are superb . Linking to my home wireless network was much easier than I thought it would be . It 's only a few short seconds from the time I put a BluRay disk in the machine until it began to play . But it does n't provide an Activation Code for NetFlix . It 's 100 % insanity . UPDATE : Panasonic 's firmware update 1.63 fixed the NetFlix problem . My frustration now is that Panasonic initially telling me and countless others that the problem was not their fault . But of course we all now know it was their fault . Their customer service needs some review . Rather than lying to their customers , a simple `` we do n't understand the problem YET '' reply would have been much more appreciated . Accordingly , I 've given the player an overall 5-star rating , but with reservations . 	Blu Ray Player
Initially I really liked this device , has issues with thumbnails of . jpg s. But then it went blank screen after start up . Three support calls later we knew we had to ship it back for repairs . Thank god it was within 90 days of purchasing it -LRB- otherwise way too much to pay for repairs -RRB- . Now 14 days after receiving it and three more phone calls to the factory in Huntsville , AL I 'm told it will be another 30 days for the part to arrive . So I have been without it for 1\/3 of the time I 've owned it . -LRB- Now that is saying they will actually fulfill their statement ... I 'm not holding my breath . -RRB- 	Blu Ray Player
Samsung pulled a fast one . I bought this player and started to set it up . I immediately got a message as follows , `` Due to a change of WiFi policy , this player can not support the TKIP security type in 802.11 mode . In that case , check a security setting on the Access Point '' . After about 8 hours and two calls to AT&T , my DSL carrier , to confirm my settings , I gave up . If you go to Computer Fix forums on the Internet , you will learn that very few buyers of this unit can connect it to the Internet . Some of the `` solutions '' were in `` geek speak '' and I had no idea what they were talking about . My neighbor , who is a computer maven , was unable to help nor did he understand the `` solutions '' . No where in the model specs does it mention this change in WiFi policy . I called Amazon and returned the unit . I then ordered a Sony from Amazon which has not yet arrived and is the same model my neighbor owns . He said he hooked it up and got an Internet connection within minutes . Buyer Beware ! 	Blu Ray Player
Had a small screen Sony wireless internet TV that was being relocated\/replaced with much larger TV and LG 570 Blu - ray player . The LG BD570 Blu-ray was very easy to set up and quickly connected wireless to Netflix to successfully watch a movie ... . . but then major troubles became apparent when attempting to reestablish internet connectivity . The only way to get back on the internet -LRB- Netflix -RRB- is to do a hard factory reset and go back through a cumbersome full initial setup . Internet services other than Netflix never worked at anytime . The LG Blu-ray was replaced with a Sony BD-S570 which was an easy setup and has since worked perfectly in all respects . In addition , Sony internet viewing applications are superior to LG . Amazon provided outstanding service with the return process while LG Customer Service tried to provide good service but was unsuccessful in actually solving service issues . 	Blu Ray Player
Buyer beware !!! The wireless connection does not work and the Samsung customer\/tech support in India is horrible . Wasted several hours on the phone with ` Level 2 ' only to find the player is defective . There are several reviews with the same issues and they are all true . No compensation from Samsung at all . I returned it after 3 days for a refund . 	Blu Ray Player
LG Hit a home run with this Blue Ray Player . I bought this after returning a Visio 231 which had a lot of features but the remote was so cheap it hardly functioned . The 250 Gig Hard drive in this one sold me , along with its ability to access my video library on my home network . This is a great feature . The wifi works very well . I started by hooking it up via wifi , but ended up hooking mine up via ethernet , because accessability was rather easy , and I thought it would speed up my connection to Netflix . Frankly , I have not noticed any difference in Netflix download speed between wireless and wired , so I guess its Comcast , who , by universal affirmation is horrible , in spite of their ridiculously high rates . Ok sorry , back on point . Since I own an LG TV , hooking the blue ray player and TV together could not have been easier , You hook it up via hdmi , turn it on and press the simplink button on the TV . Done . The remote on this unit works with my TV too so everything worked out well . The color coded buttons are a really neat addition . I am very impressed with the quality , and intuitive interface built into LG Electronics . They are very high quality at a fair price point , and they are very user friendly . 	Blu Ray Player
great product ... arrived in a timely manner . I have had no problems with this bluray player . It has exceeded my expectations greatly ! I love it ! 	Blu Ray Player
I got the BD-5500C model from Costco . That model comes with an HDMI cable . That 's the only difference . -LRB- and it was much cheaper at least vs. today 's amazon price . Sorry -RRB- I connected the unit to an older Olevia Syntax 768P LCD with only 1 HDMI port so I needed to dig out my old Monoprice HDX-201E 2x1 powered HDMI switch since my DirecTV HD DVR was already using the HDMI port . There are no handshaking issues with this setup . It works perfectly . I connected the unit to my gigabit LAN network via ethernet . I did the auto setup and it connected , passing all the tests . It plays Blu-Rays beautifully . Even with the 768P display it 's obviously better than DVDs . A couple Blu-Rays did not let me skip the preview so I had to search through them quickly . It did not let me go to the menu either . I had another Blu-Ray movie -LRB- from Blockbuster -RRB- that started freezing . After we removed it and wiped it a little it played well in the spots where it had been freezing . If you 're going to stop the movie , take a note of your ` time in ' because with Blu-Rays , there 's no resume function . Find your way back to the movie and enter in the time with the Tools function . I did try 1 DVD for a few minutes and it played fine . I 'm probably never going to put in another DVD except for some home DVDs I have made . The rest of the review is about the Extras : Youtube has a clunky interface to use and it was disappointing . You do NOT get HD from HD available videos so what 's the point ? Pandora is a lot of fun . It 's the first time I tried that service and it 's very cool . It 's great with wireless phones connected too ! Netflix : I signed up for a trial -LRB- I 've been a Blockbuster Online sub for a while -RRB- and HD videos stream flawlessly . However , at no fault to this unit , the streaming selection that they offer is limited and my wife and I were disappointed that most of those movies do n't include closed captions . She has a mild-moderate hearing loss so the wireless headphones are crucial in that application . I do n't know if we 'll keep the Netflix subscription . Blockbuster : On the other hand , I 'm disappointed that their subscription service does NOT entitle you to their streaming content . I have not purchased any of their content . Vudu : I have n't purchased any content so no comment . Rovi TV Listings : This is a waste of time . The GUI is horrible . If you want to check your guide do yourself a favor and switch to the DVR . The other `` Internet @ TV '' apps are mostly fluff . There 's accuweather , google maps and USA Today . Believe it or not , there are some games like Memory , Quizz Master game , Sodoku , Mahjong . DLNA : I tried the Samsung PC Manager software , TVersity , Mezzmo and Serviio . I found Serviio to do the best job of streaming pictures -LRB- from 2 PC profiles sources -RRB- , music and videos . Formats I 've streamed include . avi , . mp4 and . wmv . Unfortunately , you can not truly search forward and back but you can jump forward about 20 seconds using the right arrow button and you can jump back as well . You can also use the Tools button to enter the minute where you want to go to . This is not perfect yet . There are some files that do n't play but it has been generally reliable and I would expect it improve with the development of Serviio which is free !! Lastly regarding DLNA it has worked better than I anticipated . Since this player plays Blu-Rays smoothly , does Netflix and Pandora so well and is an adequate DLNA server , I do highly recommend it . Since you do n't have more precise control over trick play -LRB- fast forward\/rewind -RRB- via DLNA , I am deducting a star to give it 4 stars . 	Blu Ray Player
I have owned this product for six months and loved it until last week when it quit playing blu ray discs . It has the latest firmware updates . I called LG customer service and it would cost shipping plus $ 70.00 to repair the player . After paying $ 150 for this product I am extremely disappointed . This was my first LG product and I am in no hurry to purchase this brand again after this experience . 	Blu Ray Player
Fast load times , nice remote . Very small , especially compared to DVD players I 've had in the past . In spite of other comments regarding the ` waive your hand to open the disk tray ' feature , I think it is pretty cool . I do n't have a 3D TV , so I ca n't comment on 3D -LRB- I will probably get a 3D TV next year -RRB- . But Blu-Ray disks load fast . I tried the Vudu service -LRB- 1080P \/ HDX -RRB- and it 's very cool . You get a $ 5.99 credit with the player which essentialy equates to one free rental from Vudu . HDX quality blows away any other streaming service I 've tried . I have n't tried the other Internet apps yet . I ca n't believe I paid $ 400 for a Sony BDP-S300 POS years ago that will hardly play any disks anymore and this player was less than $ 130 , PLUS I get Avatar 3D for free -LRB- mail-in -RRB- . EDIT 2\/7\/2012 : My touch-free sensor stopped working after two months . However , I unplugged power for about 5 minutes and that fixed it . 15 seconds wo n't do it ... I tried that first . Give it AT LEAST a minute . Heck , unplug it overnight just to be sure . 	Blu Ray Player
Researched forever before ordering this blue ray player . Wanted one that would stream Netflix onto our hd tv . Works really nice and the wifi setup was really easy . Would recommend to friends . 	Blu Ray Player
Have n't done much more than set it up and make sure everything works . Player works well . The wifi setup was not intuitive and typing anything in is slow and awkward . Netflix streaming seems to work fine . 	Blu Ray Player
I was finally fed up with my Samsung not playing certain blu-ray DVDs even after firmware updates , so the Panasonic is a breath of fresh air - I should have gone with Panasonic in the first place ! 	Blu Ray Player
I just got this today to replace a junk Samsung BD-P3600 . That player always had problems playing new Blu-Ray titles . For example , Cowboys and Aliens would lose audio\/video sync so many times that I was ready to toss the Samsung in the trash . No problems playing any disc including the latest titles with the Oppo ! The Samsung is now relegated to my bedroom for Netflix streaming . And that brings me to some bonus features of the Oppo . There are enough other reviews here that praise the outstanding quality of this player , so I do n't feel the need to add to them other than to echo what they have said . It 's an expensive player but IMHO , worth every penny . It loads Blu-Rays faster than my old DVD player loaded most movies . Simply outstanding ! Anyway , I plugged in the HDMI and ethernet cables and then fired it up . After going through a very easy setup menu that automatically pops up the first time you power on , the Oppo reported that there was a firmware update available . It updated over the internet in minutes with no problems . How refreshing to have a piece of gear that just WORKS ! Now on to the bonus features - I have n't seen it mentioned in any reviews here , but with the latest firmware updates , you now have a lot more streaming content available . In addition to being able to stream content from your DLNA compliant PC\/Mac , you can also get the following : Netflix -LRB- including the latest API that lets you search for titles -RRB- Blockbuster Pandora VuDu Film Fresh Picasa Youtube I think the ability to access these streaming services adds significant value to the player . I did n't see all that mentioned in the other reviews so I thought it important to get the info out there . I have n't tried anything other than Netflix and Pandora yet , as I just got the player this afternoon -LRB- one day after placing the order , thank you Amazon !! -RRB- . Netflix and Pandora are both significant interface upgrades from the Samsung . Overall I 'm VERY happy with this purchase . From what I can see , this appears to be made in the USA ? No wonder it 's so much better than the Chinese and Korean junk that floods the market these days . Quality product , Oppo ! Thank you ! 	Blu Ray Player
I am extremely disappointed with Amazon LLC , because I ordered a Blu-ray player Sony BDP-S370 , instead of that I received a LG BD 550 ... Too much cheaper !!! . Also the product that I have received has many negative reviews !! I really upset . . I have been defrauded by Amazon LLC !!! 	Blu Ray Player
Great player-no issues ! Kind of slow boot up but not overly slow and does n't detract from the overall benefits of the player . I would definitely recommend this player to anyone wanting a wireless blu-ray player on a budget . Set up is very easy-just plug it in and it will walk you through getting setup to the wireless network and you 're ready to go ! 	Blu Ray Player
I purchased this player for three services : DVD upconversion , playing netflix , and DLNA connectivity . I only tested the first two thoroughly , but because I was disappointed by both of these I returned the player before I could fully test the third . On Netflix the audio and video were often out of sync . I only have a 1.5 mbps connection and perhaps this contributes to the issue , but Netflix works great on Apple computers and iPhones with that same connection . A very long session with a knowledgeable Panasonic telephone support provider did not solve the issue , nor did a conversation with Netflix -LRB- suggested as the last resort by Panasonic -RRB- . In addition , the DVD upconversion performed by the BDT210 was noticeably inferior to that produced by an old Toshiba HD-DVD player that I have been using for that purpose since the death of HD-DVD . 	Blu Ray Player
These are excellent players in all formats . BD quality is outstanding , and the upgrade from standard def . DVD works very well . Audio quality on CDs is excellent as well . I 'm using the analog stereo outputs to drive my vintage McIntosh C-32 \/ MC2105 . The sound is fantastic . Highly recommended ! 	Blu Ray Player
Just bought this and am so upset . I have a very fast internet connection running straight into the player . The first day I got this I called and Samsung told me their server was down and there was nothing I could do but wait a few days to connect to `` Smart Hub '' which is how you connect to Netflix , YouTube , Etc. . Now that Ive connected it is SO SLOW . Watching netflix ix impossible . Please do not even consider buying this product . I promise you will regret it . 	Blu Ray Player
I 've been using this as my primary Blu-Ray player for a little while now and I really enjoy it . I 've not tried the netflix streaming function because I already have streaming video from amazon prime and a similar feature from Blockbuster Online . This player does everything you 'd expect from a solid $ 100 BR player . I have n't seen anything skip . The remote is relatively compact and responsive , which is nice when I pair it with my Panasonic TV - I can ditch the TV remote and control both with the BR player remote . A small , but nice little feature is not having to manually change inputs from TV or game console over to BR to watch a movie . When I insert the BR disc , it swaps inputs automatically and starts the BR in less than 5 seconds . So the disc has started usually before I even reach my seat ! I ca n't comment on longevity or durability , since I have n't had it for long . The packaging was great with plenty of impact protection and zero lose pieces . 	Blu Ray Player
So far after a week of use , this has worked great . It is n't as fast as my PS3 , but waiting a few extra seconds to load of Blu Ray discs is n't that big of a deal , to me anyways . I had a hard time choosing between this and the Sony S570 , ultimately went with the Samsung . Netflix after the update works great , have had no problems with it as of yet , Pandora is awesome as well . I have this hooked up to my A\/V receiver and it all works great , amazing audio with HDMI and Blu Ray . One thing I did n't like was the setup for the wireless with my WEP key , the way you input it is a pain in the rear , and I accidently hit the `` clear all '' on my first attempt when I had almost finished entering which was annoying . After it was connected it ran flawlessly without any problems , I guess i 'll have to see how it performs when more devices are running on the network or if I try putting it further away from my router . Other than this I am very satisfied with this purchase , I am still curious to see how the Sony stacks up against this , since I do hear it has faster boot times but a bad wi-fi and netflix . 	Blu Ray Player
This player failed to play blu ray discs , displaying a `` copyright violation '' error for all three netflix blu ray discs that I had on hand . It also failed to connect to Netflix , perhaps in sympathy for generally ignoring netflix media . I downloaded and installed the latest firmware , 1.56 , this made no difference . I tried adjusting settings , adding an SD card , wireless connection , wired connection , no connection , all to no avail . Other reviews also highlight these issues , I should have read them more carefully . It 's going back tomorrow . This is a poor quality product , do not buy it . If you do , you 've been warned . 	Blu Ray Player
I bought this player from Target only to be disappointed in the player lacking a component video output and a digital audio output . The A\/V receiver in my HT does not have HDMI switching on it . That means the best quality I 'm going to get is equal to or less than what my stand alone DVD players offer . If you have HDMI , then you 're good to go . I love Panasonic as a brand , but am disappointed a lot of their Bluray players do not offer component video and digital audio outputs on their players . Because of this , I had to return the player and order the Sony BDP-S380 for roughly the same price . So if your system lacks HDMI connections , you 're screwed with Panasonic 's Bluray Players . 	Blu Ray Player
DESPITE CLAIMING THAT IT GETS AMAZON HD IT DOES N'T GET 5.1 . everything else looks good . but if amazon sells it at least the information should be true . also the rental screen does n't say stereo . and they refused to give me a refund 	Blu Ray Player
I have n't had extensive time with it but so far everything works beautifully and the user interface is kind of cool and modern looking . I do n't see any picture differences so far between this and a $ 500 player a friend has . 	Blu Ray Player
I just switched from an old dvd player to this . Wow ! It connected easily to my router . I was watching youtube and netflix within minutes . It is great . Looks supersmart on the shelf . Very nice design ! Not a single complaint . 	Blu Ray Player
I read a bunch of the reviews on this product before buying this unfortunately I payed more attention to the good ones rather than the bad . I am not going to totally bash this item because it does have some very nice qualities but I did n't really get to enjoy them all . I was yet another one who bought this item mainly to stream Netflix . Did n't even get one movie in . I got the same screen that others have talked about something about unable to play movie try again later . Yah rite . I packed that thing up quicker than I opened it . I have to add here that Amazon has a great return policy so if your going to buy this item buy it from Amazon so if this happens to you you will be able to get your money or a replacement . All in all I love Amazon but am not to happy with my blu ray . If you are buying this blu ray for all the other features and do n't want or need Netflix it probably would be a nice player but as somebody else had said in a previous review no Netflix was a deal breaker for me . One more thing on that though . To put it in context . My mom got the same model and make and hers works fine . She hooked it up and never had a problem and she loves it . So it is now up to you if you want to take the chance of getting the 1 out of how ever many it averages out too in which Netflix does n't work on this item . 	Blu Ray Player
I bought this player purely for its ability to hook to netflix through wifi and hook up to my HDTV . I 'm thrilled with it . The menu is very easy to use , and even my kids are able to get on and play their favorite streaming TV shows through Netflix like Hannah Montana and the like . I had no problem hooking up to my wifi , even with a secure network . And Netflix was extremely simple to hookup as well -- it gave me a code on the screen which I typed into my computer in the other room , and I 've been able to watch ever since . Also connects up with Pandora which lets me listen to free digital music . I do n't even own a blu ray disc -LRB- ! -RRB- so I ca n't rate how my blu ray player works , but then again , who has time to watch blu ray disks with all the streaming movies available on Netflix ! 	Blu Ray Player
Have had few problems with this device . Pandora interface not has good as Toshiba but more stable . Internet speed app has stopped working and Samsung supports fixes have not worked so far . These streaming devices are in their 1st generation and will get better with firmware upgrades . Samsung appears to upgrade the firmware periodicly . 	Blu Ray Player
I bough a Bose v35 also from Amazon and since it doesnt come with a player i needed a quality player to go with it . The priority was clear crisp sound the good picture quality . I wanted something that clould play blue ray and with some 3D capability and essentially to complement my Bose in all respects . So i skippd the SONYs and SAMSUNGs for the highly reputable Marantz , i again found what i was looking for right here on Amazon . I decide to compare the Amazon price with local dealers and it was a no contest , it was so much more reasonable here . Now about the product , it looks really good , it has a beautifil stance sort of like a BMW M3 , one look at it and you know its a powerful player . It produces a crystal clear sound and wont bump or overheat , its consistent CD after CD , Blue Ray after Blue Ray . the first blue ray disk i played was Casino Royale , mind blowing stuff , the sound and picture quality were amazing to say the least . Im really enjoying my Marantz UD5005 , i have no regrets whatsoever it was a wonderful buy and at that price was practically a steal . I would recommend it to anyone who appreciates music , movies and stuff ... 	Blu Ray Player
Amazing all around player with built in wifi . If you dont have blu ray yet I would suggest this player . Its a great value and no netflix streaming issues ! 	Blu Ray Player
The picture quality for Blu-ray and DVD is very good , and the boot time is excellent . However , in just a few uses the machine has shown a tendency to lock up and the only way to resolve the issue is to pull the power cord . This has happened while viewing movies , and looking at photos that are stored on my PC . The Netflix quality is poor . I also have a Roku box that I use for Netflix , and the quality for the Roku far exceeds that of the Panasonic Blu-ray player . Since the quality on the Roku is so much better I do n't consider the Blu-ray player as even being an option if I want to watch anything through Netflix . All things considered it is not a bad Blu-ray player , but the tendency to freeze up makes this a machine that I probably would not recommend . 	Blu Ray Player
I received the product very fast from Amazon.com -LRB- they are always great with this -RRB- . After looking at the instruction for this player and my Denon amplifier I was able to connect this with compoent video and optical audio and set up the player and wireless networking -LRB- secure connectioni -RRB- in about 15 minutes . Very simple to install , good instructions , and so far the on-screen set up of the player is great . Tested Youtube , played a BluRay and standard DVD , and all works very well . I will by trying Netflix I believe next . Overall great product , great value , like all the features -LRB- especially wireless and all the online services -RRB- . 	Blu Ray Player
Once I hooked up my unit I went straight to getting hooked up to the Internet . The player connected fine to my network and the Network Test screen gave me green checks on everything . I then went to the Internet@TV screen and just got a message saying I needed to connect to the internet to enjoy this feature . I have three computers and a Wii that are all connected to the Internet just fine and working . Over the course of the next several days I tried connecting directly to the modem , reconfiguring my modem , tried another modem of the same model , another modem of a different model , a different router , disabled all firewalls everywhere and I still could n't get this player to connect to the Internet . A curiosity is that I also could not download any files -LRB- manuals , firmware , etc. -RRB- from the Samsung downloads site . On their support page , when you click on something to download , it goes to -LRB- ... -RRB- . I could never , from any device in my home , connect to that site . I feel that this is related to the player not connecting as I read some forums of people having the same problem . For those who may want to know , I use Verizon DSL . Verizon support said it was n't their problem . Samsung Level 1 and Level 2 support literally said they did n't know what was wrong . Level 3 Samsung support was supposed to call me back but never did . Something , somewhere was blocking my access to the necessary server . I ultimately returned the player as this was a major reason I bought the player . I did play one blu-ray on it and it was clear . This was my first blu-ray player but it did seem kind of slow to load pretty much everything . I tried really hard to make it work but it was a lost cause . If you happen to read this and are thinking of this player , go try to download some of the support files from the Samsung site first . If it works then you are probably okay . If it does n't then beware of buying this player . 	Blu Ray Player
I own LG products and I like them every much and this blu ray player is no exception . I truly likle LG products and highly recommend it to others . James Jones 	Blu Ray Player
The upload time for DVDs and Blu-rays are fast . It is very easy to set up . The only down side is that the items listed for being connected to the internet is the ONLY things you can connect to . The gaming systems let you log into anything you want Pandora , netflix , search with google but this player only allows you to connect to the things it lists and only those things . But for the price it is GREAT ! 	Blu Ray Player
This Blu Ray player is pretty sweet . It 's a little slow but thats not a huge problem . I like that it plays youtube , pandora and netflix and the UI is very easy to navagate . The only problems I have with it are that it does n't have very many apps -LRB- not a big deal -RRB- , that it has only 60 mb of internal memory -LRB- also not a big deal , you can put an sd card in -RRB- and netflix stops streaming the last 5 mins of the movie or show -LRB- big problem -RRB- . It works great up until the end but its sucks to have to rebuffer to watch the end of a show , especially a suspenceful one . I 'm not sure if its the players fault or netflix 's fault but I sent an error message to netflix but havent gotten anything . I would have rated this product 5 stars but the bad streaming brought it down 	Blu Ray Player
This is a nice player that unfortunately does not show much care for the customers . I bought it because it has a usb plug for wifi connection to my router . What a nasty surprise I got when I found out that it will not accept any of my wireless wifi usb sticks . Samsung forces you to buy their proprietary usb stick . It will cost you another $ 70 dls . or 60 % of the player 's price . WHAT A RIP OFF I can not recommend Samsung products for this reason . I will buy them when they show a little more care for their customers and less greediness . 	Blu Ray Player
Had this blu ray player for a little over a year . It was hooked up to my router through an ethernet cable and everything worked great . I was able to stream netflix and pandora with no problem , until a few days ago ... For no apparent reason it stopped connecting to the internet , giving me a `` Ping Gateway error '' . I am pretty tech savvy and have tried every type of troubleshooting available with no luck . I have read quite a few similar complaints about this unit and have wasted many hours trying to fix it . I finally gave up and invested in a PS3 for my blu ray and streaming . Whether I ever get this thing working properly again or not , no device should be this difficult to manage . 	Blu Ray Player
I usually do n't write many reviews on amazon , but I have a very specific problem with this product , which a few other people out there might be affected by it . Overall the blu-ray player does what it needs to do , it plays blu-rays just fine . Good price for getting a nice and simple blu-ray player . The downside is there is no netflix streaming and there is a powerdown issue with Sharp Aquos TVs . I have a 32 '' Sharp Aquos 1080p TV hooked up via HDMI to the BD530 . If the TV is on when I try to power down the blu-ray player , it will automatically power back up EVERY time . The TV needs to be off in order to prevent it from powering back up . It 's a small issue that probably wo n't affect that many people , but it 's still annoying . I tried playing with all the HDMI settings on both devices , but the problem still exists .

I 've only had the BD570 for a couple of days , but so far so good . It was surprisingly easy to hook up to my wireless network -LRB- I have an 802.11 g router through Verizon Fios -RRB- . I had no trouble screening videos through Netflix or YouTube , but I have not tried Vudu or the music service . This is my third DVD player -LRB- second blu ray player -RRB- and I am amazed at the quality of the audio . My other two players were a Panasonic and a Pioneer and the sound quality is not nearly as good . The picture quality from blu-ray and non-blu ray discs is great . In fact , you can adjust the picture quality of your discs on the particular player , and I could not do that on my other players . This is my time purchasing an LG product , and overall I would say I am very pleased with my purchase . 	Blu Ray Player
I have owned the Panasonic DMP-BDT210 Integrated-Wi-Fi 3D Blu-ray DVD Player for 4 months and I am very happy with its performance . Pros : 1 . Very fast initial disk load time . Best in class according to consumer reports . 2 . Simple on screen menus . 3 . Integrated WiFi . 4 . Fun sensor on the top of the player that opens the disk tray . 5 . Excellent image quality . 6 . Small foot print . Cons : 1 . Occasional disk read error if there are ANY finger prints on the disk . Not a deal breaker since it 's infrequent . 2 . Slightly expensive , but worth it . I would recommend this Blu Ray player as a worthy addition to anyone 's home theater system . 	Blu Ray Player

This is the third Oppo Blu-Ray Player that I have purchased and for good reason . The build quality is incredible . This is one very well made component ! Also the load spped and ease of use makes this a super value for the money . The people at Oppo are great with their customer support and all of my contacts with the company have been nothing but positive . I recommend this palyer with 5 star confidence . You will not be disappointed . Excellent value for the money ! 	Blu Ray Player
7\/19 UPDATE Sorry , I 've been slow in providing the latest update . After reading about the conflicts with WHS , I used it as an excuse to update my server to WHS 2011 . I can report that both the player and WHS 2011 are happily coexisting on my network and that I 've been able to do a LAN based firmware update . So I 'm upping this to a 4 stars because once I got it running this is a darn good basic Blu-Ray player . 4\/2 UPDATE On suggestion from another buyer , I requested an exchange on the chance that I got a defective unit . It did n't work . First , I want to point out that I have a new 50 '' Panasonic X3 , and -LRB- on a separate local switch -RRB- a BD60 and 42 '' G10 using the set up without any issues at all . I do n't have a complicated setup -LRB- router , 24 port house switch , 5 port local switch -RRB- yet the new machine locked up just like the other one . I did bypass the local switch and plugged it directly into the wall plug and got the same result . So , there is something about the implementation that does n't like my setup . Anyway , because the thing is amazingly fast and the network stuff is essentially duplicated from the television , I 'll hang onto the unit and await a firmware update . Original Post I bought this in high anticipation of typical Panasonic quality . So far I 'm very disappointed . It seems the firmware has some last minute bugs in it related to the LAN connection . When the LAN cable is n't plugged in it behaves just fine , but when I put it in the darn thing locks up so tight that the only way to get control back is to unplug the power . The lock ups started on me when I took it out the box and was trying to get through the setup screens . I could get one screen done and it locks up . Cycling the power plug would let me get one screen past where I was the previous time and then it would lock up again . At first I thought it was the remote batteries or something to do with the HDMI cable or the LAN cable , but I 've swapped both those out and it consistently locks up . This beta mentality is inexcusable for a product that so heavily trumpets its network\/streaming capability . I guess I 'll have to await a firmware update and perform it via CDR and keep my fingers crossed that it fixes it . 	Blu Ray Player
I heard many great things about this player and really liked the features -LRB- wifi built-in with netflix , blockbuster , etc. . . compatibility -RRB- . It is my first blu-ray player . I had it connected in under 5 minutes . Wifi was a breeze . Netflix and pandora were streaming immediately . Overall , all of the features were working great and continued for the past week I have owned it . I finally got a blu-ray disc delivered and was eager to play it tonight . Initially , despite hitting the open\/eject button several times , the tray would not open . The screen would say it was opening , then loading , then no disc . but the tray never opened . I noticed there was an update available so figured this was causing the problem . I hit ` yes ' to start the update - which completed in about 5 minutes or less with no problem . I restarted the play and everything seems fine , but still the disc tray wo n't open . Too bad , everything else has been stellar . I guess it will be going back tomorrow and hopefully the replacement will actually open the tray -LRB- and everything else will work as with the first -RRB- . 	Blu Ray Player
I recently purchased this and it is an excellent 3D Blu Ray player . It came shipped with firmware 1.11 . Updating to version 1.56 via built-in wireless was very easy . Netflix and YouTube worked flawlessly . I have this connected to a Yamaha RX-V667 reciever then to a Panasonic TC-P50VT20 and second generation Panasonic 3D glasses . I played with the 2D to 3D conversion feature using Indiana Jones\/Crystal Skull DVD . It really works . Not as good effects as an actual movie formatted for 3D Blu Ray which is fantastic on this set-up -LRB- Avatar , Despicable Me , Alice in Wonderland , etc. -RRB- , but does provide good 3D depth and manual adjustments of settings do change the perspective . The touch sensor works quite well and is very handy . The player is located on shelf and usually dark . Very useful feature . I have a DMP-BD100 that came with the original set-up which is also quite good . I wanted to try the 2D-3D as well as the wireless connection so upgraded to the DMP-BD210 . Very happy with the decision . 	Blu Ray Player
So I 've had this player for two days now and have used it for Amazon Video , Netflix , The Lord of the Rings Trilogy , Terminator 2 : Skynet Edition , The Wizard of Oz , and Inception . But before any of that I upgraded to the newest firmware . The player has been absolutely flawless . No freezes , cutouts or issues like those expressed in many of the negative reviews . I could n't be more pleased so far . And yes , I knew the player was n't wifi equipped when I ordered . I had a wireless router in bridge mode ready to connect to its ethernet port before it got to me . For those who might be worried about the lack of a front panel display : I had a similar reservation . But I 've found I have n't needed a front display at all and there are no distracting lights or indicators operating during movies . And I 've actually managed to grow a brand new preference for this . You should n't hesitate to buy if you know exactly what you 're getting for the lower price and are technically adept when it comes to setting up an internet connection for the player .

After reading all the reviews on here I was pretty impressed so I decided to buy it after looking around . It does everything it says it does , works great . But I think some of the reviews on here are a little overboard ; it 's not the greatest thing on earth , it does the job . 	Blu Ray Player
Reading some of the reviews for this item , I feel as if I 'm the only one who got a good one ! Yes , setup with the 0-9 characters was kind of clunky but no problem if you 're paying attention to what you 're doing . Streaming Netflix has been great , close to HD quality with their HD selections . I have an MLB . tv subscription , and the Samsung app for that is laid out very nicely and simply . The only problems with that have been from the MLB website , not from the Blu-Ray player . Oh yeah , it 's a blu-ray player , too , and a terrific one ! Picture and audio quality are both top-notch , the best quality I have seen in the 5 players I have personally owned . Remote is easy to use , and I have nothing but good things to say about this item . A + on all levels . ADDED : When originally purchased , the HULU Plus app that was advertised on the outside of the box was not available , which was disappointing . After a recent update , the HULU Plus app is now available on this machine . A great item has just become that much better ! 	Blu Ray Player
Purchased this to start using Wi-Fi with existing TV . Very easy to set up and the interface is easy to use . Video quality is great using Wi-Fi and of course with Blu-ray discs . Wi-Fi video playback is not choppy . Highly recommend this player . 	Blu Ray Player
This unit is sleek , easy to set up and gives a great image . This is the 2nd unit we bought , you wo n't regret it ! 	Blu Ray Player
I love the blue ray player , but thought I would be able to stream right away . The description failed to tell me that a $ 76.00 wireless adapter would be needed for any connection to my wireless network . 	Blu Ray Player
I bought this product after purchasing a similar Visio WI-FI enabled blu-ray player at Walmart . This LG blu-ray player is very easy to use and has many useful features with the Homelink and Netcast apps . If you want a basic blu-ray player with enabled WI-FI for a good price this LG player fits the bill . I am considering purchasing this player a second time ! 	Blu Ray Player
I bought this basic BD player for my parents . I was not expecting any thrills or anything , just a player that could read and display good quality blu-rays and dvd 's on their Panny flat screen in 1080P . Being able to load quickly was also a requirement which it does very nicely . I did not care if it was wi-fi enabled as my parents would n't even use those features . With their aging eye sight , I do n't think they can tell the difference between SD and HD but whatever , at least I can enjoy watching some BD 's while I 'm over there at their house ... I could have bought a cheaper no name BD player but I wanted to make sure I got one that had quality `` resolution '' . For 78 bucks shipped you ca n't really go wrong . I think now it is down to $ 59 so even better . If all you are looking for is a basic stand alone BD player then this should do you fine . 	Blu Ray Player
I returned the first Panasonic DMP-BDT210 that was blanking out during setup and playback . The second one does the same except it does it only on 3D . I have a Sony Blu-Ray player that has no problems with the same setup . I am giving up on Panasonic Blu-Ray players and switching to some other brand for 3D player - maybe Sony . 	Blu Ray Player
I had reviewed earlier about how this player was trash . I have to apologize to Sony for that . After spending more time looking at the problem , it is apparent something is seriously wrong with my Toshiba TV . It 's just hard to believe all the inputs , with the exception of the off-air antennae , are trashed . Oh well . Apologizes to Sony and its Malaysian work force . : -RRB- 	Blu Ray Player
LG BD570 has been by far the best player I 've ever owned . Very impressed . It plays the movies off YouTube and some other tv programs for FREE . So even if I do not have any paid subscription , I still have lots of programs to watch . I am glad I bought it . Last year , it was around $ 300 . This year it is selling at less than half the price . My recommended improvements would be - having an additional USB port at the back so I plug in the laptop 2.5 '' hard drive it wo n't be seen . - an internet browser app \*\*\* UPDATE after 3 months of ownership \*\*\* I bought the LG570 in Nov 2010 and it has been having issues with the sound . While the movies are playing on Netflix or DVD , the sound suddenly turns off while the picture continues to play . This happens 1 out of 7 times . Even if I stop the movie and play it back , it does not resolve the issue . I have to switch off the player and then turn it back on to play the movie to resolve the sound issue . It gets irritating due to the frequency of its occurrence . Not sure what can be done to resolve it permanently . 	Blu Ray Player
other than just repeating the glowing reviews for this remarkable machine , i would simply say that based on the way the product was packed and the inclusion of cables and other hardware and the completeness of the instruction manual , this OPPO company truly loves what they 're doing . most other electronic corporations could take a hint from OPPO and show a little love to their customers . for $ 500.00 this player is an absolute bargain ! 	Blu Ray Player
Overall the product is fine . Pandora is great as is DVD playback . The only two issues we have had with it was that on the box it indicated it was WiFi ready . In reality , you have to buy a $ 50 adapter . Good news is that there is an ethernet port to connect directly to the router in the back of the player so it all worked out ok . The other issue that we have had is extremely annoying . When we watch programs on Netflix the video feed will suddenly cut out and it will try to re-buffer . Occasionally it will re-buffer and proceed . This is rare . What is far more common is that we have to turn the player off then back on again , go through the process of logging on , restarting the program and hope that we can finish our program without further interruption . Typically this issue crops up in the last few seconds of a movie or of a show , prior to credits rolling . This means we may miss the last few minutes to last few seconds of dialogue which , in the case of TV programs , means we have to spend 5 minutes getting back to our show to hear the last 3 seconds of audio so that we are clued into what the resolution was . Phenomenally aggravating . It is worth mentioning that we are currently stuck using DSL through Verizon -LRB- overpriced at ~ $ 40\/month , intermittent , not to mention far slower than the claimed speed-normally we get perhaps a third of the claimed speed and never do we reach more than half . As soon as we can get internet from some other company we are dropping Verizon -RRB- . We just found out where we live will be getting cable run in through Comcast and we are excited to switch over . We hope this fixes our problem . Otherwise we are going to have to get a new machine . In conclusion , apart from the Netflix issue the player works great -LRB- Pandora , accuweather , DVD player , etc -RRB- . Also , the ability to load music onto a USB drive and plug it in and then play that music for a party or something of that nature has been pretty handy . -LRB- Edit -RRB- We have since tried to subscribe to HuluPlus . Apparently , Samsung in all of its wisdom has decided that non-3d players will not be able to use HuluPlus and they do not foresee us being able to at any time even though they originally said it would be available . Additionally , at one time we had the HuluPlus app on the DVD player but at that time were not interested in it . Samsung deleted the app via one of their required updates . I would avoid this company at all costs in the future . I am changing the rating that I originally gave this product from a 3\/5 to 1\/5 . I will never purchase a Samsung product ever again .

I had a Samsung BluRay player the lasted a grand total of 1 year and 1 month before locked up and refused to respond . Googling revealed that the problem was common and there is no fix . Researching a replacement led me to the LG 590 . The USB and network support has exceeded my expectations , along with the wide range of codecs supported . There was a snag when the remote failed after a few hours . a call to LG 's support had them agreeing the remote was defected . They put a replacement in the mail but it will take ~ 10 days to arrive . In the interim I acquired a Logitech Harmony 300 which controls the device beautifully . I doubt I 'll use the replacement when it arrives . I have to say the Samsung dying was the best thing to happen to my setup . I 'm extremely pleased with the LG . 	Blu Ray Player
I wanted a blu-ray player for the bedroom since I have a PS3 in the living room and with this unit I got that and more . I did n't even realize how wonderful it would be to have the ability to stream netflix and my own music to it . I am also very impressed with Vudu . Not only did it come with 1 free rental but that rental streamed at a full 1080P and the picture was flawless and never buffered or anything . The funny thing is that I have yet to actually play a blu-ray in this thing because I find all the other features to be so much more useful so far . The built-in wifi was a must for me and I do not regret paying a little extra for that . I do have a wireless-N network and that helps . My bedroom TV is a Sanyo and that is the only downside - wish I had bought an LG TV for the bedroom because when I did plug this player into my LG TV in the living room I was able to use one remote for everything . The remote that does come with this player is very nice but is not able to control my Sanyo TV and has very limited support for other TV 's which is the only strike against it but not enough to remove a star in my opinion . I am recommending this to a co-worker as well . Do n't hesitate on this one , just buy it ! 	Blu Ray Player
This bluray player has great bluray picture quality , but one of the most glaring problems with this player has to do with netflix streaming . Every few minutes , a series of black screen flash during your movie . It happens despite a good wifi signal and ruins the moviegoing experience . Its too bad Panasonic did n't test this player enough to detect this problem . As a result , I returned the player to Amazon . Apparently , Panasonic 's new BDT220 player has this netflix problem resolved so I 'm considering getting that model . But since its still new , I 'm going to wait a while to make sure its really fixed . The other thing that I hated about the 210 was the terribly slow and ugly viera cast interface . Apparently they still have n't fixed this with the 220 model . Anyhows , if you decide to get this player , be aware of the black flashing problem with netflix . 	Blu Ray Player
I 'm not a tech person at all so I do n't have the expertise to critique this player with a fine tooth comb . My husband and I just wanted a player that would give us the option of watching Netflix and playing Pandora radio , as well as watching blu ray movies . I have a Macbook Pro laptop and some reviews said that this player was not compatible with Mac , but I also read troubleshooting suggestions on some of the Mac forums . I doubt if I will ever use my computer with it , so that did n't matter that much to me . If I change my mind I can always try the trouble shooting advice from the Mac heads online . I bought this player from Crutchfield for $ 139 . I hooked it up via hdmi . It found the internet immediately and within minutes we were watching Netflix after going to the netflix site as per instructed and entering a code . The setup was the easiest electronic experience I have ever witnessed . In my mid 50s I missed the technology boat , so that is saying a lot ! In fact , I was surprised because I did not know that it was wifi ready and was expecting to have to use a dongle with it . Too bad my tv is not the same technology , but now I probably wo n't even bother connecting my internet ready tv to the internet since I can get netflix and pandora through the player . -LRB- plus more that I do n't care about -RRB- By the way I have an old Belkin G router and it 's working perfectly other than being a tad slower than what an N router might be , but I can wait 30 or 40 seconds for a movie to load . The streaming has been flawless . I have Comcast highest speed internet package . I do n't know how this player does it , but it adjusts the picture -LRB- color\/contrast\/etc -RRB- so that it 's gorgeously perfect . This player adjusted our BD tv to perfection . Our jaws were dropping . So much better than our cable company . Probably the best $ 139 I 've spent . Ca n't wait to order some blu rays from Netflix . We did watch one -LRB- Hot Tub -RRB- which was fantastic picture but awful movie . 	Blu Ray Player
I have to give this player 4 stars instead of 5 because it is missing too many things . Let me start off with the good stuff : PROS : 1 . Solid hardware \/ software - user inferface is sleek and fast enough except when you get to vierra cast which is slow especially at nigh . I had a samsung and i had to return it becuase the user interface was so sluggish and looked horrible . This player has a good look\/feel to it when browsing around . 2 . detects my server without any problems . 3 . Supports VUDU , Netflix , skype , etc. . CONS : 1 . Vierra CAST loads slow at night time , Very sluggish and annoying . This is the interface that loads all your internet apps . On several occasions I had to wait about 1 minute before it loaded . I have high speed internet from time Warner so I know its their servers . Also , this only happens at night . 2 . Cant download apps like the other players -LRB- samusng , lg , etc. -RRB- You are basically stuck with too few online apps from vierra Cast . Cant watch news or anything like that with this . 3 . Too many of my music cant be streamed . They need to update the player to play more of the popular file formats . The Samsung player I returned was able to play all of my media music files . I am seriously thinking about returning this and going with the LG instead as their players has much better support for audio files . I have an synology server and I am not even able to stream radio stations from the server over this player . The Samsung player streamed all my radio stations without any problems but was just too buggy for my taste . All these cons can easily be fixed by an update from panasonic but I doubt that will be happening anytime soon . So I will return this player to bestbuy and go with an LG player . I dont use bluray disks that much so i really dont care so much for fast disk load feature that this player has . 	Blu Ray Player
I was reluctant to purchase this model due to the number of negative reviews , but I have been extremely pleased after about two months of use . I bought it to play Blu ray on our new Samsung 46 '' and so far it has performed flawlessly . I used HDMI for the connection and it automatically turns the TV on -LRB- but not off -RRB- . It enhances standard DVDs and they look great on the HD screen . The markings are difficult to read on the front of the unit , but the remote is well organized and easy to use . I have not set up the Netflix link , so I can not comment on that feature . I have been using Blockbuster Express and have never had a disc rejected -LRB- and some of them look pretty beat up ! -RRB- I feel that the DMP-BD75 is an excellent value ... I would recommend it to a friend . UPDATE : I just purchased a second unit to use with our bedroom TV . -LRB- $ 30 cheaper than original purchase ! -RRB- 	Blu Ray Player
After first leaving a GLOWING review of this product , I 'm changing my mind . The software updates are horrible ! Last one blew out the `` Home Link '' feature , so I can no longer share files with my PC -LRB- ie : created a jukebox of all my saved music -RRB- . This DID work before . Also , after the `` upgrade ?? '' certain Blu Ray movies will not even play !! Black Swan is one of them . Mind you , this played fine before the upgrade . Calling their tech support is like going to war w \/ India ... ... no help . I wanted to take the last upgrade off ? A disc must be sent from the factory . You can not download the older version online -LRB- stupid -RRB- and it takes many weeks to receive the disc . Explained that i wanted the player removed or replaced since it is still under warranty ... I was placed on perma-hold 2 times , then hung up on !!! Come on , LG !!! Have been on the line with tech support for over 10 hours if added up . CRAZY !!!! 	Blu Ray Player
This product from Samsung is amazing . The boot up time take some time and especially if you have anytime active , it keeps searching and alternate between reading disk and not found . However the product is very very sleek and elegant . Online applications are excellent . But i was not able to set up the software on my Windows 7 to sync the music and videos from my laptop to TV . Site said that there is no software for Windows 7 . I am a little disappointed and will keep looking for updates . But would definitely recommend this product 	Blu Ray Player
Yes it is pretty , yes it worked fine when purchased a few weeks ago , but when opening day for Baseball is here , LG is in bed having a siesta . Everyone who bought LG TV 's or Blu Ray players with the expectation of watching MLB baseball is screwed . Then LG provides a software update that killed every one using wireless . The only response is that it could be several days before LG has a fix . Have to recommend a different brand to anyone thinking of buying . If they ca n't fix a problem like this for several days , what else will it be in the future ? 	Blu Ray Player
Bought the Oppo for 7.1 channel output connection to an older Denon receiver without HDMI to get DTS-HD audio . The Oppo allowed for adjusting speaker level and distance which is bypassed in the Denon when using the 7.1 external inputs . Sound is fantastic . 	Blu Ray Player
As yet I have had no problems with this player . I have several British and Russian DVDs which play as well as region 1 discs . Blu-Ray 's load quickly . When I put in a disc that I had played partially several days before , and I had played various other films in the interim , it automatically opened at the point where I had paused it . My only complaint is that the owner 's manual is rather small . 	Blu Ray Player
I bought a Panasonic Blue Ray Player . The manual states the box contained the HDMI cable . After several time consuming telephone calls , third rep said my model did n't contain that cable . The first two reps said the cable would be sent right out . After waiting for a period of time the third rep said no cable . 	Blu Ray Player
BluRay playback , audio and video are incredible . I see and hear things I never notice before in my favorite movies ... And that 's kinda where the hoopla and fanfare ends with this player : Using HDMI the output ` glitches ' and the TV re-recognizes the input as active . The player messes up interlacing of the first few frames of a new clip or scene . Upscaling on DVDs scrolling text or frozen pictures show jaggy edges , very ugly . I let my TV do the upscaling , it 's waaaay better than the S370 . The firmware onboard was old , I upgraded the day I got it . That was a +50 Mb download - not for dial-up or users ! It was easy enough to burn the CD and the player upgraded . I have n't had a try of streaming or DNLA yet . No interest in 3D , wanted SACD player , intreagued by the DNLA possibilities and I was on a tight budget . It was this or an Oppo . The S370 won out ... for now . I might still return it and upgrade . Update : Had this player a year , still have it . I 'm still itching to upgrade but it is so capable in every other area that I have no solid reason to .

Would buy again , I now have 2 of these . They both work great and are easy to use ! 	Blu Ray Player
After about 90 days and the latest firmware Netflix has just stopped working . Wish I could return it . Search google for Panasonic Blu-ray players having Netflix issues ? and you will find an article on CNET about this . 	Blu Ray Player
This is , without a doubt , the worst electronic device I 've ever purchased . The menus are primitive and the navigation is incredibly slow . I 'm talking building the Giza pyramids kind of slow . The internet connection is shoddy at best and I regularly have to restart the machine -LRB- usually multiple times -RRB- in order to get a connection -LRB- and it 's not even a wifi connection ! -RRB- . The button layout on the remote control is worse than a rich mother-in-law . The remote makes it all too easy to accidentally press a wrong button and exit out of Netflix that you just waited 10 minutes to load . It 's loud . Really loud . The power and eject buttons are on the top of the player which is really dumb and more of a pain that you 'd think . Even RCA makes better electronics than this piece of junk . 	Blu Ray Player
I got this to replace an old Sammy Blu-Ray that was no longer being updated . It is indeed a very fast loader , the picture is great , it does do 1080p 24 fps , so as a disc player it is great . The online features pretty much suck however . Netflix exhibits the dreaded and much discussed `` black flashes '' and it often loses contact with Amazon VOD . It pretty much drives you nuts . Here is the thing - it IS the player causing this , not my connection or anything else . I also have an HTPC sitting right next to this unit and plugged into the same Ethernet switch so it uses the exact same internet connection . I can have endless trouble streaming on this unit and then switch over to my HTPC and a browser and watch the exact same program from the exact same service with no glitches whatever . I suspect they have too little buffer memory due to a desire to make a less expensive unit and it just can not handle ups and downs in the stream whereas the PC which has virtually unlimited buffer size , can do so easily . If you want a disc player , good choice , if you want a streaming box , find something else . 	Blu Ray Player
The Internet connectivity is sporadic . It wo n't play a lot of blu rays . Hate it . Waste of money . Netflix freezes all the time . The problem is not my connection . I 'm using a wired connection with 20mb down . Do n't buy this garbage . 	Blu Ray Player
I have a PS3 and was on the fence on whether I wanted to take the plunge and get this because of the mixed comments from various websites . The upgrade may not benefit some but for my set up it made a big difference . I have 50 inch Panasonic G 30 Plasma TV Marantz SR6006 And Mirage 7.1 Surround with the OMD 15 , 1 , and 5 speakers The picture quality is noticeably better and the Oppo also gives an option to set your output closer to the Disc encoding of 4:2:0 with 4:2:2 which if you have a good dynamic range on your TV then while the difference it is not huge you will be able to notice a difference when you recalibrate your TV if you have a good calibration Disc . The audio however is where the Oppo shines . The Audio processing is much cleaner and when used in Multi channel in mode my receiver has a much fuller sound on all 7 channels than with the PS3 . . You also have the option of maintaining the full 7.1 surround without losing much in the process of movie titles that are 5.1 native . The only downside that I have is that my Receiver is not able to take full advantage of the Oppo because Marantz stopped decoding DSD of SACD disc on their newer receivers so I am stuck with lack luster 88khz sound from LPCM . Not the fault of the player however because if you have a receiver capable of accepting the full spectrum of DSD then I am sure it will sound amazing . After getting the Oppo I can say that it was worth the Upgrade for me . The picture quality is much better and the sound is on a completely different level . 	Blu Ray Player
The color of the illuminated ring around the dial is selectable : seven fixed colors , including three shades of blue , two of green , one each of red and violet ; also , my favorite option , is to have the color vary -LRB- never does red though -RRB- ; the illumination can also be powered off . The set has a nice weight -LRB- it is n't light -RRB- and feel , like it is a quality piece of equipment . However , the bass is boomy out of the box and there are no tone controls . I corrected the boominess by partially blocking the bass reflex ports with tissue -- audio enthusiasts will know how to do this -LRB- do n't try otherwise -RRB- -- sound quality out of the box should be fine for non-enthusiasts . Overall , I love this set . 	CDPlayer
I just recently got this player , and it is wonderful . I agree with many of the positive and negative points that many reviewers have already stated . I figured I would add my own list of likes and dislikes , to help future shoppers . What I was looking for when I was looking for a player was mainly an MP3 audio book player . I have CDs with several tracks , each running between 1 and 2 hours long . Here are the features I likes : ability to stop , and then resume where is left off ; playlist support -LRB- up to two -RRB- ; and ID3 tag display . I also like the built in functions for browsing the songs you have on the CD . You can even browse while a track is playing . All in all , the design of the player feels well thought out . I got this very cheap cassette player , and it implements all the features it says it has , but just barely . There are all sorts of quirks that make it difficult to use . Not this player ; there are all sorts of quirks which make this player to use . There is one weakpoint , for me , with this player , and that is the speed of the fastforward . It 's a perfect speed for regular music playing -LRB- 5 min songs -RRB- , but if you want to fast forward in a 2 hour talk , its slow . O well , ca n't have eveything . 	CDPlayer

Within four months of purchase one of the cassette decks stopped working . No matter how much I try to adjust the sound , it is never clear . This was a great disappointment . 	CDPlayer
I 've had this player for 6 months and not had any problems AT ALL . I feel I 've already got my money 's worth . I mean for $ 40 , what more can you ask for than it playing everytime , never skipping , never freezing , NEVER overheating . It does n't have all the ridiculous features that a $ 200 Sony does , but how often do you use automatic frame locking . -LRB- This is where you can program it to pause on a certain scene -RRB- Who needs that ? Anyway , for the one blaming Amazon . You 're stupid if you do n't buy from Amazon anymore because of your experience with this player . Who knows what your daughter did to it within the two weeks she had it . Amazon ca n't be responsible for that . The manufacturer should be , and would if you would just contact them and keep on it . To that reviewer , you 're an idiot ! 	CDPlayer
I 've had numerous walkmans and this is the best . Yes the battery compartment is in a ridiculous place , and the batteries are hard to get out because the cover does n't open enough to give you easy access , but everything else is so perfect that it is worth the effort . This is the only player I 've had that does n't skip . It is great for reading books because it starts up just where you left off and the batteries last longer than any other players . So , all in all , it 's a winner . 	CDPlayer
The description states that it will play re-recordable CD 's and was one of the reasons that I bought it , unfortunately it WO N'T . I ended up paying for not for great speakers for my iPOD . I would not buy this product again 	CDPlayer
I ordered this to play my Ipod in my car . It is great and easy to use . The only down side , there is a faint noise that comes from the tape player but you have to have the sound turned all the way down on the audio . 	CDPlayer
Sony 's latest portable CD\/AM\/FM \/ TV\/WB walkman is a nice player . The sound on the unit is very good , tough not quite as good as Panasonic 's . It has 2 equalizers , while may CD players out today have 3 . The design is below average . The buttons are poorly placed , and button are hard to find and memorize . The CD player is very slim , which is a plus . Also , the CD player is sturdy and has good construction , as most Sony products . There are many features , such as AM radio , FM radio , TV , and Weatherband , but there is no MP3 feature , which is a big minus . The player does come with a remote , but only very basic features are on it , like play , stop , pause , back , and next . There is a hold button on the CD player and remote . The cost is way overpriced . Most players at this price range have MP3 , and have better sound . Overall , the DFJ200 is a flawed and overpriced CD player . Not recommended . 	CDPlayer
40 seconds shock protection , with Casio quality at -LRB- dollar amount -RRB- ! This is the best buy for coming gift season , best buy model . 	CDPlayer
I got it around two months ago and its great , exept the headphones the sound stpped coming out of them a few weeks ago , so I use my walkman headphones . The discmans performance is perfect andthats what counts . The options are great the groove is a little to bassy for me but that does n't mean everyone . As for battery life with ESP always on its fair , without ESP its great . I love it and i reccomend it to aanyone who wants this kind of audio . 	CDPlayer
I tried 3 different radios - Bose , Boston acoustics and Teac . For the price I liked the Teac best . I liked the fact it had controls on the radio plus the remote . The sound was as good as the others and you could select a talk radio control . The thing that bugs me most about these radios , especially the Teac , is that the light is so bright that it lights up the room when you are trying to sleep . They have alarm clocks so you would think they might be used in a bedroom . I wrote Teac and asked if a technician could get rid of the light but they did not bother to answer . 	CDPlayer
Truth is I really didnt need all the features . I just needed something to wake me or if I roll over before the alarm goes off tell me how much time i have till it does . For me at least the display is impossible to read and so I wear my watch to bed . Otherwise its a nice looking unit that appears well made . I 'll keep looking for that perfect Alarm and this one will find its way into the closet . 	CDPlayer
The cd player is inexpensive and it does its job for normal listening . Since it 's cheap , there is not any cd skip protection so joggers look elsewhere . Also , the buttons are n't that sensitive so you have to press them firmly . Other than that , you get your money 's worth . 	CDPlayer
I bought this to play CDs in my 2 year old daughter 's room . She does n't have much space so I was looking for something small that would still do the job . After reading the reviews on this radio\/CD player , I decided to try it . It 's got great sound and is perfect for the space she has . Now we can play CDs while we play and she can have her lullabies to go to sleep to . 	CDPlayer
Update October 28 , 2010 . Just received a gift of the product with which I had the problem from Tronics International Company . It is a nice touch and greatly appreciated . However , the same flyer was still in the package , and although I can not be sure that the phone numer is the same , I fear the same problem may occur . It is a nice product and seems at a fair price . I just might give Shoptronics another chance . I was relly excited to receive this boombox exactly on time . Looked great and radio was fine . CD player did not work at all . Big yellow paper came with it that said in huge letters `` IMPORTANT ! PLEASE READ If you have any questions or concerns with this product call toll free Monday - Friday -LRB- 8:00 am - 8:00 pm EST -RRB- 1-800-663-5954 PLEASE DO NOT RETURN THIS PRODUCT TO THE RETAIL LOCATION BEFORE CONTACTING CUSTOMER SERVICE .

They say they would have taken care of it for me . However , the large yellow flyer with the above message left little choice of who to call . The problem I had was the probglem I had , and believe that Shoptronics should better identify how to reach them . They may stand behind what they sell , but there was nothing in the package to tell how to reach them . Perhaps I should have searched for the actual seller , but was kind of bummed by the person who answered the call . Maybe it was just this one product , but it sure was an unhappy situation .

This is the best present you could ever get . The sound is awasome , it works great and is easy to operate . 	CDPlayer
The item , Sylvania Portable CD Player with AM \/ \/ FA radio , was the perfect gift for my granddaughter . It was everything I hoped it would be and she was thrilled with it . It came very quickly and I was very happy with the dealer . 	CDPlayer
I was a dedicated Target fan but his ruined it for me . Ordered the first one , volume was either blasting loud or super soft . Still not unhappy , just thought it was a one in a million thing . Ordered a replacement . Guess what , volume did n't work on this one either . Still not unhappy . Decided it would be best just to get a refund and start all over on my search for a cd player . 	CDPlayer
Burning CDs in this machine is quite easy . Just read the instructions and you cant go wrong . The CDs sound just equal to the original . However , i am shocked with the quality sound of this machine in play back . It is a real huge improvement over my top rated X brand cd player . 	CDPlayer
I just bought this CD player , liking the TV and WB features . I had a D-F200 , pretty much the same thing as this , except minus the TV and WB functions . I had beat it up pretty bad , so I bought a new one . This one looks sturdier . There are 2 lid hooks , as opposed to 1 , which I liked , having there being almost no chance of it opening up on a drop like my old one . Although the buttons are a bit small on the actual unit , the remote is a nice secondary control - great for nighttime listening . Excellent sound for CD playing . Superb reception overall for most stations . One complaint though , I am having trouble receiving any Weatherbands . Are these for certain areas or times ? I have no clue . O well , I guess that is what the radio is for . I recommend this CD Player for anyone looking for that snazzle little feature , TV reception . I like it , and I bet you will too . 	CDPlayer
No remote control -LRB- for muting the device from across the room when the phone rings -RRB- and no returns -LRB- once I realized no remote control -RRB- . The controls are fairly complicated ... in fact , finding the Power button takes a bit of scanning as it is an obscure switch in the middle of many other switches . Not intuitive ... and also not returnable . Not recommended unless you a desperate . Tuner is satisfactory and speakers are OK -LRB- presuming you do n't want concert quality -RRB- . 	CDPlayer
Great looking product at a fantastic price ... but , sound quality is just ` ok ' , and , when in ` CD ' mode , it has an annoying hum if nothing is playing or if the volume is low . Also - my 19 month old son was able to snap the antenna off in a matter of seconds ... you get what you pay for ! I am extremely disappointed & will not be buying another Coby anytime soon ! 	CDPlayer
The unit failed after around 9 months of light use . It basically froze up and would n't play , eject or respond to any commands . Sent it back for repair under warranty and did n't receive it back for 3 months . Worked ok for maybe 10 hours of use , now failed again . Wo n't even power on . I give up and will order a Marantz CC4001 . 	CDPlayer
I 'd only add memory to the radio . Other than that everything works perfectly . The SD card sounds great , as well as the USB port . Very glad with this product . 	CDPlayer
I have proven other models also of Panasonic in the past and all have operated perfectly , however the design of the screen and the buttons of this new model make it better to the anterior , also the sound is amazing . I have utilized it in my car and the disk has never skipped . Just Buy It . 	CDPlayer
Ordered for my daughter 's room . We use it during playtime . It is small and compact , has decent sound -LRB- we keep things low -RRB- , and works well . I 'd order it again . 	CDPlayer
Does n't sound very well . The fact that it has the line in is pretty cool . But what do you expect for $ 30.00 . 	CDPlayer
IF YOU ARE INTO MUSIC FROM CDS AND THE SOUND QUALITY IS VERY IMPORTANT TO YOU THIS IS THE UNIT TO GET . . NO ELECTRONIC MUSIC PROCESSOR OR ARTIFICIAL CRAP JUST PURE AUDIOPHILE QUALITY SOUND . . THE WAY MUSIC SHOULD SOUND ... HIGHLY RECOMMENDED ESPECIALLY NEW GENERATION . 	CDPlayer
I bought this unit as a gift for my Mom because she moved into a tiny apartment . It worked and sounded great for such a small stereo . It lasted for two years . The cd player will play a song then not have any sound or stop playing altogether . Radio works fine . You would think it would have lasted much longer . Never had a cd player do that in such a short time . I wo n't buy the same brand again . 	CDPlayer
I received this item in January with a base that had no top to it . The cabinet was damaged ; when I eventually tried to use the CD component , the CD would not open . The base also did not match the oak finish on the phonograph . In March at the cost of $ 130 I returned this product . A month later , Amazon did credit me with the original cost . However , no one has accepted reponsibility for the high cost of packing and shipping a bulky product across the country . At the moment , I have no phonograph , nor would I want one from Kaito , and I am out $ 130 for returning a defective product . I urge consumers to avoid doing business with this firm . It is the only bad experience I have had in using Amazon for several years . 	CDPlayer
I had done a fair amount of boombox hunting -LRB- which , I know , sounds silly -RRB- but thought that this machine was the answer to my quest . It has an auxiliary input and can handle mp3 player inputs as well as CD and radio . It is on the better end of sound quality for boomboxes . But it has a major problem . I bought it to be a CD player , and the CD reader seems to be degenerating after only about 4 or 5 months of faithful work . I have cleaned it a couple times and tried it on multiple CDs , but its acting like a very old player , either failing to read disks or skipping . 	CDPlayer
It 's perfect for `` small '' use . A boombox this cheap is not to be used as your wedding music !!! It 's a small , medium quality boombox . And it 's perfect to have it in my kids ' rooms . We play a background noise CD on it and it 's perfect at night , and fun kids CD during the day . It 's very small so does n't take much space on the desk or chest in their rooms . We 've owned it for a couple of days only , so I do n't know that it will die on me in a few weeks , like some other reviews have mentioned . So far so good , and we 're all liking it very much . 	CDPlayer
This CD player Rocks ! The anti skip is excelent , It looks cool2 . Except for the fact tthat the headphones are dorky . 	CDPlayer
This player came in a plastic clam shell I had to cut open , but that was fine . It was in perfect condition and came in less than 24 hours with my Prime membership . Of course , the headphones that came with it are a joke , not really meant to be used . They should just save the money and NOT include this junk . I also purchased JBud J4 in ear ear buds that are spectacular ! The player plays well . It seems delicate . The battery compartment with 2aa batteries is actually inside under where you place the disc . That 's not terrible , but the door , as another reviewer mentioned , is VERY delicate . It seems like if you were not paying extreme attention it would break or the spring inside the battery compartment would . I would also be careful taking the disk off the spindle . I have not moved it much except it slipped into my recliner and stopped for a second , but picked up with the anti skip , exactly where it was when it slipped , it did not hit the floor . I do not plan to take it out of the house since I just needed it to play some disks that ca n't be transferred to computer or MP3 , so it will remain just by my bed for bedtime music never moving from there . I can not speak for it in backpacks . It says in the instructions you can lock controls , which is a slide flat lever on the back of the unit . It shows a little lock on the display when this is engaged . It is not fancy , does not play MP3s but has a program function to play certain tracks . I only wanted a simple player since I have a fancy MP3 player for the other stuff . It is straightforward and really simple to use for the technology challenged . I think the sound is just fine with my headphones and my husband agreed as he is a musician and composer of guitar and piano . He said the frequency stuff in the player can be a factor so it is NOT just the headphones I have that makes it an acceptable player . I like the different settings for the equalizer for rock , pop , and Surround sound and I can tell the difference . I was listening to jazz with lots of sax and horns and it seemed nice and clear for bass and treble also . So overall the player is acceptable for just normal use , no jogging or hard usage or breakage yet . I will update if it breaks next week ! So far so good . 	CDPlayer
I purchased this CD player for my teenager and found out it was a great player !! For being an RCA , it really surprised me how good it was . RCA has n't had a good product base in the past , and I was shy of buying this for that fact , but this model is great !! 	CDPlayer
If you still like to listen to cds I would certainly recommend the RCA Personal CD player with FM Radio . It is good for listening to all of your favorite cds as well as FM radio . The price is not bad as well . 	CDPlayer
It was hard to open , and get started . It 's also difficult to turn off . Have to keep pushing the batteries down , they keep popping up . Very , very disappointed The sad thing is I bought two . My daughter is having the same problems . Even bought new ear phones too . 	CDPlayer
This radio is well worth what I paid . I did n't think to check on cord storage when I made the purchase . This style does n't have cord storage and the cord has already come up missing once . The cord detaches easily . 	CDPlayer
I liked the price of this under cabinet clock radio . Good sound quality but no option to preset stations . It has a dial on the side for setting the stations which makes switching from AM to FM strange . It remembers the AM dial setting location when you switch it to FM the dial stays in the same place causing the FM station to be off . The stations are sometimes tough to pin down . For example , AM 690 displays as AM 685 to AM 692 . Weird . For limited use , it 's a good value for the money and it was easy to install . I would recommend it for a an inexpensive alternative to the $ 100 + models . 	CDPlayer
very Bad quality , does work good at all , i returned because the sound was awful at all , its weird because i have been using Coby for a long time , and never been like this one 	CDPlayer
STUFF I LIKED : 1 -RRB- it has a radio ! its awesome , so that if you get bored of CDs , theres always the radio there to listen to . reception was decent from where i was ... some stations better than others . it even partially worked for a while underground in the subway lol . 2 -RRB- sound quality in general is perfectly fine . it has enough options - the basics , play stop pause skip etc , and some program song things and random shuffle , intro , repeat , repeat all . im not that into hi tech stuff , so maybe to other people who are used to all sorts offancy buttons this may be a disappointment , but it was perfectly fine for me , perfectly servicable and adequate . 3 -RRB- great anti-skip thing -45 seconds . it hasnt skipped at all so far with the antishock thing on , even running a bit . and you even have the option to turn it off if you want . pretty cool . 4 -RRB- it has a `` low battery '' display thing to warn you . <p> THINGS I DIDNT LIKE : 1 -RRB- the buttons are easy to reach cuz theyre in the front , but then if you try to put the discman in a bag or something the buttons get pressed by other things easily , so its best to just hold it in your hand which is kind of annoying . but thats just a minor thing 2 -RRB- its rather on the bulky side , especially compared to super expensive new ultra slim models . its a tight fit into a really big jacket pocket . but its okay though . 3 -RRB- personally i like the behind the ear headphones or earbuds or something , but this is traditional over your head earphones . theyre good quality though , the volume is fine , music doesnt get warped , perfectly servicable once again . it doesnt block out outside noise at ALL though , which can be annoying -LRB- especially on the subway -RRB- . but theyre decent 4 -RRB- sort of short battery life ... my first set of new batteries got eaten up in about 6-7 hours ... i dont know if thats considered good or bad , but ive heard of other discmans having battery lives of like 30 hours and such . <p> so overall , a really great buy ... very affordable especially for all its features and stuff . i shopped around a lot before choosing this cd player , and im happy with my decision . \*\*\*\* EDITED FROM ABOUT A YEAR LATER \*\*\*\* okay , above was my review after owning this CD player for about a month . a year later , I realize it probably was n't the best investment ever . - It does have a sort of bulky cheap plastic feel to it , and after dropping it a few times -LRB- which i think is somewhat inevitable throughout the course of a year ... -RRB- , the clasp broke off , so now I use a big piece of duct tape to keep the cd player shut . That 's fine though , it still works . - The big easy-to-push buttons are still really annoying , so I always take the batteries out when putting the player into my bag . - the anti-skip feature stopped working well . When I run , I just listen to the radio , because now the feature only lets me listen to 45 seconds of CD music before it starts skipping with a vengeance . Since I plan to run for more than 45 seconds , the feature is rather useless for running purposes , but still decent for bumpy busrides or just walking . The radio is still fine after a year . - The display has gone kaput . You can still see the minutes , but the little lines that make up the numbers for the seconds have disappeared one by one throughout the year . So overall , probably not the best buy , especially for durability , but it still works sort of , and I am somewhat attached to it despite its shortcomings . 	CDPlayer
This cd player works great at a very affordable price . The item came brand new and works perfectly . It does not have repeat or hold as advertised but the 60 second skip function works great . You could shake this cd player yourself and the music would n't skip a bit . 	CDPlayer
-LRB- -LRB- ASIN : B000CBB4N4 Coby Personal CD Player with Stereo Headphones CXCD109BLK , Black -RRB- Imagine hearing this : `` Now is the time '' -LRB- wait 10 seconds -RRB- `` for all good men to come '' -LRB- wait 5 seconds -RRB- `` to the aid of their country . '' This product has never worked . It first played intermittently , so I thought there might be something wrong with the earphones . After switching earphones , the problem persisted . Now it does n't work at all . I have owned this CD player for 7-8 days and used it for about 2 hours total . Complete waste of money . 	CDPlayer
I really liked this player until it just stopped working ! The CD just spins and does n't play ... 	CDPlayer
I like this better than my TiVO . And it is as easy to use . I just plugged it in & started using it . 	CDPlayer
Nice looking , great sound , good headset , anti-skip works great . I walk everyday and this unit bounces inside my coat pocket or backpack without a skip . Sometimes I jog a little - still no problem . <p> However - the designers did n't use it like I do : It needs a belt clip - geez , pretty basic - or at least a carrier of some sort . <p> AND , the control button array is on top and I 've found it will turn on if bumped when setting my backpack down . The result is a battery drain . <p> Finally , the headset plug goes into the side of the unit ruining the narrow width and sleek design . It wo n't slide into most pockets as a result . They should put the protruding plug along the front or back edge , not the widest , side edge . 	CDPlayer
Plays fine ... needs a shoulder strap or some such apparatus ... controls and battery installation awkward and difficult to access ... low contrast on controls so who knows what button is pushed in what direction ... price very reasonable for the quality of the sound ... I own it , but would not choose it again 	CDPlayer
I 've had my 250 for about 3 months and I love most everything about it . BUT there are a few problems I 'm having with the MP3 discs I 'm making . If you burn a MP3 CD with more than 255 tracks -LRB- think audiobooks at 64kbps -RRB- and you create a playlist to make sure you hear it in order the player will stop after the 255th track . Not a major problem I 'll admit but I drive cross-country a lot and I was hoping to cut down my CD luggage when traveling . The other problem is when you fill a 700MB CDR -LRB- any brand -- I 've tried 6 different -RRB- and use a playlist the player will not even boot up -- It just goes back to the POWER ON screen and stays there unless you go to the radio . The player has worked well other than these 2 prob 's -- Sounds Great\/Works Great with Audio CD 's and the separate Line Out jack is great for plugging into my home stereo . I 've heard customer support is in the toilet but until it stops working completely , I 'm cool 	CDPlayer
This stereo arrived in two days with the amazing amazon prime promise , but unfortunately the CD player did n't work . We returned this immediately with no hassles . 	CDPlayer
This little jewel works GREAT >> >> -RRB- BUT I wish I had purchased one with a combination cd\/vhs but live and learn Besides that $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ was a factor so I had to go with this 	CDPlayer
If you want to relax yourself to sleep with a cd and wake up to both a buzz and a radio -LRB- on two separate alarms -RRB- DO NOT get this machine . It ca n't handle it . The volume level is n't even the same when going between radio and cd . It 's cost is alot more than it 's worth . 	CDPlayer
THE GPX CD\/DIGITAL RADIO WAS A GREAT CHOICE FOR ME . I BELIEVE GOOD VALUE FORT THE MONEY AND AUDIO IS PRETTY GOOD . 	CDPlayer
On the list of features , it says that you can search by song title . This is not true . The player does not even display the title . Instead you can skip to the first song starting with any given letter . -LRB- With a lot of button pressing . -RRB- The `` random '' feature also has a \* major \* bug . It always picks the same songs ! Instead of being random , it always jumps to the same songs in the same order when you use the same CD . They should call it `` alternate order '' because that 's all it is . <p> Finally , the output is not loud enough , the headphone cord is too short , the player is a bit too wide , and you 'd better have a lot of batteries handy . I am disappointed by this product and will be returning it . 	CDPlayer
What a piece of junk . I bought this for my daughter and it didnt even last 6 months . Disney must be proud to put their name on this outstanding product . 	CDPlayer

"I heard that shower radios brake often ! But this one is great ! I have dropped it into a tub full of water , and onto the tile floor , still works great . And its really good with batteries .

This mini disc system is ideal as a backup . It has excellent sound quality and volume . It was easy to operate after I realized that the paper guard had to be removed ! I recommend it . 	CDPlayer
I bought this for my -LRB- ... -RRB- . The price was right and she needed a cd player so she can jam out in her room whenever she wanted to . She loves the fact that she has her `` own '' cd player . The sound is great and can be turned up very loud . There are too many flashy features which makes it easy to use and I would n't expect there to be too many considering I got it for under -LRB- ... -RRB- . I like that it has the option for batteries to take on the go with you or you can plug it in as well . If you are looking for an inexpensive cd player that can be used in the kitchen while you are cooking or in your child 's room for their jam session this is the one for you . 	CDPlayer
I bought this cd changer to complement a new Sony home theater system . I was replacing a 6 year old JVC shelf system that was superb . Right out of the box this changer had a bad habit of stopping play for no apparent reason during multi-disc shuffle play . I changed discs , using a variety of pre-recorded discs and CD-R 's , and was n't able to pinpoint a reason for the stoppages . There did n't seem to be any rhyme or reason to it . Sometimes the player played for a couple hours , and sometimes it would stop after only a song or two . It seemed to stop only while it was between tracks . After two weeks of playing with it , I exchanged it for another player -LRB- same model -RRB- , which did the exact same thing . Finally , I took the unit back today for a refund and bought a higher-priced Onkyo changer . 	CDPlayer
Purchased this to play my iPhone 's tunes at an upcoming party . Unfortunately , every time I plugged the iPhone in I got the `` Accessory not supported by this device '' message . Also , be aware - it takes \* 6 \* D batteries , not 4 . I had to scramble for a bit looking for the extra two batteries . It was able to work with my friend 's older iPod Touch - once we got it working , the sound was good ! The parts feel a bit flimsy , but no worse than I expected for the price . Overall a nice product , I wish it worked with what I have . 	CDPlayer
This was a very good purchase on my part -LRB- if i do say so myself -RRB- . This is a pretty good looking item and not expensive at all . I do n't know very many technical terms so bear with me . I hit the thing and dropped it and it did n't skip at all . I love how it has a radio too because most discman 's do n't . The resume function is very nice because if you have to turn it off for a while but did n't get to finish listening to your cd then you can turn it back on and not have to skip through the cd to get to the place you stopped . The headphones are very sturdy and give great sound ! This also has the random order function which is very nice because then you do n't have to listen to the cd in the same order every time . The hold switch is great because when you carry it around you do n't have to be careful where you put you hands . This thing is great and if you 're looking for a great quality , afordable portable CD player then this is the one for you . 	CDPlayer
i recently got a lightly used a 1996 nissan maxima that still has its original cassette player and i was dying to play my itouch music on it . i searched for a cheap solution and this product sounds like something that 'd be easy to use and should have good sound as per other ratings . well , the sound was fine , infect its quite nice as it handles the music well at moderate volume -LRB- bad bass at high volume -RRB- . however , one headache is that , a lot of the times when i try to put it in , it automatically gets ejected . the first time i put it in , it got stuck inside too . now idk if its just my old car or it is a problem w \/ this product or its just a rare occurring . but anyhow , if i keep trying for a few times it will eventually play w\/o a problem until i use it at the next time driving . for its price ... i guess its worth a try .

Is the worst cd player that I 've ever used , the sound is bad and the volume control do n't have enough balance , and the FM tuner is very noisy , really , all the walkman is very noisy , You must to use the line-out to hear it without noise , Please do n't buy 	CDPlayer
OK at medium to high volume , but if you turn the volume very low the sound skips and crackles off and on . 	CDPlayer
I bought this radio for my coworkers and I to use at work . We use it eight hours everyday and hav n't had any problems . We wanted a cd player to get ready to play Christmas music . This radio is very simple to use . The USB port is a really cool feature . We plug in our cell phones sometimes and listen to mp3s . It also has an auxillary port for mp3 players to plug in . Sound quality is ok and radio reception is ok . It does n't have a digital tuning dial , but other than that ... great radio . 	CDPlayer
I bought one . The CD 's are just not playing in the player . It 's locking up . I emailed tech support almost 2 weeks ago and have gotten no response . What a waste of money . 	CDPlayer
Do n't be fooled by this mini-CD player 's small build and lack of aesthetics . It actually packs a whole deal of punch . It recognizes MP3 CDRs and CDRWs quickly and plays well with the antishock working to its fullest . In most cases , the player loads the song into memory and stops spinning after a while minimizing the possibility of skips . Sound reproduction is good especially when a good pair of earphones or buds are used . It 's very light even with the 2 AAA batteries . The preset equalizers dun do much cos the Normal mode is all you ever wanted . Its fully functional remote comes with a 2-line LCD which though small packs a lot of info , from artist name , song title , and yes even album title to track\/directory numbers and time elapsed . Also includes the various random , programmable modes etc. . There 's also a useful file or directory skip that makes searching easier . <p> Now some of the downsides . There 's no screen on the player itself , the remote LCD is n't backlit , which means u ca n't see anything in the dark . The plastic casing 's a little flimsy and a metal body could take care of that as well as reduce the thickness a little . The rechareable batteries are a good concept but they just arent powerful and you dunno when they are ready from charging cos there 's no indication . Oh ya , there 's no resume function to continue from where you last hit stop . And lastly , mebbe a more attractive exterior using Compaq ' a colored-cover concept from Presario would be cool ! <p> But for a low price , the player 's a star . And mini CdR\/RWs are so -LRB- inexpensive -RRB- , you can pack about 35-40 songs on one . There 's nothing to complain for this price . 	CDPlayer
I had the luck of finding this CD player\/radio tuner on sale at roughly a third of its suggested retail price , and I 'd say it was a steal , and I would have even paid as much as half of its retail price and still say it was a steal . <p> The player looks gorgeous and sounds wonderful . I have been using Sony products for years , so for me it was very easy to program . Extra features like the MD link are nice to have too , although I do not know if I will ever use them . <p> Why this product did not get five stars : the digital radio tuner is just average compared to other tuners I have heard , even Sony 's own . However , it is very difficult to get good radio reception where I live so I am not too upset about that . Also , the remote control feels flimsy and cheap . I would have gladly paid a few extra dollars for a good remote . 	CDPlayer
I bought this for my 13 year-old son and it looks great and he loved it when I took it out of the box . It is actually fairly solid and not too bulky . The radio works well , even though it is manual tuning and that can be a little tricky in the NYC area since there are many stations crammed into the spectrum . The sound from the radio was pretty good , with clear tones and little distortion at moderate volume levels . However , the CD player and the SD card reader simply do not work . I am returning the unit to Amazon . 	CDPlayer
Installed these in my Giro skiing helmet for five days of spring skiing . They easily slipped into the helmet ' e ear flaps , stayed put with the Velcro fabric and worked great . 	CDPlayer
CD is great but ear phones have a very bad connection . Sony can do better 	CDPlayer
Received the player , and ca n't get it to work . Shows picture in the screen that is not shown in the instruction book . Contacted RCA customer support - takes up to 3 days for a response ! 	CDPlayer
This stereo is OK . It 's a great value but is missing a complete of really obvious features . For the auxiliary input evaluations , I 'm using an LG Optimus Android cellphone . Radio : Auto tuner , memory , quality are all good . Has 3 FM memory banks and 2 AM . Sounds good . Audio CD : Plays fine but has troubles resuming once turned off and back on . Data CD : Have n't tried . Aux In : Works , but pretty quiet . Have the volume as loud as possible on both head unit and device , which creates a pretty normal listening level , but the high volume from my phone creates a little distortion . -LRB- For perspective ; the volume goes up to `` 45 . '' Talk radio is good around 20 . Maxed on both the head unit and phone creates a comparable volume . -RRB- USB In : Not sure what 's wrong , here . It works , for a moment , but it seems as if the power is a little irregular or wiring is loose or something . The phone dismounts and re-mounts . It does n't stay connected long enough to actually play anything . The manual advertises the USB port is for memory sticks : Perhaps they 're more fault tolerant and work better ? SD In : Have n't tried . The face plate feels pretty cheap . It has buttons instead of dials , which make tuning and volume adjustments a little tedious , and the entire removable plate does n't sit perfectly flat . The brightness of the screen is not great . It 's FAR too bright at night , and too dim during the day . I have a query into Naxa to find out how to adjust brightness because it was n't obvious how to do it with their manual . -- UPDATE : 3 business days for a reply , and the answer is the brightness can not be changed . Also , the face plate buttons are bright blue . Neither the pictures on Amazon nor the box reflect this . Basically , it works , but spending a couple dollars more will buy you a much more capable stereo . But it 's also a much less obnoxious stereo than many other after-market head units , and that is worth something . 	CDPlayer
I chose this particular player for the size and use for me . I have a portable cassett player and I wanted a cd player only for audio-books . This works perfect for my nightstand . 	CDPlayer
Product is great for a lower end audio componet . Great Product if you do n't have a lot of money to spend . 	CDPlayer
Tailgate party = yes , backyard = yes , Kids ' games = yes , anything and everything else = yes , yes ! Still ca n't figured out how to set the time ??? But everything else works as expected , cosmetically not as good but it is still good ... Other problem , it is attached ... speakers have to be rigged to attach to control unit also no carrying handle ... but it is still good . 	CDPlayer
The sound quality is very crapy . Unclear to hear . No stero effect . The CD player is very unstable against any movement , because the CD is loosely put inside . Basically it 's struggeling to plays CDs when you carry it . 	CDPlayer
This is a great little portable . I use it in my car and love it to death . The sound quality is great , and the 120-sec skip protection works perfectly , In fact , in the two days I have been driving around with it -LRB- and I drive a LOT -RRB- , it has n't skipped once . Where else ya gonna find a portable CD\/MP3 player for less than 25 bucks ?! And a good one to boot ! Thank you Amazon , that 's why I love ya . 	CDPlayer
I bought this CD player about a week ago and the anti-skip is terrible on it . It skips when you walk with it , the sound quality is poor , and it lags when you try to skip tracks . The COBY company obviously does not know how to make a quality portable CD player and I am not very happy with my purchase . Stick with SONY or PANASONIC much better quality 	CDPlayer
I got this for my 8 year olds birthday . It 's perfect for her room and plays loud enough for me to shut her door . She loves it . It 's nice and portable too . 	CDPlayer
I really like it , it 's really great . I like having the cassette player to play my old tapes , plus the CD player for my new CDs . 	CDPlayer
I purchased this because it was cute and little , perfect for my daughter 's bedroom . I RETURNED this because it had very little volume control and the sound quality was AWFUL . 	CDPlayer
I was searching for a portable CD player with a radio on it , and I found this on Fred Meyer electronics section . Not bad , I 'm surprised ! Pros : Can preset up to 20 stations , for both AM\/FM stations Allows you to charge the batteries in the CD player , instead of purchasing new ones ; though it only needs AAs so you do n't really need to ! Overall nice radio reception Sleek design as well as lightweight Takes CDs , CD-R , CD-RW Cons : The radio has a fuzzy reception depending on where you place the headphones . You can not keep one CD in for a week or more , or it will just read `` NO DISC '' and then you must put in a new CD . Very irritating . I am surprised i have enjoyed this item ; it 's much better than my SONY player I had previously . I would have given this five stars , but I have only owned this product for a month , and there are a couple cons . I purchased this for $ 40 and hopefully it will stay good for the a low price ! 	CDPlayer
The color is cool aquamarine green and it cost -LRB- less -RRB- than its blue counterpart . This is certainly a better buy . The price is unbeatable . And then you have the reliability of Koss . Go for it . Its cheap and good for the price . 	CDPlayer
Purchased when I worked in a cubicle to use with headphones . Fine for that . Then put in my son 's room . Horrible sound . I paid $ 9.00 for it on a military base , new . That is about what it 's worth . 	CDPlayer
this cd player was meant as a gift , and the recepient of it is very very happy with it becasue it is easy to use and companct enough to carry and place just about anywhere 	CDPlayer
I purchased two of these `` on sale '' for $ 20.00 . We have had them for approximately 6 weeks . BOTH of them , within a few days of each other , completely quit working . The CD mechanism will not spin or work . These are worthless pieces of garbage , not worth a cent . 	CDPlayer
I own a original EXP103 , and it is great . Of course , I bought it while the CDRW and MP3 tech was still over -LRB- dollar amount -RRB- , but it is money well spent . Competing technology did not have the features i wanted on the EXP . For instance , the Resume\/Hold , Two output jacks , and full car\/home kit . A competitor at the time , the Rio VOLT had features i wanted , like BackLight and Title display , and a navigate button , but the EXP had the main features i needed . If philips would release a model with all those features , i would upgrade in a heartbeat . For those who dont like the EXP , you do n't know what you are talking about . If your MP3 's are skipping , it is because your recorder -LRB- stinks -RRB- , not the player . Buy new discs and recorder then try again . For audio discs , make sure the ESP is on , and because the player is very sensitive , excessive jarring associated with running is not recommended for CDDA -LRB- Audio CD -RRB- discs . MP3 cd 's will play without skipping 99.9 % of the time with even Bumpy-road jitter . 	CDPlayer
I received this Emerson CD player as a gift . I really enjoy listening to music , especially in my kitchen and DR , where space is at a premium . Since I 've had the player , it 's been used every day for at least 2 hours , sometimes 4 . I play CD 's on it , and also listen to the radio . Pros : - Clear , bright sound - CD 's can be programmed for play - CD songs can be set to repeat a single song or the entire CD - Space saving - Did I mention that this little CD really holds up to daily use ? Cons : - Radio has a knob so it 's difficult to change between stations . For me , this is a non-issue as I primarily listen to one station , or else to CD 's - Uh , ... I ca n't really think of anything else . So far , my Emerson CD player has lasted two and a half years . It 's only now starting to show signs of wear , and I will certainly be replacing it with another Emerson CD player . . 	CDPlayer
Value um value , this is a value , value ! its a value ! 20 more words less . . more less more then more maybe its the best 	CDPlayer
This product delivers what it promises . Your music in the shower without disturbing the rest of the house ! . Andy you can listen to your favorite CDs without any worry ! Great product , easy to use and set up . 	CDPlayer
Overall , I 'd say this is a pretty good CD player . I was concerned though when I first plugged it in and the CD just spun around and then STOPPED !!! Only when I tried it a second time , I held my finger down a little longer on the play button and the CD kept spinning . This might have to do with the fact that this item is an older one -- the label on the back says ` manufactured June 2006 ' . And if this is TRULY the case -LRB- and I do n't see it would n't be -- I mean , the label 's not lying ? -RRB- , the cost of this item should come WAY down . Like maybe $ 17.99 ? -LRB- Maybe that 's me -RRB- But I think an older ` new ' product should have a better price point . Also , on my unit there were some superficial scratches on it . These things should n't and wo n't affect the playability of my unit . Only when you buy something ` NEW ' , you do n't expect to see this kind of thing . Overall , I guess it 's OK . It 's just funny with electronics anyway . I mean , one day they 'll work , and the next ... we wo n't talk about that for now !!! 	CDPlayer
I opened up my new RCA CD Player after my Panasonic died -LRB- got several years out of that one -RRB- and hoping it 'd be an improvement . IT SUCKED !!! THe sound quality was terrible and it skipped constantly -LRB- jumped to random tracks in the middle of songs -RRB- . I changed the batteries a few times -LRB- even went from my usual nickel-metal hydride to some old fashioned alkaline -RRB- and no improvement . Do n't waste your money . It 's crap . 	CDPlayer
i didnt buy this from amazon but i got it in an electronics shop this is a very good maodel mp3 water proof good lock 30 stationery memorys sounds extra base great headphones but the problem with this that instead of saying the name of the song it says the song number which is not useful if you have 300 songs for you wont remember the song also this doesnt have input or out put thats why its four stars i also think that you cant get the last song im not sure cause i have had this item for 2 days there is another mp3 cheaper that says the name and has input out put but i liked how this one looked 	CDPlayer
CD Player is perfect for the space in which we purchased it . I would definitely order a product similiar to this if needed ! 	CDPlayer
Operates flawlessly even during jolting activities like rollerblading . At first I thought it was skipping alot but as it turns out my wallet kept bouncing around in the fanny pack and hitting the ` skip memory ' button on the front causing a one second drop out each time . 	CDPlayer
Within 5 months this product proved worthless . If I attempt to use it i enjoy a symphonic medley of 100 % volume , no static ; to 60 % static at reduced volume ; to no volume at all . Have used other ipods with it and received same result . Doesnt help faciitate your Ipod addiction and is frustrating as all hell on those long rides . 	CDPlayer
The radio\/cd player and alarm is easy enough for my sister -LRB- for whom I purchased it -RRB- to work -- except for the alarm . She 's afraid to try anything new . Thanks ... I saw it in a store for $ 6 more than I paid for it . The free shipping offers are a real plus . Many thanks . 	CDPlayer
I bought this modem after my Motorola Surfboard kept dropping out . This one was more stable for the first few months , but after that I noticed a sharp decline in my upload speed -LRB- it went from around 2Mbps to .15 Mbps -RRB- . After fighting with my cable company for a few weeks and trying just about everything I could think of to fix the problem , I finally decided to try switching it out with my old surfboard modem . This fixed the issue . There is no doubt in my mind that this modem was the problem . I would not recommend this product and I am currently looking for a new modem . 	Cable Modem
i needed to up date my whole wireless system for the house this was the perfect starting piece for a overhaul . awesome modem 	Cable Modem
Great Product . Worked as advertised right out of box . Had to contact Comcast to activate it and deactivate my rental box . I 'm pretty computer capable , but I did n't encounter anything a non-techie could n't work through . 	Cable Modem
I was n't paying attention . My bad ! Had I realized , I might have been writing this review many , many months ago . First , a little research ! My modem from Comcast was model #SB 5101 -LRB- Motorola -RRB- DOCSIS 2.0 , and it worked just great for those 3 years + of service , never a hitch ! Ignorant enough , and a shock to my system ... to learn I was `` renting '' their equipment to the tune of 7.00 monthly . Now ... I immediately bulked , the feeling of being ripped off by a company who gives no quarter to their `` veteran '' subscribers . A list of their `` approved '' modems easily discovered at -LRB- Comcast.com -RRB- The `` math '' was easy enough too ... within less than a year , my new Motorola would put me back into the `` black '' . There 's literally no learning curve to this process of exchange , a no brainer ... that is , if you can read ! -LRB- g -RRB- The procedure is just as these others have stated . Turn everything off , change your cables a bit , bypass your router -LRB- if you have a network -RRB- , plug everything back where it was , boot your computer , and immediately , as you punch in your browser ... a page from Comcast comes up ! Be sure you have your account number in front of you , and your phone # of record . For me , the Mac ID was already there , did n't have to type it in at all . They will automatically set up the new modem in just a few minutes . Really simple ! READ these reviews ! Some are very helpful if you 're a comcast customer ! Just be sure you take notes the old fashion way ... pen and paper , before you disconnect your old modem ! This Motorola , SB6121 , does not run `` hot '' , at least not for me . It 's barely warm . As the reviews attest , it runs faster , much faster !! The details are there also , in these reviews . You can believe them . The `` hardest '' part , this whole procedure ? The returning of Comcast 's property . You must find the nearest Service Center to return it ! If you request a service tech to come pick it up , they are going to charge you plenty ! And ... whatever you do ... . . get your receipt as evidence you returned it ... SAVE IT , and keep checking your itemized bill . I do n't trust them ! You might . : o -RRB- Would n't you think ... the money we pay them , these very necessary `` extras '' would be included ?? Bummer ! My next project ? This HD receiver box , another dumb rental ! Amazon , here I come again ! -LRB- g -RRB- 	Cable Modem
SB6121 is working fine out of the box and was easy to install and required a phone call to ISP Cox for it to link up with the system . 15 minutes and bingo ... 	Cable Modem
I 'll make this quick and hope I 'm not jinxing myself . This was the easiest thing I 've done in dealing with Comcast . I lease this Ubee modem already through Comcast and wanted to just buy one instead . I originally bought the Motorola SB6121 . I 'm sure the modem is fine , but I had issues in getting it working with the Comcast representative , ` course that was probably the main problem right there . Anyway , I returned it and bought this Ubee -LRB- which is the exact model I 've been leasing -RRB- . I unplugged their modem , plugged mine in , went to Comcast\/activate self install webpage and 10 minutes or so later I 'm up a running with no issues -LRB- knock on wood -RRB- . I gave Comcast their modem back today and hope I do n't have to fuss at their billing department next . 	Cable Modem
Device does exactly what it is supposed to do . When the Motoroloa Docsis 3.0 modem I acquired would not function on my cable provider 's network I decided to give the UBEE a try . It performs flawlessy , wish I could say the same for the cable company . 	Cable Modem
Very nice one . It suits my needs and up to the expectation . Easy to install and am satisfied with the product 	Cable Modem
I have charter cable and I went from averaging 20m to 30m . You have to actually call Charter Cable to complete the set up . Set up took about 30 minutes total . 	Cable Modem
"This will be the third of this modem I 've bought ... now the rental fees are looking better , yeesh ! To explain - I live downtown in a small town -LRB- 17K -RRB- . Last year we had terrible storms and crazy flooding which killed power to half of mainstreet . Not my side of town , but we still got surges and flickers . I had n't realized that the first modem was n't plugged into a surge protector at all . Lightning storm , modem died , sad face . Not a problem with the modem at all - when it 's not fried , it works great ! Bought this modem again , used it very reliably for a year , but more storms , moving and a new apartment where Charter had to re-fish the cable through the wall because the old one had gashes in it and was dropping nearly 10 Volts lower in signal than it should have been ... I think it fried the modem again . So , perhaps the modem \* could \* be a bit more resilient , but honestly , it 's a piece of relatively sensitive electronics . I have to pay the price -LRB- again -RRB- for not being very careful with it . I use this coupled with a <ahref=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001V72S06/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/191-4998959-2687406""> Belkin Wireless 150N Router -LRB- F6D4230-4 -RRB- </a> and get excellent wireless range and speed - even when in college I was sharing wireless connectivity with up to 10 other people , some of whom gamed on it -LRB- though I can not tell you what game -RRB- without complaint . Overall I 'm very pleased with this router , which is why I 'm buying it for the third time , along with the <ahref=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000J2EN4S/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/191-4998959-2687406""> Belkin BE112230-08 12-Outlet Home\/Office Surge Protector with Telephone and Coaxial Protection </a> to hopefully ward off any additional modem purchases . I 'll post again if there are any other updates . "	Cable Modem
I like that this thing is gigabit and is faster than my cable systm . When the cable gets faster I wo n't have to buy another router . 	Cable Modem
To all you naysayers , lets start here : This was purchased for use on Comcast . Yes , Comcast currently has this very modem on their `` approved '' list ; yes , I did my homework ; yes , I am smarter than a rock ; and yes , Motorola should have done more to insure their product works reliably on such a major providers system . This modem refused to provision on the network , simple as that . Comcast could see the modem , ping it and send the provisioning information ... the MODEM refused it . So did the second modem . I 'm a big fan of Motorola products but this is disappointing . Also , the HFC MAC seems to be all wrong . Most MACs start 00 and these are starting with 74 . I do not know if that contributed to the problem or not though . 	Cable Modem
I bought the SB6121 , because Comcast 's list of approved broadband modems ; showed this modem is approved for all speed tiers . I did not want to be charged $ 7 for using their modem . It is not cheap , but of coarse you get what you pay for . This model of modem is not found at consumer electronic stores . Have an XBOX 360 connected to this modem 's online gaming capability feature . No problems , at all in this area . I 'm very satisfied with the SB6121 . One complaint I have about this modem is that it was assembled in China . 	Cable Modem
I have had this for about a couple of months now and i can say that this is one of the best modems out there . The main reason i bought this is because Comcast charges 7 dollars a month for their modem rental . Installation is really easy , all you have to do is call your cable provider and provide them your MAC ID on the modem and in less then 2 min you are up and running . What a difference it made ! I actually get speeds to what i am paying for . Lots a cable provides really dont tell you that you can do this which is understandable b\/c they want that extra money but for me the savings alone is well worth it ! A MUST BUY !!!! 	Cable Modem
I had opportunity to test two different cable modems on Comcast business service . One was Motorola SB6121 and the other Zoom 5341 . Both are DOCSIS 3.0 , which is required for high speed cable service . Comcast tech support was not thrilled about Zoom while they praised Motorola SurfBoard high . As it turned out , average Comcast technician , who suppose to activate the modem , has a trouble with the Zoom serial number . My configuration of Comcast service in this case is 2 times 50 Mb\/s download and 10 Mb\/s upload speed . This service supposes to supply over 1000 users with Internet access , load balance mode . First line was activated with Zoom modem and everything went well for several days . To the second line I attached Motorola modem ; Comcast managed to deactivate Zoom modem on the first line in process , though . Initial test of Motorola showed expected values in download and upload speeds . However , with network connected to it , Motorola download speed did n't reach more than 10 Mb\/s download with upload of 2 Mb\/s . After 24 hours of 1000 people complaining , Comcast Technician came to check the installation and re-activate Zoom modem . Test of Motorola modem with a single laptop connected did n't show any abnormality : Download and upload speed were at nominal values . Since I could n't put in place my load balancer yet , I switched the network to the Zoom modem and made 1000 surfers happy again . In a couple of days my load balance configuration should go live , using one Motorola and one Zoom modem . I intend to update this review with the result of Motorola performance in this configuration , for potential buyers interested in the Motorola SB6121 . Well , I decided to buy Comcast Internet service for home and I did n't have dilemma which modem to chose ; Zoom it is . I ordered on-site installation because my cable coax had to be replaced and expecting confusion with Zoom serial number -LRB- that happened as expected , too -RRB- . Anyway , Comcast got it online and my modem is happily blinking , ever after -LRB- two weeks in service -RRB- . The one ordered here has slightly different housing than the first one I dealt with -LRB- bought at Microcenter -RRB- ; I assume that Zoom made a change in design and this one does not get as warm -LRB- as the other one -RRB- . Price difference between Zoom and Motorola on Amazon is not worth mentioning ; while Motorola is a big name in communication equipment I felt more comfortable for going with Zoom this time .

Great modem Works like a chame with Comcast service . Saved the modem charge from comcast and got a better modem . 	Cable Modem
This is the 2nd Motorola modem I have bought . My last modem was SB5101 and was working just fine but realized I needed a faster modem for gaming . This new modem has better led indicator lights , more stability\/balance , and many ventilation holes to keep the modem cool . My ISP is Cox and activation went smoothly without problems . I have tested my internet connection on speedtest.net and pingtest.net beforehand and here are my results , SB5101 ; Downstream : 27.35 mb , Upstream : 1.89 mb , Ping : 16ms , Jitter : 4ms SB6121 ; Downstream : 41.75 mb , Upstream : 4.95 mb , Ping : 10ms , Jitter : 1ms -LRB- Wired directly to my PC -RRB- I could clearly see the speed even on my browser , as it loads pages faster than before . My gaming experience is even better with less lag . Do not hesitate to buy this , especially gamers . DO N'T BE A NOOB ! 	Cable Modem
Works as advertised , very simple set up . Plug and play . Just call your provider to authorize modem . DOCSIS 3.0 upgrade works great . Based on the residential service I pay for with my provider , I consintently get 35 Mbps down and 5-10 Mbps up . The main difference that I noticed is that when you have multiple users streaming the data transfer works much better . 	Cable Modem
Installed the Cisco cable modem and called the Internet Service provider with MAC information and in seconds I was up and running . This unit is a replacement for a Motorola modem that was having issues . It is working and performing great . I recommend this modem . 	Cable Modem
I was in a bind and I needed it in a hurry . It arrived earlier than promised and in good condition . Imagine my surprise when the technician plugged it in and it would n't connect . I was in a bind so I had to rent one of their modems until I could replace it . My other option was to wait and pay for another service call ... I needed the connection ASAP . I bought a better cable modem at the big box and got a much better deal . And it worked when we connected it and plugged it in . Foolish me , I did n't shop the price like I should have . The exact same modem was $ 30 cheaper at the big box . I returned the modem to Amazon . No muss , no fuss , no hassles . They reversed the charge promptly . This transaction has changed my opinion of shopping at Amazon . TWO bad experiences with Amazon within the same month . I will be more careful with future purchases . 	Cable Modem
Purchased the Motorola SB6121 cable modem in March 2012 . I 've had it for over four months now and i have no complaints about it 's performance . I purchased this modem to replace my moto 5101 docsis 2modem , right off the bat i noticed the difference , very quick my web pages change in the blink of an eye wow . I now have two bonded channels , send and receive led 's are blue , the link light is flashing blue so i ` am operating in high - speed gigabit ethernet base t mode . I have not had one issue with this modem , I love it , what more can i say . I love things that work right out of the box . 	Cable Modem
I am using this modem with Comcast service . The setup was very easy , although in typical ISP fashion the guy on the phone had no idea was was going on . I was able to set up the router with just a phone call , although they made me purchase their ` self-installation kit ' for $ 10 -LRB- I never recieved the kit in the mail -RRB- . But enough ranting about Comcast , the modem itself seems to be working very well . I have not experienced any drops in service and my speeds appear very consistent . I have not done any investigation into my actual speeds yet , but everything feels as quick as I would expect from a Docsis 3.0 modem . All in all , I am very satisfied with my purchase , provided it lasts a few years . 	Cable Modem
Stinks , was a lousy modem , gave less than 1\/2 speed advertised . I 'm gonna try buy.com instead . Or eBay , shopping.com , of anyone other than AMD . 	Cable Modem
I am pulling above 50Mbit with my Comcast 50Mbit plan . That is fine by me . I think this bad boy clocked me at 54Mbit by 11Mbit . Not bad . Some people complain it gets hot ... no such issues here . It 's warm , but most of my routers get hotter than this . Believe me I am putting it through the wringer . My bandwidth usage with this bad boy over 3 weeks or so is very close to 1TB -LRB- that 's 1000GB -RRB- . Uptime is great as well . I had some issue programming it but whatever , I have n't NOT had such problems . Just call Comcast and give them your digits if the online tool does n't work . Keep your box , it has a special serial -LRB- customer s\/n -RRB- as some mentioned . Regards , Will 	Cable Modem
I purchased this modem about 2 months ago and it mysteriously stopped working about a week ago . I come to find out from Comcast that they did some technology upgrades to their lines which made this modem not compatible with their high-speed internet service in the Atlanta region . Not sure if these upgrades affect other markets but you will run into the same issue . Despite the incompatibility with Comcast now , this product is solid -LRB- as are most products that Cisco\/Linksys comes out with -RRB- . 	Cable Modem
I wanted to upgrade my DOCSIS 2.0 Motorola SB5101u to a DOCSIS 3.0 model . I wonder how many Comcast customers know what Internet speeds they are paying for . I just spent 15 minutes searching within my account and I ca n't find any explicit mention of speed . However , my bill says I 've got Preferred Double Play and Comcast 's advertising says that comes with speeds of `` Up to 20 Mbps download speeds with PowerBoost  '' . Well , even with my old SB5101u , I was consistently getting 23-25 Mbps download and 3.6 Mbps upload on my desktop connected to the router with an ethernet cable , so it 's not surprising that the new modem did n't give me any improvement . Still , it works fine and I 'll keep it as a hedge against any improvements that are not obvious to me at the moment or things that Comcast may have coming down the pike . I did not try installing the modem myself as I knew Comcast would have to activate it from their end . It was n't trivial for the Comcast agent at the other end of the phone . He kept mentioning something about getting an IP address and not getting a boot file . But , with a few retries and me unplugging the modem and plugging it back in to reset it , we were ultimately successful . What I take from my experience and the reports of others is that the amount of agony one has to go through depends on the Comcast rep who gets the call , BUT if you persevere the installation should ultimately prove successful . 	Cable Modem
The modem was a breeze to set up and has been functioning without fail ever since . I would recommend this to Comcast cable users . 	Cable Modem
Originally purchased a refurbished modem that was defective upon receipt . It was a bit of a hassle in terms of time and effort to receive a return authorization and mail defective unit back for replacement which took about 2 weeks . Second unit works great . 	Cable Modem
I recieved this Motorola Signal Booster , promptly on time , installed it and it is doing just what I expected . I had some remote outlets in my in house cable system that would have had to imporve to be unsatisfactory , thsy are now very nice . I would recommend it under these circumstances . 	Cable Modem
Good Speed , easy instalation . no problems at all till now . Simple status page for monitoring the signals . no regrets : -RRB- . 	Cable Modem
We have Comcast cable and decided to discontinue renting their modem , which was a 2.0 - save $ 7 a month ... new modem will pay for itself , right ? I ordered the modem , Amazon delivered it the next day ... I love being a Prime member . Our connection was operating at 12 Mbps and jumped to 25 Mbps . We are a family that runs Netflix on the TV , Tivo , a Kindle , DSi , and up to 3 wireless laptops at a time ! 	Cable Modem
Modem would restart itself all the time and recently has been doing it more often . Finally I said forget it and am using the Cisco one provided to me by my internet provider RCN . I initially did n't realize it was the modem , once I did it was outside of the return window . I do plan to call amazon and see what they can do though . 	Cable Modem
After reading reviews I purchased this modem thinking it would be just what I was looking for . I was in need of a modem so I payed for next day delivery -LRB- Friday morning -RRB- . Package arrived early Saturday morning , and was happy that it arrived so early . Opened up the box , and went about getting it set up . Plug in the power , and NOTHING ! The modem will NOT power on ! Tried every outlet in this house . Nothing . Very , very upset and disappointed . Seller only offers a refund , will not send a new one for you to have . Guess I 'm headed to Best Buy after my refund clears . 	Cable Modem
We were having trouble receiving some high def channels . Some were pixelated , others just did n't come through at all . We installed the BDA-S2 where the cable comes into the house , and our problems appear to be fixed . Our cable gets split to 6 different ports , and this boosts the signal at those ports to an adequate level . FDC power level went from -17 dBmV to -6 dBmV . The cable modem still works just fine . We have n't noticed an improvement in its performance but we also never really had a problem with its performance . 	Cable Modem
The modem is n't even bad at all . I used to have a DOCSIS 2.0 Modem and it sucked . it kept on dropping its connection to comcast . i bought this modem and it worked perfectly . i dont know what other people are talking about , because this modem works just fine to me . 	Cable Modem
So I need to say first off I bought this Modem for my new comcast service installation . Before I had used the rental modems at several other places but noted that my best internet speed was always with the Aris modem I had rented from comcast originally . I did the math and determined that in the long run buying my own modem was cheaper than a rental , plus I could take it with me when I moved . -LRB- College student -RRB- so I had used speedtest to see that although I was paying for a 25mb\/s connection I was getting nowhere near that speed with the previous qwest and comcast modems . I was not happy at all . Immediatley upon installation I ran a speedtest and found that with my 25mb\/s connection I was getting 40mb\/s download and 25mb\/s upload . This is AMAZING compared to the 12mb\/s download and 6mb\/s upload I was getting with my previous modems . . Now the bad , This guy was a pain to install . I do network management and computer repair and have installed dozens of modems\/router setups . this guy just did not want to connect to comcast . I had initially had it installed next to my TV then within a few hours wanted it directly hooked to my router and desktop in the next room over . upon unplugging it and running a line over to the next room I had hours worth of trying everything from resetting all of these devices and troubleshooting . I eventually just left it unplugged for an hour or so as I was about to return the item as I feared it was defective . Upon my return I replugged the entire setup into my network and it immediately connected to comcast as It should . I ca n't say this is optimum for any piece of hardware but I am happy with my new device and internet speed . I can stream Movies and the such while playing Counterstrike with no drop in bandwidth OR lag . 	Cable Modem
While I did not notice any increased performance when replacing my old -LRB- Docsis 1 ? -RRB- modem , the new modem does bring the modem up to the latest DOCSIS revision recommended by a Comcast technician . So I am how poised for the future , hopefully ? The modem works fine and the speed is most likely constrained by the speed of the Comcast network . 	Cable Modem
Product performs excellent , was able to hook up three additional Tvs and the pictures are great . Delivery was three days ahead of time WOW 	Cable Modem
I do n't know what to think . According to all these great reviews , this router is suppose to walk on water . Well , my connection sucks ! You 'd think I had dial-up internet vs cable wireless . At certain points throughout the day , my connection is great . However 80-90 % of the day its very slow . I have a MAC MacBook Pro . I ca n't have too many windows open simultaneously . Its only when I close windows that my connection speeds up . Its awful . I 'm going to put this thing on eBay to recoup some of my $ 100 , and try another router before I totally give up on Comcast . 	Cable Modem
Modem worked well right out of the box , easy to set up and connect to wireless router . Only complaint is that the customer S\/N is not on the modem and you must get it off the box the modem comes in . You need this to hook up modem to internet provider . 	Cable Modem
Cable modem is not something for you to take care of in daily life . A good modem should be installed and forgotten . It is the reason why I did n't upgrade my modem from DOCSIS-1 to DOCSIS-2 until 2009 . I did n't do it until I realized my internet speed is much slower than what Comcast promised then . That upgrade raised the average download throughput from 5 to 15Mbps . I have been using the same internet service for more than one decade . The cable company promised 1.5 Mbps at very beginning . With the same monthly rate they pushed up their promised speed gradually . The speed was raised to 20Mbps recently . But you can not enjoy the speed boost if you keep using your old hardware . My 3-year old Motorola SB5101 is also a good installed and forgotten modem . But the connection speed can become very slow in evening , the rush hours of residential internet . DOCSIS-3 provides the channel bonding feature which is better in retaining bandwidth even in rush hours . You must contact the cable company to activate your new cable modem before using it . It 's not a big deal for me because I did it twice in past decade , but I can not recall all the details . The first Comcast specialist tried to activate my SB6121 many times w\/o luck so that he transferred my call to a 2nd tier specialist . He asked me to power-cycle my modem -LRB- shut down then turn on again -RRB- , then it works flawlessly . Yes , power-cycle is a necessary step in activation . The first specialist forgot it and wasted me almost one hour . My download speed is quite stable -LRB- 16 ~ 21Mbps -RRB- now , even in evening . The throughput is only slightly faster but much more consistent than before . It works as promised . Internet technology keeps evolving so that you can not always install and forget it . UPDATE -- I replaced my old Linksys router with E3200 one month later . Now the download speed is always fixed at 25Mbps , 24\/7 . Looks like 25Mbps is the speed cap set by Comcast . The SB6121 + E3200 combo should be able to run even faster if I am willing to pay higher monthly rate . Once again you need up-to-date gears in order to get full bandwidth from the internet connection you pay for . 	Cable Modem
Super fast ! Works great with Charter . Have n't disconnected so far . Wo n't have to pay for modem rental ever again !!! A recommended buy ! 	Cable Modem
As a Comcast customer , I was a little hesitant to buy this modem after reading all the reviews . However , I needed a new one really bad because the old modem just kept on resetting ; also wanted to see how much speed improvement the DOCSIS 3.0 gets . So I took the gamble and ordered one . I immediately opened the box when it got delivered to my doorstep . Plugged in the power , waited a few minute for it to completely boot up , then plugged Ethernet cable to the modem and directly to my laptop . Unplugged the coax cable from old modem and plugged into the SB6121 modem . No surprise here , yellow warning icon . No connection . Called Comcast and provided the MAC Address -LRB- Comcast does n't use customer S\/N for their setup -RRB- , but no luck as the rep told me the router is shown online but wo n't communicate with their server . Still no luck after a couple of tries , so she said to leave the modem on and she will call back to check in 30 mins . 30 mins passed . She called and gave it another attempt ... nothing ! She then politely apologized about the situation and said the unit is probably a defect , suggested I return the item to get a new unit . -LRB- REALLY ??? I thought in the back of my mind -RRB- So I brushed her off by thanking her for her help , while telling myself this unit is perfectly fine . After I hung up the phone , I decided to power it off , turn back on and leave it on overnight -LRB- as others mentioned that method worked for them -RRB- . Little do you know . After powering back on , I hit F5 to refresh my browser page . The rainbow colored GOOGLE logo with a search bar underneath showed up in the middle of the browser window . FINALLY UP AND RUNNING !! Quickly did a speedtest and got 14Mbps download speed -LRB- subscribed for 10Mbps -RRB- . IT is blazing fast !! Very stable and have n't had to reset the modem after 1 month . 	Cable Modem
This is a Comcast approved modem . It 's rated the maximum stars -LRB- 3 -RRB- by Comcast . Was very easy to setup , Comcast took only minutes to activate it . I highly recommend this modem , runs fairly cool . Why pay Comcast for a leased modem . I leased my modem for 5 years , @ $ 7.00 per month , I could have purchased one new modem per year at that rate . The one thing Comcast does not tell or do for customers , The modems we lease are never updated to the newest and greatest , so with the older modems you never keep up with the speeds available to customers . I highly recommend this modem !! 	Cable Modem
Nice ! With Comcast Tech on the phone , it took less than 10 minutes to get it right . I suggest having your provider on the line as you setup , and plug things in in correct order : cable , ether , then power . We did have to remove power to my Netgear WNDR3400v2 router for correct training and auth , once there , we powered up the router and everything worked within 2 minutes ! I 'll update if any further issues . 	Cable Modem
I 've purchased this modem to replace an old Motorola Surfboard 5101U that gave me unreliable connections . Installation was easy ; all it took was a 10 minute call to Comcast and it was up and running . The speed is great ; I have the Performance package through Comcast and am able to get consistent 20-25 Mbps download and 3-6 Mbps upload speeds . So far I have not noticed any problems with this modem and have had strong reliable connections . 	Cable Modem
I received this item and had made arrangements to cable service started . What I thought was interesting was the tech from Comcast said this device was completely unusable since the serial number had been registered elsewhere I had to rent a unit from him . After a couple of days , I called the service department and while on the phone he told me all I needed was the MAC address and they would take care of the rest . Well , needless to say , the unit works great ! Was even able to connect my router to and set up my network with no issues . What was Comcast thinking ? Well , when I got my bill they overcharged me for the service I signed up for and kept the rent charges on the bill after I returned their modem . The modem works great and I 'm glad I made the purchase ! 	Cable Modem
It works great , it works well with Comcast and is what they recommend\/lease out so that 's perfect for me and it came out to be cheaper to buy it instead of leasing it . This is definitely the cheapest you 'll come across so I recommend it from amazon . 	Cable Modem
Recently purchased this modem to replace another older motorola gateway model . Upgraded my comcast connection to 20Mbps . Comcast says I should be expecting anywhere between 20-25 Mbps but now speed test is showing around 32-35Mbps . I hope it stays this way . This product just rocks . 	Cable Modem
Like the tittle says ; I think this modem is great ! its a great deal since I 've seen older models sold at walmart for about the same price . I did n't want to rent a modem from Comcast and I was a bit worried at first that the tech was going to tell me he could n't use this one , but it all worked perfectly ! I have the modem connected directly to my router for wifi and I have fast internet on all my devices at home -LRB- a blue-ray player w \/ wifi , two smartphones and two laptops -RRB- . It 's super fast and has not given me any issues since I bought it back in Novermber 2011 . 	Cable Modem
Two in a row came dead on arrival . Both would turn on and begin a power cycling loop , turning themselves off every minute or so . I 'd done quite a lot of research before picking this modem , quietly hoping that the known power cycling issue would n't affect this batch , but it was n't the case . Amazon handled the shipment and returns promptly , but it simply was n't to be . After two returns and hours wasted on the phone with Comcast support , I gave up and bought a different model . Even a trivial amount of quality assurance should have caught this issue so I 'm far less than impressed with Motorola 's efforts on this model . 	Cable Modem
So all the reviews were glowing so i bought it ... i received it the day they did the install so i have no idea the speed i would have had with a different modem . I did however receive higher speed from this modem then cox is selling me . i 'm on the 55down and5 .5 up plan and with this im getting about 65down average and 7.5 average up ... so that 's good . one of the best things is in the month i have owned it i have never had to reset this modem , always a solid connection . love it . 	Cable Modem
Works seamlessly with my Comcast account . No issues at all after setup . I would recommend this docsys 3.0 version for sure . 	Cable Modem
Works great on Comcast ! Got rid of the crappy old Comcast rental modem which costs $ 84\/Year ... forever . Fast , easy to setup , easy to open packaging ! You have to return your old rental modem to Comcast first before they let you switch it over . Write down the model number and take one of the stickers it comes with that has the Serial\/MAC address on it when you return your old one and they will switch it over . 	Cable Modem
We own a big house that is now a Bed and Breakfast . There are eight televisions and a lot of cable going to them ! The long cables to multiple televisions made for weak signal strength reception . The Motorola Signal Booster is now providing great digital quality to every part of the house ! I am more than pleased with the booster ! 	Cable Modem
PROS : At the time of writing this review , I 've had this modem plugged in and running for a month straight without any problems . I get the correct speed from my modem -LRB- 20 mpbs -RRB- and I have n't experienced any latency problems -LRB- PC and XBox 360 gaming are always fluid -RRB- . CONS : The modem does n't have any management capabilities . Accessing the modem management page -LRB- 192.168.100.1 on most home networks -RRB- only gives you status pages and no capabilities to spoof MAC addresses or provide ISPs with a username and password . Make sure your ISP supports this modem before you buy it . CONCLUSION : For the money -LRB- less than $ 80 -RRB- this is a great modem that may not have frills but has reliability which is far more important . I would recommend this modem -LRB- as long as your ISP supports it -RRB- . 	Cable Modem
This worked great while i had it , I upgraded my service and could no longer use it . This is a great modem if you play games or do video online . 	Cable Modem
I daytrade so I need a reliable , fast modem and this is it . Had the router a few weeks and it is great . Good reception with a strong WiFi signal throughout a 2 story 2600 sqft . house . You may need to make a few tweaks for your internet provider and here they are . 1 -RRB- Use this if you 're having slow download\/upload speeds or in my case over 65 % packet loss on a ping test . You can check your DL & UL speeds here -LRB- speedtest -LRB- dot -RRB- net -RRB- and test for packet loss here -LRB- pingtest -LRB- dot -RRB- net -RRB- . Login to the routers gateway using 192.168.0.1 and you can find your username and pass in your instruction manual . Once in click Firewall at the top , then Web Filter on the side panel . Toward the bottom of the page uncheck `` IP Flood detection '' and click apply . 2 -RRB- Some people have reported a dropped WiFi signal after a few days of use . This is generally caused by interference from other wireless signals in the area . To fix this login to your gateway again . This time click on Wireless at the top then Radio on the side panel . Change your Control Channel # to any of the numbers 1-11 listed then click apply . If you 're still getting a dropped signal after the change then switch to another channel until your signal is constant . By default the Control Channel is set to Auto which is supposed to automatically switch channels when the router detects interference but this does n't always work so well . These two items tend to be the biggest issues with this router . Once you get it setup right it should be clear sailing . 	Cable Modem
Not sure if self activation with comcast is browser specific , but I could n't get it to pop up with IE . When I tried to hit the web with Firefox , the page came right up and I went through the steps and was back online in about 5 minutes . I do n't remember the page off the top of my head , but best to look it up before you do the modem swap with your account no. . After the swap though , I could n't get to google 's site with either browsers . If I hit it by IP address , it works fine . I researched it and nothing was conclusive . But apparently there is some issue with the modem and comcast . I did n't want to be on the phone with comcast forever or listen to finger printing , so I found a workaround and just added google 's IP address to my hosts file . Changing my DNS servers did not work . I 'm also getting quick disconnects and reconnects from my chat program that 's never happened before . But it has n't affected my fast downloads\/uploads that I 'm aware of . And multiple packet testing shows no lost . Oh , forgot to mention I did need to upgrade my old router too because I did not get any speed improvements initially . Make sure you get a gigabit router in order to utilize full potential . 	Cable Modem
I am a `` computer literate '' person , but not a techie . This modem is very user friendly , is really fast and is not at all complicated . Actually you just plug it in and it works ... so its fairly impossible to mess up . Its very compact -LRB- much smaller than my previous modems -RRB- and is clean-lined and nice-looking . 	Cable Modem
I have no complains at all with the modem . It does it 's job and has not given me any trouble in the few months I have been using it . 	Cable Modem
I live in Chicago and have RCN as my cable\/ISP . Last week I got a letter saying that the modem rental rate was going up $ 2\/month . Bought this modem , hooked it up , called RCN with my MAC address , rebooted my computer , and voila ! Only gets 4 stars because it is just a cable modem afterall . If it had some other features , it could 've gotten a 5 . Mine was shipped with a cd . If you explore what is on the cd , you will find the install instructions . If you hav n't installed electronics or know how to explore your cd for the installation guide , you may have some difficulty getting this to work , and you might end up posting a bad review on amazon when really , it 's just you . If you 're spending more money to rent , than it would be to buy a modem , this is a solid buy . 	Cable Modem
I have tried both the SB6120 and the SB6121 and the signal levels and speeds were the same on both . The SB6121 is a little smaller than the SB6120 but runs much warmer than the SB6120 . Looks like they tried to cram too much hardware into too small of a space . My SB6121 did not come with the power save button -LRB- it 's listed as an optional feature -RRB- , so about the only difference between the two models is the design . Both the SB6120 and the SB6121 use the same firmware : labeled SB612X . So unless you want the different looking LED lights and a smaller and warmer box for a higher price , stay with the SB6120 . As far as speeds are concerned : the multiple channel bonding on these DOCSIS 3.0 modems is nice for sustained constant speeds . It also makes it easier for your ISP to enforce the speed cap if they choose to do so -LRB- Comcast in my case does -RRB- . I was getting 20 + Mbps down and 3 + Mbps up on my old Linksys DOCSIS 2.0 modem , however that was the peak when the transfer first started , then it would taper off . The DOCSIS 3.0 modem stays right at the 12\/2 ceiling of my speed tier , but at least the speeds stay right up there and do not drop off after a few seconds . 	Cable Modem
BDA-S4 Boost Only 12X 484095-001-00 Boost 32X Part of it because of the splitter . If you need better Boost -LRB- and only use single TV -RRB- , choose 484095-001-00 . If you need splitter and do not need so much boost you can go with BDA-S4 Wish BDA-S4 have more boost . maybe 20X . It Will be great 	Cable Modem
Comcast was charging $ 7 per month for modem rent . So I bought this one and it 's giving me more than 20mbps speed where my plan was actually 15mbps . With my old modem I used to get less than 15mbps speed . Good one . But only draw back I saw is it is hanging in atleast once in every couple of weeks . I had to reboot it again to get it work . 	Cable Modem
No Dice , tried to get the modem to work with multiple Comcast techs . Never could be recognized on there system despite being on the master list . 	Cable Modem
this modem only lasted 7 weeks and rarely worked correctly during that time . very disappointed that I didnt keep box so I cant send back 	Cable Modem
I bought this after realizing that I should have bought my own cable modem years ago to avoid the $ 7\/month rental fee from Comcast for their lousy equipment . I got this up and running with a short phone call to Comcast technical support so they can enter the modem 's MAC address into their system . The setup is easy ; the indicator lights on the front are fairly intuitive so you have an idea what the problem is if your internet is n't working quite the way it should . The modem can also be accessed from any web browser on a computer on the local network -LRB- ... -RRB- , providing lots of information about the quality of your internet connection , system uptime , etc. . This was helpful information when I did have an issue with intermittent internet outages and I was able to report this to Comcast to get the problem fixed -LRB- it was a problem on their end , not with the Motorola SURFboard -RRB- . Good price now , too ! This will pay for itself in under a year of use . 	Cable Modem
Works great . No need to spend 80 $ at best buy whne you can spend 30 and get the exact same function . 	Cable Modem
Had it installed with Comcast service , and it works flawlessly so far . I used it with a Medialink router , and everything was compatible right out of the box . If I have any problems with the modem I 'll update , but so far it is performing as advertised and there were no problems with installation 	Cable Modem
I do n't get why all these people are having problems installing this . Electronic things are not my forte . I am the `` hit the big button '' type . You disconnect your current modem . You put this one in , in it 's place . it does have its own power cord , so you will need to climb under\/around the desk to get that squared away . It turns on . Call your cable company , they need some numbers off of the included paperwork . They do their thing . They may ask you to unplug the power supply from the back of it , so go ahead and do that . They will tell you when to plug it back in , so do that too . Voil&agrave; ! I am a 64 yr old grandmother with Comcast Cable . My friend who is 72 and has Charter did the same thing . 	Cable Modem
Just wanted to send a warning out there for people like me who are not tech savvy with modems - I found out the hard and long way that this modem will NOT work if you have Comcast internet and telephone . It only has a cable jack and an Ethernet jack -LRB- the Ethernet cable is the cable that runs from your computer or router to the modem -RRB- . For Comcast voice , you need a telephony cable modem that has a cable jack , Ethernet jack , AND a phone jack . I discovered after a visit to Frys that 99.9 % of the cable modems do not have phone jacks - 3 of the 4 salespeople I spoke with had never even heard of one having a phone jack . However , the Best Buys that have a Comcast installation center in them DO sell the special telephony cable modem -LRB- brand is Arris -RRB- , but it costs $ 150 . I 'm sure I could have found one cheaper online , but I was pretty done with it by then . The rental fee for the Arris modem through Comcast is $ 7 a month . It would take over 21 months of rental fees to pay off the $ 150 price , and by then something new would be on the market . So I just bit the bullet and rented from Comcast . Hope this info saves someone else a day of frustration . 	Cable Modem
My cable provider upgraded our local cable service to DOCSIS 3.0 and the Motorola SURFboard SB6121 was the top choice on their list of compatible modems . We have not been disappointed . It has worked like a champ . 	Cable Modem
I ordered a Motorola SB6121 SURFboard DOCSOS 3.0 Cable Modem to use with Comcast in Oregon . The modem has had no problems since I 've acquired it . It is easy to use , compatible with Comcast , and works . The LEDs are shaped and colour-coded , adding to its usability . I was able to get high speeds -LRB- over 20 MB -RRB- using this modem , though that has more to do with Comcast than it does with the modem itself . I have been using this modem for approximately a month ; so far I am completely satisfied with my purchase . 	Cable Modem
I was looking to reduce my monthly cable\/internet bill at home so I cancel my modem rental from the cable company . I bought this , plugged it in , and it just worked . It 's been about a year and I have n't had to unplug it since I first powered it on . It 's also paid for itself already . Stick it to the -LRB- cable -RRB- man ... cancel your cable modem rental and get one of these . 	Cable Modem
"<ahref=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B006IJHK96/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/180-4424144-2002963""> Linksys DOCSIS 3.0 Cable Modem -LRB- DPC3008-CC -RRB- </a> After a great deal of research for my circumstances , this specific cable modem is my best available option as a `` supported device '' with Comcast , my Internet Service Provider -LRB- ISP -RRB- . Amazon Prime offered a competitive price -LRB- since increased -RRB- . The order arrived on time along with another Amazon order placed later that arrived a day early . If you are a basic internet service consumer , you probably are not shopping for a DOCSIS 3.0 cable modem . If you want the best `` bang for your buck '' and need fast internet access say for video on demand or online gaming , read on . Bottom line , this Cisco DPC3800-CC cable modem works on my Comcast service . It does not operate at DOCSIS 3.0 speeds . My quantifiable thru put is now more than doubled by replacing a leased DOCSIS 2 cable modem with this DOCSIS 3 modem . The pay back is 12.2 months by eliminating the Comcast modem lease . My disappointment rests with Comcast , not this product . Here is why . While the FCC wants US ISPs to make 100 million bits per second -LRB- 100 Mbps -RRB- download speed our national standard by 2020 , we are FAR from that standard in 2012 . A cable internet provider that implements the full feature set of the cable industry 's DOCSIS 3.0 standard could meet the FCC objective . But my service provider is not even close and has no incentive to do so . All we can do , as consumers footing the bill , is to be informed -LRB- search `` DOCSIS 3.0 '' -RRB- and purchase products that will work if the service level is provided . You need to understand that there are three variables to your quality of internet service : 1 -RRB- cooperative manufacturer \/ service provider relationships to assure proper `` provisioning '' or the ` hand shake ' between the hardware and the ISP ; 2 -RRB- an ISP willing to implement a supportive infrastructure ; and 3 -RRB- the ISP service level and equipment you select to pay for . I chose the Cisco DPC3008-CC to address factors 1 and 3 and understand that Comcast is not now providing adequate service to my location to achieve service levels this cable modem is designed to provide . In other words , I can not downgrade the DPC3008 device due to my ISP service , factor 2 ! I moved from NW FL to SW Florida a few months ago in 2012 . With the same hardware -LRB- a DOCSIS 2 Scientific Atlanta cable modem -RRB- , different cable providers -LRB- Cox & Comcast -RRB- I had 2x faster thru put with Cox cable than I now have with Comcast with the same modem . A personal visit to Comcast 's local service office confirmed yesterday that my location is not receiving the highest speeds Comcast offers here . In contrast , I received better than advertised thru put from Cox -LRB- try 32 Mbps with the same DOCSIS 2 device ! -RRB- . The installation was simple . The CD based user guides are not clear . Yes , you can just attach the new cable modem to your cable without wasting time to call technical support , assuming your cable internet is operable . Keep your working cable modem until you set up your new one . As per the user guide , simply connect the new modem and power it up . Observe the lights to confirm the new modem on your cable initiated your ISP 's automatic provisioning . Now , direct connect your computer to the modem , power cycle the modem and open your browser . You eventually will see a screen that requests your account number and registered phone number , maybe the last 4 digits of your SSNO . After a reset , I was good to go . The last install step is to then connect your wired \/ wireless local area network . You can do this within 30 minutes . After testing that , I drove to Comcast , turned in the leased cable modem and challenged their service level to no avail . I will edit this review later if I experience any issue specific to the Cisco DPC3008-CC . I conclude that the negative reviews here are from inexperienced users or perhaps a firmware or provisioning issue now corrected by Comcast and Cisco . After 24 hours , it is still working and never rebooted . If a user does not properly `` provision '' the new modem with the ISP , it will exhibit the reboot symptom complained about here . I deduce that the Comcast recommended speed test site -LRB- Speedtest.net -RRB- is optimized for my local Comcast service since its measured speeds with two different cable modems were nearly twice that of a different site -LRB- Speakeasy.net -RRB- . Within 24 hours , I ran 4 tests of the two different sites . With Speedtest.net , my download \/ upload average speeds were 15.4 \/ 6.2 Mbit\/sec with the DOCIS 2 device versus 28.4 \/ 5.3 with the Cisco DOCSIS DPC3800 . With Speakeasy.net , the averages were 7.0 \/ 6.0 before versus 28.4 \/ 4.0 with the Cisco modem . Clearly , the Cisco DPC3008 DOCSIS 3 cable modem performed better than a Scientific Atlanta DOCSIS 2 cable modem . Is the expected DOCSIS 3 speed attained ? NO. . If you read all the above , you understand that I hold Comcast accountable , not this device from Cisco . Am I obtaining the DOCSIS 3 benefit of 8\/4 dynamic channel bonding ? There is no way to tell , except my speed test suggest NO. . I do not now know if that is hardware or an ISP issue . Yes I am receiving the DOCSIS 3.0 benefits of IPv6 and a gigabit Ethernet port . Yes , the setup was easy . I chose the Cisco DPC3008 primarily due to its DOCSIS 3.0 certification and its acceptance as an approved device by Comcast . Comcast has few DOCSIS 3.0 devices on its approval list that are still marketed by the manufacturer for consumer purchase with the 8 \/ 4 channel bonding and IPv6 features of DOCSIS 3 . The newer Cisco DPC3010 and newer devices from several manufactures are not yet approved so I stuck with the older DPC3008 . Why Comcast seems to need 4 years to certify a device , six years after DOCSIS 3 is defined is unfathomable . Cisco seems to have gone the extra mile to assure its device is acceptable to Comcast , factor 1 above . This specific cable modem is my best available option today and it works . "	Cable Modem
I ordered the used Netgear cable modem so I do n't have to keep paying the monthly Comcast lease charge . The modem arrived just five days after I ordered it via priority mail from California to my home in Massachusetts , which made me happy . But as soon as I received the box I noticed the contents were rattling around inside . To my surprise and alarm , there was NO packing material in the box when I opened it . You would think the seller would pack the modem carefully to prevent any damage in transit , especially since it is a used modem . I intend to install the modem later today and I 'm hoping it works properly . To be continued ... Well , despite the modem being on Comcast 's approved modem list , the techs could n't get it to register with their system . I 'm going to try again tomorrow and ask for a higher tier technician .

Had some initial setup issues , but it turns out it was Comcast . This modem runs like a champ . I 'm getting 50 + MBPs download -LRB- what I pay for -RRB- and setup was simple . It 's also aesthetically pleasing . . The modem is small and can be inconspicuous of placed properly . 	Cable Modem
"When I had my cable installed I knew the moment the tech pulled out an outdated RCA modem I needed to upgrade . The ridiculously slow speeds coming from said modem further proved my suspicions . I started researching modems and came to the conclusion it is a 50\/50 crap shoot ... either it will work for you or it wo n't . I chose to look at Cisco because I already owned a Cisco router , <ahref=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003B4AVSS/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/179-9894279-9674648""> Cisco-Valet Plus Wireless Router </a> which has yet to let me down and I wanted to stick with the same brand for my modem . I am really glad I did . Setting up the Cisco Linksys modem was so easy , I 've never had a modem\/router set-up so fast and easily . All I did was plug everything in , swap it out with my cable company online , and voila I was online ... and my online speeds jumped from a crawl of 2.5 mbps ... to blazing fast speeds of 12mbps and up . If you are having problems with your cable internet speeds , odds are its the modem they provided you with . I dumped my cable originally because of lousy speeds , and went back out of necessity . If I had known I could have resolved my issue with a new modem I would have done this years ago , and saved myself countless hours of customer service calls . "	Cable Modem
I recently got Comcast Internet and wanted to own my own cable modem instead of paying Comcast every month to rent one . Everything went well had to contact Comcast with Mac ID and Serial # but after setting everything up my modem kept cycling through and the Comcast guy said my modem would go online and then go offline . He thought I had a faulty modem and they were going to charge me $ 50 to send a rep out to check if it was a line problem or a modem problem . Luckly I googled the problem and found that these modems sometimes have a problem with receiving too powerful a signal from the cable line and said an attenuator or cable line splitter would do the trick . So I had a line splitter that took the 1 line and split it into 3 seperate lines and then it worked perfectly with a less powerful signal . Everything works perfectly now and the modem is great but I am surprised Comcast did n't suggest to try this since it is an issue that is known . 	Cable Modem
This linksys cable modem by Cisco is great , it definitely bumped up the internet speed , my wireless internet connections are steady and excellent . 	Cable Modem
The set-up was easy , a no brainer . I can now surf at faster speeds that Comcast has upgraded me to . 	Cable Modem
i bought this item i got tired of paying my cable provider for the basic modem they provide you . . so i decide it to try the motorola sb6121 and when i got it install it actually increase my internet speed is really stable it does what it was meant for . . i highly recommend it ... 	Cable Modem
Nothing like going with the standard in modems , Motorola . I was getting 25mbps with the old standard DOCSIS model now I get 34mbps . The blinking blue light when your router connects seems backwards since all the other lights are solid when eveything is good but just something small no big deal you just need to remember that the bottom light blinking is a good thing but if the others blink it is not . 	Cable Modem
The product was delivered in only 3 days . What great service . The Cable Modem was easy to install , one call to COMCAST and the modem was up and running . Been working great since the day I installed it . 	Cable Modem
Everyone else has this pretty well covered ... Unless you want to try something cheaper and deal with delays and returns , this is the way to go for weak cable reception . Total home run . 	Cable Modem
This amp does not work with the latest cable modems such as Motorola SB 6120 . The amplifier definitely boosts the TV signal as I can verify that signal-to-noise ratio increased from around 32 dB to 40 dB . However , the amp seems to either block full bi-directional communication or filters out required frequency for the cable modem to make online connection to ISP -LRB- in my case Comcast -RRB- . Furthermore , the vendor 's -LRB- cabletvamps.com -RRB- 's support is a joke . When I asked why it was not working with my cable modem , the reply was a copy\/paste of some unrelated topic about the amp not supporting satellite TV and I should return the product . Main reason I purchased the booster was to split to both cable modem and TV without dropping signal strength to the cable modem , but that is NOT possible with this junk . I am back to using a simple -3.5 db splitter that supports upto 1,000 MHz Update ! - The CableTVAmps support finally replied : Quote : `` The Motorola S2 is a Passive Return Unit - these are not designed to be used with Cable Modems as they will not support the signal . You will need an Active Return Amplifier -LRB- the Motorola K4 is a 4-port unit -RRB- which will support a Cable Modem and any interactive services -LRB- OnDemand , etc. -RRB- that the Cable Company offers '' 	Cable Modem
I have had a DOCSIS 2.0 Scientific Atlanta DPC2100R2 for many years now . It has worked like a charm . Recently in my infinite wisdom , I decided to upgrade to a 3.0 modem and chose the Linksys DPC3008 . I chose it mostly for its small footprint and the lack of the need of a fan so that it would go into my structured wiring closet . Installation was pretty smooth and the new speeds looked impressive . I was real happy till I found that it drops the link every 15 minutes , this is driving my teenager crazy . Google search reveals that a number of people are having similar problems . Cisco says it is Comcast 's fault , Comcast says it is the modem 's fault . The modem is rated 3.0 \/ 3.0 by Comcast and is certified by them . Will have to return the modem and go back to my slower but reliable Scientific Atlanta DPC2100r2 . 	Cable Modem
Bought this unit as it was on the recommended list of Comcast . Better to buy the unit then pay Comcast $ 7\/month to lease it . Many positive reviews . Hooked it up to my Netgear router , contacted Comcast and gave them the numbers required for them to activate . Up in running in less than 30 minutes . Highly recommend . 	Cable Modem
Owning your own modem is the smart way to go . Comcast was charging us $ 5 a month to rent one , it took just 8 months to save money with this modem . -LRB- This modem was on sale when I bought it -RRB- This is the most reliable cable modem I 've ever used . I 've had it for about two years now and it 's still going strong . I ca n't think of the last time I had a network problem that was the fault of the modem . I do n't even reset the modem anymore when having problems , since it 's always the router . Pretty amazing for a refurbished modem . It 's a shame Linksys brand routers are n't this dependable . If they were I 'd be a very happy camper . One downside : This modem uses the aging DOCSIS 2 standard , which does n't support IPv6 . When ISPs start to roll out IPv6 you wo n't be able to take advantage of it with the CM100 . It does n't matter at all for normal people because IPv6 support wo n't be \* required \* for many , many years , but if you 're a techie like me and you want IPv6 ASAP , you 're better off getting a modem that supports it .

I received the package yesterday and had this modem working inside of 20 minutes . I simply unhooked my old modem and followed the steps to hook this one up . I ran the installation guide CD and when I was done it displayed the ` Mac '' address , told me that Comcast will need it and directed me to call them for activation . After the usual 10 minutes of them trying to get me to NOT talk to a real person I finally got someone on the line who asked me for the Mac address and boom everything worked perfectly . I then plugged the Ethernet cable back into my wireless router and the three lap tops , a couple of Roku 's , a Blu Ray player and the wireless printer all worked great . I am not one to constantly check download speeds but I was getting some download interruptions with the last modem so I wanted to replace it with a newer model . Time will tell but so far I am very pleased with this item and for the price it is a super deal . For my application this gets 5 stars Amazon is incredible but you need to be on your toes . I had this item in my Cart and was ready to purchase it for $ 54.49 . Somehow I deleted it from my Cart and ran a new search and came up with this exact same item in a so-called Environmentally Safe box for $ 29.00 . There must be a catch . I had momentary buyer 's remorse when I was waiting on the line with Comcast but absolutely not an issue . No catch and I saved $ 25 . Remember this is a 2.0 DOCSIS modem not the 3.0 high speed one . I do not pay Comcast for their high speed internet service and my research said I do not need the 3.0 for the level of service that I have with them . So for about $ 30 you can own your own cable modem , eliminate the monthly rental fee and pay this off in about three or four months . March 23rd update-I noticed that the price has gone up from $ 29 to $ 44.99 since I bought this -- now only $ 10 savings 	Cable Modem
Comcast in the San Francisco area is my cable and internet provider . I have rented their modem at $ 3 a month for many years . They did me a favor when it was announced that they would be increasing their modem rental to $ 5 a month ! I bought the Linksys CM 100 Cable Modem , made by Cisco , after reading a review of how good it worked with Comcast , with faster speed than when using the Comcast modems . Installation was easy , BUT , remember to unplug your router if you have one , and plug the modem directly into your computer for installation . It would have been nice if the installations directions and CD which came with the modem made that very clear , because , even though I showed connectivity , when I called Comcast to give them the MAC number and get my new modem registered with them , I could not get a browser to open up . Comcast has always been very helpful if I have ever had a connectivity problem , and that was the first question they asked : Did I have a router ? Once I disconnected the router and reinstalled the modem with the CD , which took 2 minutes , Comcast got me online and my browser came up right away , and I reconnected my router with no problems since . In less than a year at $ 5 a month my modem will have paid for itself with the one time cost . I am very happy with it , and thank Comcast for saving me money in this regard ! 	Cable Modem
I bought this modem to replace the Ambit cable modem that I was renting from the cable company -LRB- Broadstripe -RRB- . Not only will this modem save me money but it seems to have increased my download speeds during peak hours from 1Mbps to 5Mbps . Overall great product ! 	Cable Modem
ISP : Comcast Comcast Internet Package : Performance -LRB- 15 Mbps -RRB- Comcast provided modem : Their `` latest DOCSIS 3.0 Arris '' modem Router : Linksys E4200 v1 The reason why I bought this modem was simple ... why pay $ 7\/month to rent a modem when I can buy one myself , with potentially better specs , and cost savings 10 months out . I found good reviews for this modem and figured why not , especially since http:\/\/mydeviceinfo.comcast.net\/ shows that this specific modem is signed off as supported by Comcast , along with their highest , 3-star rating . I ca n't be certain that the new Motorola modem is buying me speed\/reliability over the Arris modem , but I know that my wife and I have been running our computers and game consoles without a hitch . With the Arris modem , we found the internet to slow down several times a week requiring modem reboots , but maybe we 're just getting lucky . But hey , possible positives are a good thing right ? I 'm paying for Comcast 's performance package which claims speeds of 15 Mbps down . With the Arris I was seeing speeds around ~ 17-25 Mbps down . With the new Motorola I 'm seeing 20-25 Mbps down -LRB- both much higher than expected -RRB- . I 've seen slow uploads with both modems , but I think that 's a Comcast thing . -LRB- random : I previously had FiOS 25\/25 and was getting 30\/25 . those were the good ol' days -RRB- If you 're using this with Comcast , remember that you 're going to have to contact customer service and get them to send a signal to your new modem in order for it to work - do n't expect it to be plug-n-play .

Works out of the box . It 's just a bit expensive . Compared to the other rated modems out there . The LEDs are too bright . 	Cable Modem
I had a cable coming in to an internet router , and I wanted to split it to a television . This was easy to set up and works great ! It was a little freaky hooking up the power cable -LRB- uses coax cable -RRB- -LRB- not supplied -RRB- , but the signal strength to the HD tv is strong , and I have n't noticed any adverse issues with the internet . 	Cable Modem
It is everything they said it would be . Arrived on time , correct cost and funtions fine . Tip , you may have to call your cable company and give them the MAC address to work . 	Cable Modem
I bought a refurbished Linksys CM100 because my ISP decided to go up on the rental even for modems already installed , which makes no sense whatsoever as they have already purchased the modems and there is no associated monthly expense other than an occasional replacement , just pure profit for them . For six months ' rental I could buy this refurb , so I did . I hope everyone does the same thing and `` sticks it to the man '' as young people say these days . My only real complaint about the modem is the same as with other similar modems : no power switch so you have to unplug it to turn it off and the LEDs are very bright at night and I find that annoying . As far as minor issues , the enclosed disc is not for OSX , only Windows -LRB- not that it was needed -RRB- and the MAC address is printed so small that I had to use a magnifying glass and a bright light to read it . If you do n't get the MAC address right when you call your ISP , it wo n't work at all . As a tip , the letters are slightly taller than the numbers so it is easy to tell a 0 from an O -- with the magnifying glass . The packing is secure with the components in a pulpboard tray inside two cardboard boxes . It actually looks new and if it had n't said on the package it was a refurb , I would n't have known . The cables provided are new , not sure about the power supply , looks new but who knows . Aesthetically , it has a small footprint and no extraneous design features , which I appreciate . My ISP 's tech support had some difficulty getting me online with the new modem but it was all their fault and had nothing to do with the modem itself . At first he said the problem must be with the modem but I insisted that he double check and he `` ran diagnostics '' and kept me on hold for fifteen minutes and then all was well after a restart of the modem and the computer . I did n't make him explain what the problem was since I was just glad the problem was resolved and I had wasted enough time . The entire call lasted exactly sixty minutes ! A speed test shows I am getting the full speed subscribed to so no complaints on that -- it works just fine . Before purchasing this modem I did talk with my ISP tech support to confirm it was compatible . They are switching over to DOCSIS 3.0 for higher speeds but he said for anything under 10 Mbps , DOCSIS 2.0 would continue to work fine indefinitely . Still , check with your ISP to be sure . My provider is RCN and they did not list this modem but he said any DOCSIS 2.0 modem would be fine . I was careful to purchase from a dealer who offered a seven day return as many sellers force you to deal with Linksys for warranty issues even if it is DOA . I do suspect that many people who complain on the internet that these refurbs do n't work just have a problem on the ISP end like what I went through . In the end , though , for the price of a new one you could easily buy two refurbs so what do you have to lose ? 	Cable Modem
"I installed my new Motorola SB6121 Cable Modem today . The cable connection and bootup of the modem completed without a hitch and I contacted Xfinity Cable -LRB- Comcast -RRB- and spoke with an internet specialist who took my HFC MAC ID numbers and my Customer Serial Number off the box . After rebooting the modem and router -LRB- WRT54GL -RRB- , I brought up the computer . At first I could not connect to the internet , but after I changed my LAN address it came up okay . The reason it did n't come up right away was that the cable guy reset my router and the settings were all set back to the default . Fortunately I had saved my router settings prior to contacting Xfinity and when I restored them back to the settings I had , everything worked perfectly . So be sure if you are using a router that you save your favorite settings before you do this modem change . It can be a real pain trying to remember all the settings in the router that you may have changed over the years . By the way , I never connected to the computer first . Modem , Router and Computer were all connected initially but were booted in that order . So far everything now is working fine and I hope that continues . A bit too early to say how this will work out over time , but at least it 's saving me $ 7 a month for the time being . By the way , the Xfinity guy was great , polite and very knowledgeable . Good luck . UPDATE : It 's been about a month since I wrote the above review and since that time the modem has worked flawlessly . I know some folks said there 's had run very warm , but I did n't find that to be true . My modem is only slightly warm to the touch , but a whole lot cooler than a lot of my other electronic devices . As far as I 'm concerned , this is an excellent modem and is working well with my Xfinity -LRB- Comcast -RRB- account . Download speed 20MB and upload speed 4MB . Ca n't beat that in my book . Sure beats the lousy DSL service I previously had . <ahref=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004XC6GJ0/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/191-9041100-4330654""> Motorola SB6121 SURFboard DOCSIS 3.0 Cable Modem </a> "	Cable Modem

This is a great camera for the price . It has many useful functions that use to cost quite a bit more . The only problem I have with it is that you have to charge the battery on the camera itself . I 'm sure this was just a way for Sony to cut their cost , and get people to buy more charger accessories . This kind of annoyed me when I opened the box , but the rest of the camera is great .

This is the best camcorder I have ever seen . By far the best feature on it is the NightShot which lights up the area you are filming just like a flashlight would do except if your are being filmed you ca n't see the light . Also the camera feature is just like having a $ 300 digital camera built in that is how good the digital pictures are . The Memory Stick for the camera part of the camcorder is very small but a little pricey . The only bad thing about this camcorder is the software that comes with it which makes it hard to download pictures . 	Camcorder
I 've am sony fan since last 5 years when I bought my first sony digital camera . I am also satisfied with the camcoder . Features I love in CX150 are : Ease of use Light weight Touch Screen 25X Optical Zoom Image Stabilization Smile Detection Can take picture while shooting Can take picture from captured recording Can be converted to MPEG format which can be played by windows media player Full HD recording Good image quality Custom settings Features I do not appreciate : Can not record well in low light even with its Low Lux technology .

I bought one of the refurbished my old handycam and I really like this one . Great Videos and simple use . I miss the old night shot from my handycam , but this one is good in low light conditions . Battery seems to last a long time . I have been trying to find a HDMI cord for this camera . You have to order a special one b\/c the connection end to the camera is a smaller type connection . Overall I am very please and glad I got the refurbished one and saved money . 	Camcorder
If you buy this camera , make sure you use it in various settings BEFORE the return period is over . This thing is the WORST . The videos and photos both are grainy - on `` high '' quality setting . This is extremely unacceptable , I have never had such an awful Sony product . The Sony Cybershots I have takes better video than this - and one of them is only 2MP , so that is saying something . The only good things ? It 's small . And the zoom is fast . Big deal . If the picture 's grainy , who cares ? It also came without the USB cord . You ca n't get photos off the internal memory without one . Beware , beware , beware . 	Camcorder
I reviewed this product on UTube before purchasing it for my son who travels alot . he loves it , nice pics and video , lots of features such as : can add music to your video , purchase the tripod and hard case . Easy to handle , fits in palm of your hand , so much to tell . Love this product , you will have fun with it . Excellent video footage , hook it the the TV by additional cables you must purchase and view your vacation for your family from the tv . Must purchase the cables for that and extra sim cards , worth every bit of it for the perfect entertainment ever . highly recommend it , my son is pleased and so am I ; it was a gift and I made the right choice .

This is a great camera !! ... I 've had NO problems with this camera . I 'll admit that it 's kind of pointless to have a 700x zoom and it does n't work to well after about 400x , but who needs that much zoom anyways . This camera is far better than our last SONY camcorder which was about 12 or 13 years old . It was good at the time , but technology changes . The picture is great quality and the feature that includes editing on the computer is great ! The night-vision feature comes in handy too . The only thing I partially agree with , that the other reviewer stated , is that the tape release button is on the bottom , so this could make it hard if you are using a tripod , but I have n't used a tripod yet with this camera , and I would assume that you could easily insert a new tape . Overall , I HIGHLY-RECOMMEND this camcorder . 	Camcorder
I used this camera to take close-up pictures easily at the US Grand Prix Pit Walkabout today and I found it outstanding . Even from distances as far as 100 feet , you can zoom in far enough to see very detailed parts of the cars , like small wires used for telemetry . I highly recommend it , although the battery life is incredibly short and there is next to no space -LRB- 8MB -RRB- on the card I got with it . But this is to be expected . 	Camcorder
I believe this camara is a very decent camara for the first time camara holder . It has many good features like a still shot and recorder . You can even use the voice recorder to speak your mind . Also , the mp3 player can play clear , crisp sound . However , the mp3 player does not play WMA . Also , depending on your scenary , pictures come out dark in some instances . Although , I still strongly suggest that you purchace this device . 	Camcorder
I purchased this camcorder for my Mother for Mother 's Day . She found it extremely easy and practical to use . We made tons and tons of home movies and sent them to the rest of our family .

To tranfer video to a PC you need a Firewire port on the PC -LRB- I use the one on my sound card -RRB- and a firewire cable . I got the cable at Circuit City when I bought the camera . If you have Windows XP , Movie Maker will open by default when you connect the camera . If you want to purchase DV editing software , Pinnacle 's Studio DV comes with a firewire card . 	Camcorder
If you 're a gadget person , you 'll love this . If you 're looking to film the next `` Titanic '' , do n't buy it . It 's great fun , easy to use but it is not an $ 800 camcorder . I suggest rechargeable batteries though , it goes through the regular pretty quick -- especially if you play with it as much as I do . The video can be dark indoors so turn on the lights !!

I am extremely displeased with the life of this product . I shot about 20 hours of footage with it and it no longer works . Do n't buy this camcorder . 	Camcorder
I must say when I bought the $ 400 camera that it would n't compare to , say , Canon or other big name digital cameras . I 've already edited several videos on my computer that I imported from this JVC . Color me impressed ! It is very full featured for such a low cost camera . I 've used it several times already and am VERY happy with the results . It 's a good camera with suprisingly good quality . Go for it ! 	Camcorder

We bought the JVC GR-DVL505U Digital Camcorder a couple of years ago . The first year was great . It did what it 's supposed to do . That 's why I still give it some stars . <p> But on the second year , it started flashing a lot of error messages , constantly ask to clean head , and sometimes DID NOT record at all without any indication on the screen . We found out later when we tried to view the tapes . At first , we thought it was just a bad tape , but it happened to every single tape . In one of the tapes , we found more than half blank\/skipped sections . It 's so sad and frustrating because we 're trying to record our baby 's ` first everything ' . <p> We 're planning to get a new one . We can no longer depend on this camcorder to capture the important moments . I guess 2 stars is too generous because I would n't recommend this product to anyone . 	Camcorder
The best thing about this Camcorder is that it has a 4 inchesscreen ! It 's big enough that you can show your video to other peoplewithout connect the camcorder to the TV . It 's really nice ! I have seen other people 's camcorders with a tiny 2 inches screen , and that 's no good for your enjoyment at all . ------------- The night vision is amazing too ! After you turned the night vision on , you can take pictures in total darkest . And the picture is really good . ------------ The picture quality is great too . Very clear ! But it did n't come out too good after I converted the 8mm tape into VCR tape . ------------ Reviews on Amazon said that Digital Camcorders 's audio has CD quality , but I really did n't notice anything . I mean you really do n't care too much about the audio if you are just video taping a family vacation or something . ---------- Something bad about the Camcorder . ---------- Because of the big screen and it 's not Mini-DV , so it 's a bit heavy . You will probably get very tired after holding the Camcorder for more than a hour . So if you are a weak person , try a Mini-DV camcorder with a smaller screen so that you wo n't have any arm problems . ------------ Another thing was that I thought I was going to be able to connect my camcorder to my Dell computer , but it did n't work at all . Be sure that you have an interface card if you want to use it with a computer . But I really do n't see any point to edit your films on the computer , I am too busy for that , and I am not trying to make a public film , my film does n't need to be perfectly edited . And also , I also thought that when I zoom in the camcorder , it could reach 35mm or something , but that did n't happen . Beware ! Camcorders do not have a wide-angle view ! you wo n't be able to tape the whole view , only partly . I think the minimal range of this camcorder is only 50mm . Just be careful . Do n't be disappointed . END 	Camcorder
The DCR-TR7000 is a great camcorder if you can find it at a resonable price . The DCR-TR7000 has all the features of the higher priced Sony Camcorders minus one option - the view window .

To be honest , I had set my expectations a bit too high and was somewhat disappointed by the image quality . For instance , I had my eye on a digital camera -LRB- for stills -RRB- as well as a camcorder . So I thought I 'd combine the two in a single purchase . Well , guess what ! This little baby offers less than 1 megapixel -LRB- Mp -RRB- , while the cheapest digital camera offers at least 1.3 Mp , with many models offering 3.3 and I 've even seen ads offering 5 Mp . Second -LRB- incorrect -RRB- expectation was video quality . I used to own a VHS-C and after all the hype I 'd heard about about digital , I was expecting perfect video , the same quality you get on , say , the Discovery Channel . Wrong again . Although the quality is an order of magnitude better than my old VHS-C . So , having said all that why did I rate this camera 4 stars ? Because it is a great camera - for the money . Yes you can get camcorders with 1.5 Mp stills , the Sony DCR-TRV30 for example , but they cost ... more . Not worth that extra money ... As for the video quality ? Like I said - much , MUCH better than the older VHS-C quality I used to have . The colors are great , you can make infinite copies without loss of quality -LRB- that 's digital for you -RRB- and I 've been playing with video editing software on the PC and the resulting videos are awesome and fun . Furthermore , JVC has done a great job on the user interface to set and control its enormous amount of features . They are menu-driven which leaves the camera refreshingly clean of `` buttons '' . This can be a big issue if you have `` fat fingers '' or are someone who can get lost in too many buttons -LRB- check out some of the other camcorders and you 'll know what I mean -RRB- . So in summary , if you set your expectations right , this is a great camera with solid image quality for its price , is very rich in features and comes at a good price . Four stars in my book .

My camera has been down to Key West for a short film shoot . Not a problem it produced the most vivid clearity one could imagine . Also shot footage for The Discovery channel with this camera last month with pro-qaulity . <p> DVD burns complement this camera this camera looses not one bit of qaulity when editing . Esspecially if you have a good enhancement program youll love the results the Xl1s produces bump up the saturation and the colors jump out ... <p> I have shot with about every camera out there and the Xl1s beat em all hands down on weight and ease of use . Picture qaulity is by far the best .500 + hours on my Xl1s and it works better than new . You know , you have to read the manual to adjust for lighting conditions other than that I can produce a great film feel to my work with this DV camera . A must for the person looking to make his mark in the business . Dont settle for a gl2 or a panasonic , you 'll know what Im talking about once you shoot with this unbelieveable camera . <p> One thing this camera is very stable , and with practice youll throw away your tripod ... You , Gotta practice camera technique people ... If you have the cash this is your camera . . 	Camcorder
I was so excited on Christmas morning when I got a new Camcorder , It was my daughters first Christmas where she would be able to open her own presents , and the camera was not what I expected , it was very grainy and did not focus very well . In a low lit room you could not make out who were recording , I was trying to video people in the room and if there were two or more people in the shot it would only try to focus -LRB- and not very well -RRB- on one person . I will be returning this camera and hopefully getting a better one -RRB- 	Camcorder
I was deciding what type of camcorder to get and did n't want to spend more than $ 600 on the good stuff nor $ 200 on some cheap miniDV . I read about the Canon elura 100 many times but the camcorder was out for 1yr already . I wanted to get the latest and greatest thus I purchasing a basic Panasonic DVD camcorder -LRB- D230 -RRB- ... boy was that a mistake ... I thought I can record onto dvd , pop it in my dvd player and start watching it , or copy the dvd video -LRB- vob -RRB- onto my desktop for editing , but NOoo , it does n't work like that . After you finish recording the DVD you have to finalize within your camcorder while it is plugged in -LRB- wo n't finalize if not plugged in -RRB- , the process takes about 10-15min for a 30min footage , and the finalized DVD is not recognizable by the PC , so you 'll end up with tons of DVD-Rs . -LRB- no sure if this is true for all dvd camcorder or just the panasonic one I got -RRB- Anyhow , I decided to go back to miniDV -LRB- can transfer to the PC , easier to edit , superior video quality compared to DVD and HD camcorders and more compact -RRB- I wanted to get the Elura but it was discounted , and all the new Canon MiniDV 's had worst video performance than the Elura -LRB- based on numerous reviews -RRB- . Also , none of them had 2 LED -LRB- do n't do much but better than nothing -RRB- and built in lenses cover . I was torn . After researching some more I found out about the new Sony DCR-HC48 . It is about the same price point as the Elura , about the same size , similar CCD , got a sliding lense cover and it can record in infrared -LRB- which I thought was pretty cool -RRB- ! I end up buying a refurbished Elura online and a brand new HC48 at local store . First thing I did was to test for motor noise since so many people complain about it . I took both camcorder to the bathroom where the echo is loudest and recorded 1 min footage on each . I then played it back on both camcorder with volume turned to the highest , to my surprise the Sony camcorder actually had much louder motor noise than the Canon . The Sony had a loud motor noise while the Canon had a light whirling noise . The canon 's video performance was also better , with more accurate color and auto focus . The infrared on the Sony was fun for 5min , but I do n't see any particle use for it -LRB- unless you either want to create some Pariz Hiltxn video with glowing green eyes , or if you want to record someone in the dark without the person knowing , but keep in mind the range of the infrared LED is about the same as a regular white LED , the camcorder needs to be 3feet away from the subject in order to illuminate it in infrared -RRB- Anyhow , I kept the refurbished Canon and am happy with the decision . Oh did I also mention that the Elura is the most compact miniDV camcorder in the market ? the major downside of the Elura is that is has been discontinued and only refurbished units are available online now .

I just received my Sony Camera HDR-CX110 . The main problem is that this camera has not an internal memoryt , so you have to expend additional USD 100 for a decent flash card 32G memory , despite the fact the camera has good image quality , it only have 3.1 Megapixel for still images , what a disapointment . For only additional USD40 you can buy a Sony HDR-CX150 , 25x optical zoom with internal memory of 16G ; even the older version of Sony HDR-CX 100 is better , internal memory of 8G and 4 Megapixel still images . I felt robbed by Sony with this `` new version videocamera of HDR-CX100 '' DO N'T BUY IT , SONY SCAMS YOU WITH THIS MODEL , I will go for a CANON , at least they do n't scam you !! 	Camcorder
"</div> <spanclass=""tiny""> Length : : 3:12 Mins </span> I 'm disappointed in Sony 's response to my camera 's errors . I would expect a much better response . `` Buffer Overflow '' problem , along with lost data . Hard drive errors . I would not recommend anyone to purchase this camera . "	Camcorder
This digital camera has it all . It records in a digital format ... on regular 8mm tapes . So there is no need to try and find any miniDV cartridges . The picture quality is excellent . It also has a `` night vision '' capability ! The only thing I do n't like is the price . It could go for less . 	Camcorder
After graduating from the Sony FX11 8M -LRB- top of the line in it 's time -RRB- to the TRV310 the only real noticible difference was the picture sharpness , color left a little to be desired . What really upset me was the grain i was getting in different lighting situations . My old Sony 8M w\/1 lux was superior in this respect . Not pleased at all I took it back and purchased the TRV87 Hi8 which replaces the famed TRV66 . . Same camera except the TRV87 plays Standard 8M tapes as well as Hi8 . In comparison to the digital8 310 model , the picture clarity\/sound were the same , the Hi8 had truer color reproduction , longer battery life , longer recording times and is superior in filming in low light conditions with it 's 0.7 Minimum lux compared to the 4.0 minimum lux of the Digital8 cameras . Forget the Nightshot feature on both cameras , horrible . So , in my opinion the Sony TRV87 Hi8 , you get an overall superior camera with a proven track record . The Digital 8 models definately needs improving to exceed the Hi8 in overall performance to warrant their higher price . BTW , I just love the TRV87 , an awesome camera in every respect . 	Camcorder
It 's slim , compact , looks great , great zooming , and it delivers more than you can expect from a regular camcorder . It is definitely in the `` professional '' range of camcorders . I have used the DCR-PC330 in different occasions varying from soccer and basketball games to family reunions and birthdays . This camcorder has always delivered above my expectations . Yes , the software that comes with it is not great , but windows movie maker would work just fine if you 're not looking for extra professional quality and you have a few hours to spend . However , the battery life is short , the stills are to be trashed , and the memory stick that comes with the camera is a joke . I would recommend you buy a cheap camera if you want stills . I bought one for 80 bucks which delivers better quality pictures than the DCR-PC330 	Camcorder
Great camera if video is n't intended to be shared on video sharing websites such as Vimeo or YouTube because the picture quality is n't the best even though I still use it for this purpose . And of course it wo n't be the best since it 's a standard definition camera . But the microphone and zoom is excellent . I like this camera , but it 's just average . 	Camcorder
i got to say this cam is pretty suckish for being '' 1080p HD '' the video quality is horrible indoors its very grainy and just blahhh . . maybe its just me or is the audio and video off ? like the video is slower than the audio so the video looks all crazy when i upload it ! it looks a litte better recording outdoors but its still crappy . . i think my cellphone takes better videos , the picture quailty is ok . . i do n't think people should waste their money or time on this , its something you give a 7 year old to play with . . you 'll be better of with a compact camera that has hd video or a FlipHD . i was way more happy with the FlipHD i purchased . THIS THING IS AN EMBARRASSMENT . 	Camcorder
After researching the digital camcorder field for three years , I decided this camera looked like the best in the less-than - $ 400 market . The camcorder performed magnificently for me for the three weeks I had it and it has an extraordinary feature set for the money . However , the motor emits an extremely annoying noise which is captured on the tape and sounds like you were recording everything in a machine shop . On going back to the Internet and researching other reviews , I found that this is a very common problem with this camera . So sad ! I loved this camera , but the recorded motor whine killed what was otherwise a 5-star camcorder . 	Camcorder
This camera works great during the day but night shots are n't that great . There is a little motor noise but hardly noticeable . This camera has great features but some are hard to get to or use them when you need it . 	Camcorder
This product works fine for me , with no problem with the door opening and closing . It is easy to see what you have taken right away . The sound recording is very good , picks up traffic noise , your own speach , or whatever ... Really great for concerts ... <p> Even in very low light conditions , you can record what you see , and even zoom in on the moon , or a postage stamp ! <p> Will automatically focus in at only 3 or 4 inches away from an object ! <p> It took me some time to figure out how to get it to show the date and time , however , it does work once it is set correctly and programed . <p> The 200x zoom is great , but of course the picture is not as clear and sharp the closer you zoom in on your subject ... but you will soon see that 1x to about 75x is all you really need ... <p> All in all , this is a great camcorder , and very easy to use !

This charger was purchased because it is compact and does not have a separate power cord like the factory provided one with my camera . It is inexpensive , works well and arrived in 4 days . 	Camcorder
I bought this about 3 weeks ago and will not use anything else . The ease of this Camcorder is great . The Menus are good and the Book that came with it is pretty good . I did have to call Tech Support on some Thing that I was not sure on but she was very helpful and did not make me feel small for calling on this . I will keep that a secret for the reason that I called . Keep up the Good Work Sharp . <p> Thanks Scott 	Camcorder
After conducting a couple weeks of research for a camera to shoot family events -LRB- Holidays , birthday parties , etc. -RRB- , I decided to purchase this camcorder for 2 main reasons . The size and the picture quality . If you are looking for a nice small camera this is perfect . Sure the other minidv cameras are small but when I compared the dimensions this one was a bit smaller then the other Canon camcorders I was looking at . And since size really does matter , this was a `` huge '' factor . Picture quality in normal light conditions is good , but in lower light the picture is a bit grainy and the LED lights do n't do anything to help . The negatives ? In quieter conditions , there is most certainly a hissing noise in playback from the tape motor . Enough to make me return the camera ? No , but if I was using this for any other reason then to shoot family events I would more than likely try a different camera . Another negative is the cheap handstrap , and the plastic covers that cover the different inputs . I 'm guessing after just a little use those little cheap plastic covers are just going to fall off . All-in-all I 'd recommend this camera for people looking to shoot family events . If the hissing noise did n't exist this camera would be 5 stars -LRB- for a budget priced camera -RRB- . 	Camcorder
Had this camcorder for 21\/2 years . Used it maybe for about only 20-30 hours worth of tapes . The features were nice , video was nice , easy to use BUT !!!! The tape ejection door is right where your hand holds the camera . The door where you insert and remove the tape started opening by itself , for no reason ? Then , it would jam and get stuck . Now , I ca n't get the darn thing opened to remove my latest tape . seems like other people had the same problem . I am surprised that they have to make such a fancy mechanical door , just something more to go wrong ... . and it did . $ 400 + \/ - down the drain . Thanks for NOTHING Sony !!!!!!!! 	Camcorder
After purchasing my digital video camera in late November of last year and creating exactly 2 video tapes , the camera stopped working and began generating an E01 error message . After digging out my paperwork , I was dismayed to learn that the warranty covers a year in parts but only 90 days labor . I brought the unit to JVC 's recommended service center and was quoted a huge repair bill to re-align and overhaul the camera . After buying the camera less than a year ago I just do n't know if I can bring myself to spend the additional money to ` make it actually work ' . If you have to buy this camera make sure you get the extended warranty . 	Camcorder
Pros : Easy to operate ; generally good video quality ; strong home-video feature set . <p> Cons : Constant low-level noise ; middling low-light performance ; no control over auto power-off . <p> Summary : As noted many times before , the indoor lighting is not very good . . but I expected this much from reading other reviews . But what has really bummed me out is that 3 months after purchasing the camera -LRB- with little use in that time -RRB- the camera eject refused to open . So now my cassette is stuck inside the camera . We have provided the maximum power to the camera by using the power from the wall outlet and still no tape eject . My wife contacted Canon support . They told her there are only 2 places in the country that fix Video Cameras . . -LRB- yeah , ok -RRB- . . and that we would have to ship back to them . According to their tech support , it sounds like an alignment problem . Sounds like I 'm taking my car to the mechanic . They said they would have to get it back to the factory to re-align it . Give me a break . If you do not plan on using this camera for alot of indoor footage . . and if you are lucky enough to avoid getting a CANON LEMON , such as mine . . you may be okay . But my Canon experience has been horrible . regardless of whether or not the problem is covered under warranty -LRB- which it better be -RRB- I 'm disappointed with my decision to choose this product .

You just insert this item into your camera and run it for 10 seconds . It is very clear : only do it for 10 seconds , maybe do it twice , but stop there . I guess it 's abrasive and prolonged use could ruin the heads . Well , I did n't have my glasses on , and ran the thing for 10 seconds , then removed it and inserted the normal tape . But I got distracted or something , and stuck the cleaner back in the camera and played it for a couple of minutes before I figured out what was going on . The camera seems to be working OK for now but I really thought I had ruined it . This product 's case should be the same bright orange that 's on a cop 's traffic vest , with `` HEAD CLEANER '' written in big letters all over it . Apart from that , the product did fix my camera and I was pleased with it . 	Camcorder
I did n't expect much , since the research I did on the product said it 's not really worth the time or money . The price was cheap enough for me to give it a shot and it did n't seem like I had many other options . The item arrived quickly , but unfortunately there was no response when used between my camcorder and pc . Since , it did n't cost me much I just chalked it up as a loss and moved on . Maybe it will work for others . 	Camcorder
Picture quality is good , loud & sensitive mono sound , easy and not too heavy -LRB- about 2 lbs with battery -RRB- , not too big size for traveling -LRB- about 4.5 x 5 x 11 inches -RRB- . STANDARD BATTERY that came with this camera works 2 hours for B&W viewfinder recording 50 minutes with color LCD recording . If you play black a lot on the LCD -LRB- I like to do that -RRB- , this battery will last about 30 minutes , charging time is about 1 hour . Option batteries are available , and I think I should have one . <p> Night shot and super night shot movies is just like in a horror movies , every things look faded-green or B&W and people has silver eyes , well , at least I can see the objects -LRB- I shot in total darkness -RRB- . The battery consuming is higher with the night shorts . By the way that tiny built-in light is useless . Remote seems to be useful for the play back only , hardly used at all . I love the multivotage adapter that came with the camera , I wish Sony adds the PAL playback too incase of traveling to Europe and Asia -LRB- Hitachi has this feature -RRB- . <p> Photo effects are not very useful but programe AE are good and easy , however the icons of programe AE are very tiny , quite difficult to figure out what programes am I on -LRB- my eyes are getting old -RRB- . Every one looks good on that small color LCD , however in the strong day light it is very difficult to see that screen , the manual recommend to use the B&W viewfinder instead . Multilanguage titles with custom setting options . <p> If you live a hi-tech life , do not buy this cam . because the output is only A\/V -LRB- 2 jacks -RRB- , no s-video connection , so it 's not working with my TV-video capture card in the computer -LRB- I use Avermedia product -RRB- , I heard that it might work on pinnacle system , but did not try it yet . I think I might be able to connect it through the VCR which has A\/V connector and can be connected to my TV card , however this attempt has n't been succesful . <p> The accesories price are quite expensive -LRB- i.e. separate battery chargers , spare batteries , filters , car battery adapter -RRB- espectially if you buy them direct from sony ...

We got this camera Christmas of 2010 . I wanted a camera to be able to shoot home family movies and stuff like that . We didnt end up using it as much as I would have liked , but I did really like it when it worked . Very easy to use , very compact and easy to take places . Only complaint about the camera at first was it didnt shoot very good video at night time . It was pretty grainy and hard to make things out . We pulled the camera out this Easter 2012 and the screen was blank . I could hear the camera working , lights , power , etc. ... but had no screen . I did all the things I could think to do on my own like to take out battery , hit reset , etc. . Still had no luck so I contacted Sony . They had me go through the same troubleshooting steps and said it would need to be repaired . If it was under warranty it would have been 45.00 flat rate he said , but since I was a few months over the 1 year it would run 211.00 ! Ha ha that is the cost of a whole new camera ! I understand that the customer service agent was doing his best to help me and it is just their policy , but that is ridiculous . This camera was used maybe 15 times in the short time we have owned it , and when not in use it was kept in a nice case up on the shelf to avoid my son messing with it . I would like to get it fixed , but I can actually get the newer model DCR-SX45 for 198.00 here on Amazon . After doing some research I have found that it is a pretty common problem and may be the ribbon cables due to the way the screen folds out . Im bummed but I think at this point I am going to start looking for a different brand to purchase . 	Camcorder
I wanted a wide angle that would fit without an adapter ring onto my Sony 403 videocam . Unfortunatly , the ad implied that it would , but instead they sent an adapter ring , which works OK , but sometimes locks onto the camera lens threads , and the wide angle comes off , leaving the adapter ring very hard-threaded onto the camera . Had to use pliers -LRB- carefully -RRB- to remove it . The .5 wide angle is essential to good pictures with the videocam . It makes taking pics in rooms , for instance , sooo much easier and reduces the `` panning '' that you 'd otherwise have to do . 	Camcorder
I 'm very pleased with the 510 . I bought the 12 hour mother-of-all-batteries and took the camera to Papua New Guinea where I took the equivalent of about 3000 still photographs on 3 digital hi-8 cassettes . I also took a lot of straight video footage from which I was able to extract static images of rather good quality , depending on the amount of motion artifact . My one complaint is that in low light the image tends to get a bit grainy ... I have n't figured out how to solve this problem . Let me know if you do . 	Camcorder
It is the best camera we have had so far . It is our 3rd . and by far the best for the money . 	Camcorder
This is an excellent quality mini DV tape head cleaner . I bought this to clean my Sony mini DV camcorder and it worked perfectly .

The Cannon Vixia HF 300 is my first camcorder , so I am not an expert on camcorder operation , although I am a amateur photographer with a pro level camera . The camcorder was purchased to record family events with a absolute minimum of fuss and pre-adjustment of the camcorder , but with high quality high definition video . T he camcorder does this with ease , and no bother The image stabilization works very well , which was a must for me because I have a nerve disorder that effects my stability . The built in sound recorder does it 's job , but much better sound quality could be had with an external mike The only down side for me is the included software . If you are going to do any editing I would recommend getting a video editing program . Over all the camcorder does what I want it to do , and does it well . 	Camcorder
This is not a bad camera but I am having trouble with it not wanting to record or playback tapes . I have tried different tapes thinking maybe it was the tape but no matter what I do , it wo n't work . Took it to the place I got it , they had to send it away , which took forever , and all they done was use a headcleaner on it . They said they could not find out any problem with it . I brought it home and it started doing the same thing again and I bought a Maxell head cleaner and used it several times on it and it worked okay for awhile . Now it is back to doing the same thing again on not recording or playing back a tape . Do not know what the problem is . It just could be that I got a `` lemon . '' I have contacted Sony but have never heard anything back . 	Camcorder
I visited several sites , and looked at a lot of product reviews . But after reading some of the reviews here , I decided to take the plunge ! I purchased mine for ... less than the stated price here , even though I 'm not pleased with the customer service I received from the store I bought it at , I VERY please so far with MY NEW Sony DCR-TRV130 ! I also brought the infrared unit and ca n't wait to try it out ! I going to get the upgrade for my PC , and I will be set . OOPs almost forgot , both the DV Camcorder kit , and the ULEAD will require updates you can find on their websites to work with XP and they 're signed . <p> Thanks again to all those who took the time to write a review . You , and Amazon.com were VERY helpful in my deciding to make this purchase . <p> Ok . . upgrades in place , and BOY was it a chore ! But I 'm STILL VERY PLEASED with this camcorder . I got a 1394 Firewire -LRB- Home DV Editing Kit -RRB- made by SIIG , Inc. , which is supported by XP . and increased memory to 512MB . Why was it a chore ? Because I let COMPUSA do the upgrade . I must say they did offer to assist me in getting my camcorder to work with the new upgrades with also included a NVIDA Geofore 2MX 100\/200 , but BELIEVE me ... save yourself the hassle , and do it yourself ! In the end I did just that ! All I had to do once I got everything set up was make sure my camcorder was turned to VCR BEFORE connecting it to my pc , and before opening any editing programs . I have ULEAD VideoStudio , and MS MovieMaker , and Windows Media Player , all work well together . I was able to make stills , and a CD with ease ! This camcorder is GREAT no matter what anyone says ! I still give it a four because it was a hassle to get to work with my PC . I almost gave up , but glad I did n't . You will need to get patches for the 1394 kit , and ULEAD from their websites to work with XP . Both are digitally signed . Also do n't put an antivius program to the 1394 ports . 	Camcorder
I wanted one camera to take both stills and video . The video is fine . The still shots are absolutely terrible . To take an indoor Christmas picture of my kids for our Christmas cards I had to set up desk lamps pointed at them to get enough light . And even then it was grainy . Disappointing because the camera size is nice , not big to lug around . The poor picture quality is not worth it . 	Camcorder
this is my first5 digital camcorder so i was kinda hoping for something more powerfull and it takes excellent shots though 	Camcorder
Wow . What a buy for the price . This camera has most all the options of a way more expensive camera , but it for only -LRB- this price -RRB- . People complain about it not having an LCD , I do not like those , they result in shaky photography -LRB- not with this puppy though and its Image Stabilization , which is great . -RRB- and it drains the battery . So I did n't care about that . If you really want an LCD , you can move up to the next level , which is 50 dollars more . But in the process you lose the Image Stabilization , so really this camera is the better buy . It come with great features . First off , the battery lasts for a long time , you can get 90 minutes of footage which it , even with auto-focus and zooming in and out . Its great . And its easy to recharge , in fact the camera tells you how many minutes left until a full charge . Also , it tells you the minutes of camera battery you have left , instead of one of those battery meters , which can be misleading . It comes with cool features , one where it outlines the subjects in the picture , and makes it turn into a cartoon . You can make black and white movies , and even record in 16:9 mode . It comes with a titler , so you can label you movies . You can chooose the location , size , and color of the title , and it has capibility to write in 22 lanuages ... which was handy on my trip to Mexico . The NightShot OLux was too cool , even when it is pitch black , the thing can record and see everything . It has 20x optical zoom , and 460x digital . I do n't like digital , it just enlarges the pixels to zoom , so the 20x optical is all you need . It inlcudes 5 types of faders , which are all neat . The camera can record any play my old 8mm tapes . For the price , this is a wonder . If you are looking for any eaasy camera to use , chucked with all the options , get the Sony CCD-TR818 . Make sure before you use it to turn of `` auto-date '' which automatically puts the date on the first 10 seconds of a shot . It can be easily turned off in the user-friendly menu system . 	Camcorder
great overall camcorder . you have to love the 25x zoom . easy to use . i 've gone through just about all the features with only two trips to the manual . the grandparents loved being able to get print out pictures of their new grandson instantly during our last visit . 	Camcorder
Please be aware that hidden within the knowledge-base of Canon 's website is the fact that this model -LRB- HF M300 -RRB- does NOT convert HD -LRB- high def -RRB- files down to SD -LRB- standard def -RRB- as the description above would indicate . I ordered with the belief that the only difference was the absence of internal memory , but I was mistaken . When doing some simple edits with iMovie or Final Cut , HD files are enormous , so I liked the idea of having the camera down-convert for projects I want in standard definition . Other aspects of this unit have been fine so far , though I recommend getting an external mic -LRB- like Rode -RRB- for better sound . This M300 , however , will be going back in exchange for a model that DOES have the above stated features . This felt awfully tricky to me . 	Camcorder
This little box aint so bad , It plays my recorded Tapes to my computer for editing , since my PRO grade CANON XL1S That refuses to without eating tapes , BUYER BEWARE ! The used stuff can cost you more in the short term than you think , My CANON XL1S will cost me 350.00 to 500.00 plus shipping to get professionally repaired , this little Canon OPTURA 200MC save me from losing what might be the lastOf my KIDS Sports games . So If you have ISSUES with your CANON XL1S or got burned like I did , this will play then into your computer throughout the 1394 DV in\/output cord although not the same resolution it will save your MEMORIES FROM BEING TOTALLY LOST !

I agree with everything people have written about the excellent video quality of this camera . But I 've found two things I do n't like : 1 -RRB- There is no neck strap , nor any way to attach one . I am getting one of those tethers that fastens to the tripod adapter screw , but that 's not a very elegant solution , and the camera will dangle upside down . I 'm a guy who goes on vacation with a video camera and a DSLR . So I need a way to let go of the video camera while shooting stills . This is a sad oversight by Sony . They could have at least put a post somewhere and sold the strap as an optional accessory . 2 -RRB- The image stabilization is fabulous when you are shooting at wide angle . While walking alongside my wife , the picture looked like it was shot with a Steadycam . But without a tripod , when lens is at telephoto the image trembles as though there was no image stabilization at all . And since this lens is a fairly wide one , there will be lots of stuff where you 'll want a closer shot . If you 're handheld , you 'll need to steady yourself as best you can , since the camera 's software does n't help a lot . Other than that , the camera is definitely worth five stars . Strangely enough , Sony announced an upgraded version , the XR560 at NAB , and promised it for April 2011 delivery . It will have 64GB of solid state storage , versus 240GB on a hard drive in this camera . For my purposes -LRB- going on two-week vacations , etc. -RRB- the current camera is what I need because of its extended storage capacity , even if there is the remote chance of a hard drive failure , compared to solid state . But we are now halfway into May , and no one seems to be advertising the new model yet , not even to say that it is coming . In any case , I ca n't see how Sony could improve the video quality of the XR550V ; only my two little quibbles . 	Camcorder
I just want to say the camera and software has a lot of problems , get a Sony instead . I bought this @ $ 349 , the price zoomed to $ 649 , now it 's out of stock . 	Camcorder
This is the cheapest high-def camera from sony , has exactly the same quality and specs than the other more expensive HD handycams but it doesnt come with any memory at all -LRB- that 's the catch ! -RRB- . I also purchased the sony pro duo 16GB mark2 memory , that provides enough space to save up to 90min on full hd -LRB- 1920x1080 -RRB- quality for less than $ 70 ! When I first opened the box I couldnt believe how small this camera is and I thought it would be a problem since I have big hands , but I was mistaken , I have full access to all the buttons -LRB- rec - zoom - mode -RRB- with only one hand . Once connected to an HDTV the recording\/play back quality is amazing . Steady-shot technology makes it really easy to take great and stable shots even when zooming in and no tripod . Highly recommended ! Pros : excellent video recording quality even on low-light shots , stereo microphone array , 25x optical zoom , touch screen has good response -LRB- even for big fingers like mine ! -RRB- , user-friendly menus to configure settings , Carl Zeiss - Vario Tessar lens , stock battery -LRB- NP-FV50 -RRB- has good charge above 100mins , steady-shot works great -LRB- image stabilizer -RRB- . Cons : no memory , no case , no view-finder , no batt-only AC charger -LRB- will have to charge the battery while mounted on the camera -RRB- , lcd has to be open or the camera will turn off -LRB- but you can turn the lcd 180deg , close it and that works ! -RRB- , no mini-HDMI to full-HDMI adapter cable . Important\/recommended accesories : - Sony PRO Duo 8\/16\/32 GB Mark2 memory stick - HDMI Cable , mini-to-full -LRB- Part No. . VMC-15MHD -RRB- - Travel AC charger -LRB- Part No. . BC-TRV -RRB- - Carrying case with extra-battery -LRB- Part No. . ACC-FV50A -RRB- - Shooting grip with mini-tripod -LRB- Part No. . GP-AVTI -RRB- Hope this review will be helpful ! 	Camcorder
It takes 2 days for it to charge and use for ONE DAY ONLY ! Please ! get one that is better . It might cost more , but trust me , it would be worth every penny !! 	Camcorder
This is a great camcorder . I love the LCD display so I know exactly what I 'm shooting and the range I 'm getting . It makes recording fun and easy . No more straining one eye because with the LCD display , I can just look at the screen . It also comes with some great features such a powerful 72X zoom and special effects that add little neat touches to every recording experience . The fade function is nice since if offers the ability to make your recordings look more professional like the movies . It 's definitely a product that one should have . I highly recommend it . And so what if it 's not a digital camcorder . Most people probabaly do n't even want to deal with all that software installation and hook up to the computer anyway . I think most of us have VCR 's and popping in a tape to watch is much faster and easier than having to boot up the computer and do all that hooking up the wires and things of that nature . So if you 're in for entertainment that does n't entangle you in computer wires , then this camcorder is for you . Buy one and you 'll see what I mean . 	Camcorder
Older model came out just prior to 1394 standard . Lots of features , many of dubious value . RCA-style jacks are the only way to get video -LRB- analog only -RRB- to your computer for editing , limiting its usefulness as a digital camera . Included accessories are just gizmos that do n't help the editing process . If you need digital AND want to edit with your computer , buy a camera that has 1394 capability . Otherwise , spend your money on Hi8 with more available features . 	Camcorder

"</div> <spanclass=""tiny""> Length : : 5:59 Mins </span> COLOR : The camcorder does a good job in the color department , most of the time you get Accurate & Natural colors but other times it tends to vivid the blues & reds . The same happens with the Canon HF-S21 , while Panasonic HDC-TM350 & HDC-TM700 looks more natural `` most of the time '' . LCD : The touch responsiveness is simply amazing , comparing it to the Very Difficult to handle of the Canon HF-S21 and the just OK of the Panasonic family . The resolution is the best of his class by far . Also you can organize it in a very custom way ; `` You can use the menu items easily by registering the menu items you use most often on MY MENU . You can register 6 menus items on each MY MENUS of the MOVIE , PHOTOS and PAYBACK . That 's a total of 18 pre-determent Custom Menus . LENS : The HDR-CX550V has larger lens than last year 's model . The new G-Lens is capable of capturing videos at enormously wide angles , Close to 20 degrees more than Canons & JVC are capable of . It 's also a much wider angle than you 'll get from the Panasonic HDC-TM700 . Low Light : In this area the clear winner is the HDC-TM350 or HDC-TM700 , Sony has the Night Shot which allows to record in almost 0 LUX but you get a graining and unacceptable quality . Using the LOW LUX feature improves the image quality but some light is needed to be able to record . RECORDING MODES : Format - Resolution - Bitrate - Codec HD FX - 1920 x 1080 - 24Mbps - H. 264AVC -LRB- AVCHD -RRB- HD FH - 1920 x 1080 - 17Mbps - H. 264AVC -LRB- AVCHD -RRB- HD HQ - 1920 x 1080 - 9Mbps - H. 264AVC -LRB- AVCHD -RRB- HD LP - 1920 x 1080 - 5Mbps - H. 264AVC -LRB- AVCHD -RRB- STD - 720 x 480 - 9Mbps - MPEG-2 ZOOM & STEADYSHOT : For some reason the SteadyShot has an impact on the zoom of the camera , when you have the SteadyShot set to Active the zoom goes up to 14X -LRB- this has been a complain for some reviewers because they have said it only goes up to 10X -RRB- but if you have the SteadyShot in Standard or OFF it does only go to 10X . Based on this , it seems like a good idea to consider that setting depending on the scene and recording conditions , example ; if you are going to use the camcorder on a tripod to film landscapes , sunsets or any other scenography in which you want a wider angle it will be very helpful to turn OFF or put in Active the SteadyShot , but if the situation is the other way around , you want to record a far away object and want them to looks closer then the SteadyShot should be in Active mode even when using a tripod . Comparing the HDC-TM700 -LRB- 12X -RRB- to the HDR-CX550 -LRB- 10X -RRB- in Optical Zoom and TM700 -LRB- 18X I. Zoom -RRB- vs. CX550 -LRB- 14X Without been named or pointed out by anybody else -RRB- . At Digital Zoom the TM700 goes up to 30X or 700X -LRB- complementing its name -RRB- while CX550 MAX is 120X , either of them display very bad and distorted images when the Digital Zoom is used . The Stabilization produced by the STEADYSHOT is one of the best I have ever seen , it works great in all situations while keeping very sharp image quality . STILL PICTURE : In the still picture nobody can beat the JVC GZ-HM1 as far as quality-sharpness-colors ; the Sony does a descent job just like any other camcorder in this price range . The Smile Shutter is one of the FUN features of this Camcorder , this allows to take a picture every time the cam detects someone smiling , Smile shutter can be set so that it is always on , to work during video recording only , or it can be turned off completely but unfortunately this is NOT available when recording at the MAX Quality Setting of 24Mbps HD FX Mode . FUN Features : Smooth Slow Record : A slow motion setting that records 3 seconds of footage and turns it into 12 seconds of Very Slow Video . This setting shoots at a very high Frame Rate of 240fps in order to create the slow motion effect . You have the option to select that the Camcorder record those 3 seconds after you press the START button or be recording at all time -LRB- like a Pre-Record Mode -RRB- so when you press the START button the last 3 seconds will be converted into the 12 seconds of Very Slow Video . The quality of this Smooth Slow Record is NOT quite close to HD , it may be SD quality at 16x9 aspect ratio . Golf Shot : Takes two quick seconds of video and divides it into frames that are recorded as a movie and photos in a 16x9 aspect ratio . GPS : The built-in GPS allows you to keep track of your videos & photos by the location in which they were shot . By having the GPS on , the battery life decreases by 2-3 % . CONCLUSIONS : This is a good camcorder with lots of Manuals and Fun features , very portable , with a good overall performance ; it looks like a very good choice for a Family-Vacation 's Camcorder . -LRB- ... -RRB- "	Camcorder
After long and painstaking research , I settled on this camera . But try to find any comparisons , and you turn up very little . So here 's my few words of thought . <p> The JVC GRD-VP3u is the next best contender in this price range . It wins for size and still images , but not much else . <p> The Canons did not have the resolution in the viewfinder or LCD panel quite like the Sony -LRB- best -RRB- or JVC . They also had a cheaper feel when hefted . The feature set was not bad , but overall I could n't get the comfort level with them as with the other two . <p> The Panasonics also came across lacking . Great feature sets , but the size , build , picture quality , viewfinder and LCD resolution , and style did n't work for me . The prices were good , but little else . <p> I quit comparing much else . It really came down to the PC9 and the DVP3u . Now , the JVC boasts a few features that would have taken the cake , but they did n't seem to work very well . NightAlive did n't seem to make a significant difference , if barely noticeable . It certainly did n't work well enough in low light to overcome the advantage of Sony 's NightShot , even with the lacking color in NightShot mode . <p> Sony further beefed up NightShot with a Super mode that produces a choppy picture . However , it provided an exceptionally good image in total darkness -- whatever that may be worth to those who can get over the choppy picture . <p> The Sony touchscreen is a real winner in my book . It made the system very intuitive and easy to use . One criticism is that in the menu mode some of the abbreviations were a little too cryptic at first . However , this touchscreen system gets high marks for being well designed , functional even during recording , and easy to use . <p> Both the Sony and JVC are light and small . This has made use a desire and more common than my older camcorder . I consider both brands good quality builds , but Sony seems to be the better brand for overall equipment features , quality and performance . <p> I prefer JVC 's lens cap -LRB- a sliding panel -RRB- to the cap that covers the Sony lens . It is a minor nuisance to have a cap dangling around while using the camera . <p> The video quality of the Sony is fabulous . It produces wonderful video , even better in dark than I expected . As everyone says , bright light produces the \* best \* video , but do n't let that suggest that the video is bad in lower light . <p> The Sony connects easily to the computer and actually transfers pics and video clips from the memory card very quickly via USB . While USB is a relatively fast bus , many devices can not provide the throughput , in and of themselves . However , the Sony does well . <p> I have not tried a Firewire transfer yet , but I expect this to be handled just as well by Sony and JVC alike . <p> In summary , I believe that the few features on the JVC that are seemingly better than on the Sony do not perform well enough on their own , nor overcome in total the features of the Sony camera . <p> Good-luck .

I have been searching for a replacement for my Sony DCR-TRV310 Digital 8 which is a great camcorder but difficult to carry around when traveling . I do a lot of video editing on my older Sony Vaio RS530G PC , running on XP SP3 so I ruled out the new high definition cameras . I bought this camcorder in a store so I could return it easily if I did like its performance or format . In short , I missed the viewfinder ; the LCD screen was impossible to see in sunlight and actually reflected a glare . The touch screen menu although easy enough to figure out was also difficult to see outdoors in sunlight and kind of cumbersome to go through the menu . It is akin to press one if you want English , etc. . The video quality was poor with a bluish , grainy quality . Low light indoor video was very dark and amber . Actually my Sony Cyber-Shot takes better videos . It does not offer much in the way of faders\/transitional effects or manual controls . I downloaded and printed the entire manual because the one supplied in the box was a pamphlet and offered no real technical advice beyond charging and powering up , shooting and burning to DVD . My ability to edit the video format was the biggest disappointment because my editing format of choice to trim video clips is Click to DVD and that is not compatible . I have small hands and still found the arrangement of touch and manual controls to be awkward . The still pictures I took outdoors were better than I expected . I wish I could put my old Sony on a diet . After trying this out for a few days it went back to the store and I believe I will stick to tape and buy the Cannon HV40 . 	Camcorder
This camcorder was introduced in 1999 , which was in essence the `` high water '' mark year of the Sony analog camcorder line . Digital -- which had been introduced by Sony years earlier -- took over the `` top of the line '' position the following year , which led Sony to simultaneously begin `` cheapening '' the Hi8 analog machines -LRB- in an attempt to drive the `` bells and whistles crowd '' to the more profitable digital camcorders -RRB- . This meant stereo sound disappeared from the Hi8s in 2000 , as did flying erase heads , digital special effects and photo mode . <p> Being the Hi8 line leader the previous year -- before that cheapening began -- the TRV87 is therefore Sony consumer analog video at its best , crammed with every feature Sony ever put into that format . It 's all here -- the Hi8XR format -LRB- 440 lines of vertical resolution , which in side to side comparison with DV 's 500 lines is almost impossible to differentiate -RRB- , LCD viewing , digital special effects , on-board lighting , Super Nightshot , photo mode , full titling , a wide range of pre-programmed exposure modes , Laserlink ... it goes on and on . Yes , granted , the chassis is that classic `` handful '' TRV size , so this Sony is n't quite as cute and sexy as those teeny current DV palmcorders - but it provides video that is just as good , and costs a lot , lot less . This machine is destined to be a classic , in the same category as the infamous Sony TR101 -LRB- their first serious Hi8 machine from almost a decade earlier -RRB- . 	Camcorder
The JVC GR-DVF10 lets you take still photographs in a number of formats , from simple snapshots to borders and even multiple thumbnails . If you want to download and edit your digital still images and video on a computer , however , you have to purchase a separate video capture card first . 	Camcorder
When I purchased this item , I was under the impression it was a Sony Digital Camera Battery Charger , as advertised . It is definitely not ! I am not , however displeased with the product , as it is working very well , and charges my batteries quickly . If it were not working so well , I 'd give it a much lower rating for false advertising , which really bothers me . I like the red light that turns green when the battery has finished charging . Good product for the price , but not a Sony . 	Camcorder
Very small and compact , but well laid out so for as the user is concerned . Has both a color viewfinder and a 2.5 '' LED that extends out from the left side . To save battery power , you can only use one at a time however . Some of the settings are a bit confusing , but going through the manual -LRB- well written by the way -RRB- will quickly supply answers to any questions you may have . <p> Low light capability is not as good as some others , but the camcorder works well in light ample to read by . By comparison with my Nikon FM -LRB- 50mm F1 .8 -RRB- , the Canon ZR-20 will do a good job down to what would be about 1\/60 of a second on ISO 100 . It will do a fairly decent job a couple of stops lower , but gets `` grainy '' at low light levels . Daylight however is excellent . I also found the still feature works well in daylight , but gets rather `` grainy '' in low light -LRB- like an old `` GIF '' at about 320x240 -RRB- . I 'd guess in good light that stills work out to be about VGA level -LRB- 640x480 -RRB- , which serves . <p> This is not a digital camera , and if your major interest is in that direction , you 'd be better off buying a regular digital camera . On the other hand the stills I 've taken in daylight looked pretty good on a TV , and the recordings create images that are the equal of anything you can get off the air or from your local cable provider . This is using the video in and audio in jacks on a regular TV , as none of mine have the S-video feature . Which no doubt would be even better yet . <p> Tape loading seems a bit slow , but I guess this is the way it is . Works OK , but my old VHS camcorder is a lot easier to load . <p> Digital is definitely the way to go , and Canon optics seem to be pretty good . Lens is a F1.8-2 .9 zoom with a range of 4mm to 40mm . I 'd guess this works out to about 40mm to 400mm on a 35 . The digital zoom can be set at two settings , one giving 40x and the other 200x . The 40x setting is very marginal , and the 200x is nothing but a waste of time . On the other hand the optical zoom is good , and you can shut off the digital zoom if you wish . <p> If you 're looking for a good small camcorder , this might be the one for you . It is small , but seems to be fairly well thought out except that the mike probably should have been mounted somewhere further away from the tape transport area ... 	Camcorder
The best thing about the Sharp ViewCam camcorders -- all of them -- is that they allow you to record family events while still taking part in them . With the camera discreetly held at waist level rather than in front of your face , you can still be a part of the conversation . People find it less intimidating , too , so they tend to behave more naturally . You can also flip the LCD 180 degrees , and record yourself . <p> The only downside is that the LCD sucks up batteries , so buy a spare set . 	Camcorder
My camera had artifacts during playback so I ordered this tape since I have a Panasonic camera . After running the tape for the instructed 10 seconds the playback of my home movies was fixed . I would recommend this to anyone that has a Panasonic Mini DV camera . 	Camcorder
I own pro digital cameras , but I get an awful lot of use from this little Cannon . Scouting locations , special events , vacations , you name it I 've used it . The picture quality is superb , though do n't expect the same results as a $ 10,000 pro cam . It does not work well in low light situations , using the low light setting the camera must be held perfectly still , as in tripod , even then the results are not very good . But that 's what camera lights are for . That short comming aside , buy this camera and you will want to take it with you every where you go . It will far exceed your expectations . It 's easy to handle , fits snug in the palm of your hand . Well worth the price . 	Camcorder
This camera is very cheap -LRB- less than 400 bucks , I bought one here in L.A. and it was made in China -RRB- but the quality and performace is very good ! I recommend this product to those person looking for a cheap camcorder but the quality\/performace is very good . 	Camcorder
The camera works great . The only time I saw the blue dot is when I was shooting into the sun . Not a problem for me . I wish there was a slighly larger viewfnder for outdoor shooting . The LCD touch screen has great detail and the menus are easy to use . I was confused by the + delete symbol in lower right hand screen . I was deleting the good videos instead of the ones I wantd to delete . Finaly I had to navigate through a couple of menus to delete video segments . The camere did lock up -LRB- get confused -RRB- when I was switching between viewfinder and LCD screen . I had to power down and decide to use the LCD screen or the viewfinder . 64 Gig of memory is nice . I may not ever purchase a memory stick . The best part of the camera is the wide angle and low light performance . I looked long and hard at the Canon HF S20 and Panasonic HDC-TM700K cameas . I needed wide angle and I was not sure I wanted to do 1080P 60 . 	Camcorder
I bought this for both of my daughters for Christmas . I had read some reviews and thought I would give it a try for the minimal price . They spent the better part of the day recording tons of video clips of the lovely snow and barely used any of the battery strength . It was easy for them to figure out on their own and for the price I was n't afraid to let them go out and do whatever with it . My girls are 15 and 11 and they just love their camcorders . It is not the quality of a high dollar camera , but it definately does the job and has made them happy . I did put 256 sd cards in each of them and recommend buying the extra memory . Good luck !!!

I have owned the zr10 for 3 years . Initially , I was thrilled to death over it 's small form factor , quality of picture -LRB- in good light -RRB- and fantastic cd quality sound . <p> Now , it just eats tapes , so I can no longer enjoy it 's small form factor , quality of picture -LRB- in good light -RRB- and fantastic cd quality sound . <p> Nope , it just eats tapes . It seems to enjoy eating maxell as well as TDK , but will eat just about anything you serve it . I have placed my camcorder on a diet of blank tapes . It is not to be trusted with the task of preserving the memories of my children . It is now , basically , a $ 600 mistake . <p> My advice to you ? Buy from a company that will stand by it 's product line . 	Camcorder
I have setup the recording mode on the second best -LRB- FH -RRB- which is the only setting to create DVD for avchd format . I was so impressed with the video quality when I played on my bluray player . Not that I 'm not familiar with HD , I have own 1080p and HD 's more than 3 years now . Can not even compare with my previous 1080p by Kodak . My only complain is the size so tiny that even now I have no idea how to hold it on my palm . My recommendation is , you may need a protective lens and an additional battery for backup . 	Camcorder
A great camera compared with others of the same size and price range . Its processor is so smart to quickly detect and adjust to scene , light level , and focus . Great surround sound recording . Unbelievably great resolution and clarity even in low light conditions . The Sony software PMB that comes with it is also very useful and easy to use . 	Camcorder
I 've been using this camera for almost a year . Ease of use is excellent . Quality of video much better than the Canon ZR series . I do n't use it for still images , have a Sony DSC-F707 , so I ca n't comment . Low light video performance is better than I expected . This model has yet to eat a tape or moisture check in 10 months . I 've used it skiing down the Rockies and treking through jungles . Of course , being a male , I 'm now looking at moving up to the Optura 300 . 	Camcorder

I Received the HFR100 as an early birthday gift and at first it seemed alright . But then i really started testing it , and came up with an overall conclusion to the camera . It 's not all it 's cracked out to be , and could be better for the price . Reasons : The 60i Frame rate is pointless . If you 're going to shoot shoot with this camera shoot in 24p or 30p . At highest quality it 's not too bad ... If you 're in bright light scenarios . Once you get regular light -LRB- i.e. a typically lit indoor room , or a room with natural light coming in -RRB- and low light , it gets really grainy . I also realized that you do n't get 1080 unless u use the FXP 12mbps mode . Otherwise it 's slightly less resolution and not true 1080 . But the biggest kicker that made me really dislike this camera was the noise that comes from the camera and manages to seep into your video . Unless you 're shooting a loud scene , you will notice an audible , fast , repeating `` Clacking '' sound seep into your video . This was the killer for me . I plan on using my next camera for some semi-professional projects . The part that I do n't get is why it makes this kind of noise from a Flash Based camera !? Additionally i do n't like that you ca n't put on additional lenses , the auto focus is pretty slow to react . Image stabilization is useless even slightly zoomed in -LRB- Dynamic IS helps a little but not much -RRB- . No place for a light attachment . The microphone input is nice , but if you 're using a wireless mic , the camera person is going to have to hold in his hand or pocket the receiver . I did n't try the editing software that came with the Camera and used Final Cut Pro instead . It worked fine with that using the `` Log and Transfer '' option . FCP works with the files just fine . The drawback to the file format that this file uses is that it needs to be converted for a mac to read it by default . Did n't try any other programs to view the video so i ca n't comment on which programs will work on the Mac . Bottom Line : If you are just shooting to shoot family vacations or something that may not be seen by a bunch of people ? This is n't that bad of a camera for that . However if you care about the quality and the ability to do more than just point and shoot , skip this and spring for a higher model like the HF-M30 . 	Camcorder
It works really well . perfectly actually . My camera was having problems with playing tapes , told me to clean heads many times and I tried another brand and that did n't work , almost sent it in for repair . Ran this tape for 10 seconds , works great . Less dropouts then when I first bought the camera ! 	Camcorder
THIS CAMERA TAKES GREAT HD VIDEO . It is simple to use and connects by hdmi directly to your TV . The video is stunning . Please , I do n't want to hear that the cable did not come with the camera . When you buy the camera order the cable . I purchased three on Amazon for $ .59 each and the shipping still cost more than the cables and they work great . Buy an extra battery they also can be found inexpensively along with an external battery charger . My only complaints about the camera are the wide angle at zero zoom is pretty tight -LRB- I should have checked the specs more carefully -RRB- and since the camera only has the lcd screen - pointing it in bright sunlight and getting what you want in the picture can be a challenge . Practice shooting without using the screen until you know where to point it without looking at the screen . -LRB- its digital and does not cost anything to practice -RRB- By the way the camera stays in the zoom position it is in when you turn it off and when you turn it back on it is still in the same position . The size and weight make the camera pocketable if you are wearing a mans shirt with pockets just put a neck strap through the hand grip to prevent accidents That being said , understand unless you have made or are going to make the investment in a HD dvd player and HD dvd burner , software that can edit and burn HD video disks you will only see DVD quality video on the disks that you burn . The software that comes with the camera did not need to be in the box . Go buy hd editing software . Final verdict . Good camera , light weight , small but not to small , great quality video , still pic quality good for what it is -LRB- steal frames from video just as good -RRB- just understand the HD camera is just the beginning if you want HD on your tv screen , unless your tv has a card reader then you store your HD video on HDMC cards and eat the cost of cards .

I 'll keep it simple . Lots of neat bells and whistles . Small camcorder that works like full size VHS . Has a nice adaptor for the VHS VCR . I tried other camcorders and full size VHS cameras before I bought this one and it was the closest to working like a full size camera . It is very light weight even with the battery on it . Your arm does ' t get tired from holding it up . It is also nice to have the LCD when you want to tape your whole family you do n't have to look in the view finder to be sure it 's lined up right . You just turn the LCD screen to face the front of the camera . 	Camcorder
Now , some individuals will try to convince you the XL2 is a poor Prosumer camcorder and will give seemingly good arguments . Do n't buy into it . For instance , a reviewer lower down this page complains the camera arrived broken and thus reviews it as a horrible machine . Unfortunately , this said reviewer does n't talk about the actual functionality of an actual undamaged product , rather his own broken camera . Needless to say , his opinion is vastly slanted . Another compares the XL2 to the DVX100 series from Panasonic and prefers the latter . He states the XL2 is too heavy and does n't achieve the same calibre results as the cheaper Panasonic camcorder . First of all , Canon has continued to revolutionize the photography industry for decades . They have proven themselves in both film and digital formats , for both still camera and camcorder . True , the XL2 lacks some features other more expensive cameras have -LRB- compare the JVC GU1000 -RRB- but that 's okay . And , yes , the camera has a very large body and is definately heavier than the Panasonic DVX100 , but this is for specific reasons . You have to first consider why you want a prosumer camcorder . If you just want to shoot hobby short films and want a professional look , I suggest you stick with either the higher-end Canon or JVC or Panasonic or even Sony -LRB- god forbid -RRB- consumer camcorders which run around $ 900 . On the other hand , if you 're considering becoming a serious hobbyist and do n't intend to turn it into some sort of profession then Panasonic 's DVX series is a good buy . The DVX 100 's are cheaper , smaller , and somewhat easier to use . They are far more `` point-and-shoot '' than the other prosumer camcorders on the market . And they do a fairly good job . Yet , the XL2 manages to not only hold its own , but also triumph over all other camcorders in the industry . First and foremost , the XL2 has the option to change lenses . This is a great boon for any serious shooter because attaching an actual lens to a camera gives far better results than slapping on some sort of adapter , which distort the image . Canon offers two lens types for the XL2 : the included 20X zoom lens and a 3X wide angle lens ; both are very expensive by themselves . But , with an optional Canon ring adapter running for $ 300 , you could take your normal Canon SLR still camera lenses and attach them to the body and have them function perfectly . This allows the user a plethora of imaging options when shooting . Now , the normal user wo n't ever use anything other than the 20X zoom lens -LRB- a remarkable piece of machinery in itself -RRB- , but that 's just fine . You 're buying the camera for its options and potentials as well as the physical benefits . Think of it like buying a BMW : you buy the car for its physical features you 're likely to use -LRB- the radio , heated seats , leather , sunroof , etc. -RRB- but you also buy it for its safety and cumstomer service , things you 'll hardly ever need . It just makes you feel good you have those options available . Furthermore , the XL2 is a wonderful camera . It shoots beautifully without problems of any sort . Yes , it takes some getting used to , but that 's because it has a lot of fuctions and options . The physical body design is simple enough that all the necessary shooting options -LRB- i.e. , 24P , 30i , 60i , mic adjustments , white balance controls , presents , etc. -RRB- are easily accessible . The end product of a regular shoot is stunning . The Canon lens captures colors almost perfectly and the image stabilization built into the camera is a great help . The large body design -LRB- though awkward for some -RRB- is actually a benefit . The camera can be placed on the shoulder , giving greater stability to the shoot . You ca n't do that with a Panasonic or Sony . No , the camera does n't have a LCD screen on the side , but do you really need one ? An LCD screen is not only distracting but also a battery hog , and takes precious room for control options or accessories that could other wise be placed where the LCD is built in . An LCD is great for consumer cameras because they 're small and nobody wants to look through those one-inch viewfinders . But the XL2 has a very nice , large color viewfinder , and can be comfortably used with the camera on your shoulder . For those running hand-held shots you can flip part of the viewfinder open and can see a 1.5 '' LCD display . It 's not dazzling or great , but it gets the job done . You 're out in the field to get footage , not admire the LCD screen . Finally , the XL2 offers XLR microphone inputs , a big bonus for people who want good sound in their video . You wo n't find this feature in either Panasonic or Sony prosumer camcorders . In the end , Canon 's XL2 is a beautiful camcorder . It offers you a lot more than you know at first glance , and delivers near-perfect results . The closest competitor would be the far more expensive -LRB- by at least $ 1000 -RRB- Panasonic GU1000 , which is very similar to the XL2 . If you 're still not sure about the camera , I suggest you take a ride down over to your nearest Fry 's to experiment . Or , you can visit the local TV station and ask them to tell you a little bit about why they 're all using XL2 's over the other camcorders on the market . No. . . seriously ... they are . Go figure . 	Camcorder
A beautiful camera , but a few annoyances ... <p> - Did not come with a case . - Did not come with a tape . - Comes with one battery and no external charger i.e. you need to charge battery in the camera so if you buy a second battery ; you also need to get an external charger . - MPEG movie mode to stick limits you to 15-second shots , even if you have enough memory to take more . Not sure why . Camera comes with 4mb , I bought an additional 128mb stick . - USB functionality is for the stick only i.e. you ca n't use the USB port to pull from the tape . For that you need a Firewire card . This makes sense , from a speed perspective but is not evident from the technical documentation on Sony 's site . It seems like an output port choice but there is none ; it 's either\/or depending on what you want to move to PC . USB driver provided by Sony sets the stick up as a removable drive - you can copy the MPEG 's and JPEG 's right over . - Firewire card I had was compatible with Windows ME but not with the software that came with the camera . The card does work with the native ME software -LRB- I think it 's : `` Windows Movie maker '' . -RRB- - Again , card and camera will not work with Adobe Premiere 5.1 c although the Adobe site says the most recent version will work with Card\/Camera combinations recognized by Windows . - Built in flash is adequate but if you need to take red-eye free shots consider the external flash - the red eye mode on the built in flash is n't always adequate . <p> Not a small camera but the size is well worth the trade off to get a two in one device i.e. camcorder that takes decent still shots . For those important moments you may fall back on your old 35mm or hi-res digital camera but the 1.5 mp images this camera provides should be acceptable for most occasions and not having to lug two cameras is great . <p> All-in-all , one of the best mid-level cameras out there - Sony just needs to charge $ 100 more and throw a few more accessories in the box .

This is one of the best camcorders that I 've ever owned . Try shooting in Full HD mode and connect it to a Full-HD LCD\/LED TV over HDMI ... The Video is stunning and mind-blowing ! Very easy to use and for $ 425 -LRB- the price I paid for this gadget at Costco -RRB- , I could not have asked for more -LRB- or anything better -RRB- . Lowlights : - The HDMI and USB ports are behind the LCD panel ... so need to leave the LCD open all the time when I do sync up or connect using HDMI - Still pictures are still a bit blurry -LRB- or noisy -RRB- - This is a low priority for me . - The Sony PMB software is very average . - Need a good HD video editing software + a high-end machine capable of editing HD content 	Camcorder
It does not come with the mike as shown on the picture . Mike sells separately . But for me the bilt-in mike is more than enough . I 'm using this camera since April 2003 . No defects , works perfectly , completely satisfied . It is recommended to use only one kind of DV tape for this camera . Choose either Panasonic MQ or PQ -LRB- or other professional quality tapes -RRB- and stick to them . Buy a clear protective filter -LRB- 72mm -RRB- and put it on the lenses as soon as you open the box . There is a great bag made for this cam by KATA -LRB- around 100 dollars -RRB- . Get an extra Battery -LRB- larger that the one that comes with it . Around 100 dollars -RRB- . The battery that comes with it will last about an hour . I bought an additional Panasonic camcorder for 300 dollars , just to use for rewinding and capturing tapes from DVX100 -LRB- there is no loss of quality -RRB- . This and the use of the same kind of tapes prolongs the life of camcorder -LRB- I do n't know exactly for how long , so you might consider not following my advice -RRB- . <p> Most of the newer Editing software is now capable to handle DVX100 24p format . This cam was released in December 2003 . As of December 2004 , in my opinion , it is still the best Professional camcorder in the price range of 5000 . 	Camcorder
When I first bought this camcorder in December 2000 , it seemed to work pretty well . But after 4 months , the zoom button broke . Then for no apperent reason the whole camcorder completley stopped working , so I had to send it to the JVC mechanics to get it fixed . When it was returned -LRB- after spending a lot of money to get it fixed -RRB- , it worked well , or so I thought . Only 2 months after having it returned , the zoom button broke again , and the viewfinder turned green . Not wanting to have to send it back again , I decided to live with it , but a year and a half later , the built-in lense got stiff and the view-finder turned solid white , not allowing me to even look through . About a month after that , things got worse -- the button which you press to record FELL OFF , the playback stopped working , and the viewfinder turned BLACK , rendering the camcorder useless . Shortly after it broke -LRB- for the second time -RRB- , I bought a different camcorder -LRB- the Panasonic PV-L452 Palmcorder Camcorder -RRB- and so far , it is working much better . If you are taking into consideration what kind of camcorder is best for you , do n't get this one , EVEN if you like VHS . I was also disappointed by the fact that this camcorder does n't have an LCD moniter -LRB- a screen that folds out -RRB- , that it does n't have a built-in light or nightvision , and that the battery does n't last long . Also , this camcorder only has a 90 DAY warrenty . If I were you I would n't spend over 200 $ to see this cheaply-made camcorder fall apart -LRB- which happened to me -RRB- . 	Camcorder
I have a HDR-CX110 . If I move the camera too fast -LRB- other than dead slow -RRB- while filming I get a breakup of the picture during replay on my computer -LRB- macbook pro -RRB- . The picture breaks up into little black lines mostly around black areas but in other areas also . Is this a setting problem or is the camera just a piece of junk ???? 	Camcorder
I wanted a simple little camcorder , so of course I first got a JVC HA camcorder . I tried it and found it difficult to deal with the big files , and if you are not a super model they leave you looking a little unflattering . Seriously , do I need anyone seeing that mole ? So . . When I looked for a standard def cam , I decided on this one after playing around with several other makes . I liked the simple controls and size . The batteries last a long long time , and with an 8gb SD card , I can take videos FOREVER it seems , even in HQ mode -LRB- Recommended -RRB- . AND THANK YOU FOR SD SUPPORT SONY ! Finally Sony is joining the rest of western civilization in this regard . I can not comment on Sony 's software because I use something else . Optics : Best I have found in this size range . Video quality : Exactly what you can expect for SD -LRB- which I perfer -RRB- . Battery live : Great . Size\/Weight : Great -LRB- not much bigger then a Flip -RRB- Software : N\/A After Playing with several different makes\/models -LRB- 8 in all -RRB- I found the DCR-SX44 to be the best for my needs . This DOES come with a USB cable and everything else you need . Hope this helps . P.S. I am generally a Cannon guy , but they really do not do as well with their camcorders . 	Camcorder
I used the camera on a trip to Hawaii and was quite impressed with the results . I did not notice the camera motor noise as others have noted . Even though I purchased an external mike to eliminate the reported noise concern , I never used it . Since most of the photos were outdoors and the pictures were more important to me than hearing other tourists make their ignorant comments , I never hooked up the external mike . In terms of the battery , I experienced 2 hours out of the standard battery if you use the viewfinder rather than the display screen . Power 2000 sells an extnded life battery for this camera -LRB- from 850 mah standard to 1,000 mah -RRB- . Unfortunately , my Power 2000 battery arrived at home after I had left on my trip so I could not test its added horsepower . Since the mini DV tapes only last an hour anyway , changing batteries with every other tape was not a problem . I would recommend purchasing a back-up battery and an external battery charger , rather than using the camera to re-charge batteries . Perhaps even better might be a charger with a an optional auto lighter cord so one battery can be replenished in the car while driving . Still two hours is pretty long for a single battery . Although there is an internal lens cover , I used a UV filter and although this protected the camera lens , shooting ocean photos meant cleaning the filter frequently from the spray . It was easy to remove the filter and clean it rather than touching the camera lens . The small joystick could be slghtly larger , but it is manageable . I found that in some cases to steady the camera from rocking or movement , I would use my left hand to block the camera and in this case it was almost more comfortable to operate the zoom with my index finger on the left hand . Again I am using the viewfinder rather than the screen to shoot photos . In terms of the zoom 20X is just fine ; any more and an individual can not hold the camera still enough for reasonably clear photos and a tri-pod is required . If you want more there is a 2X telephoto lens available pushing this camera to a 40X zoom . Similarly there are .5 X wide angle lenses available . I am pleased with the camera and its overall performance for the price . -LRB- I was able through Amazon to purchase it for less than $ 300 with the deals being offered . This left room in the wallet for a camera case , filters , lenses , battery charger , external mic , etc. -RRB- I have an older Nikon digital still camera , so the Canon was purchased for the express purrpose of taking videos especially outdoor views and met my expectations . I created a mount on my tri-pod where the Nikon and Elura could share the same three legs with the Nikon having a manual shutter release to minimize bumping the tripod . I was able to capture sunrises and sunsets in both video and still images . The compact size of the Elura was convenient in that it could be stowed in a pocket in my shorts leaving my hands free when not in picture taking mode . Each camera has its features and disadvantages ; I suggest you give the Elura 100 a test drive and see if it works for you compared to others on the market . 	Camcorder
I purchased my ES-60 about a month ago , so far I have had no problems with it , the quality is excellent , and the battery life is great . This is a great entry-level camera for the amature home videographer . The only reason it is not a 5 , is the menus at first seem a little confusing , so here is the simple way to navigate the menu system , hit menu to bring up the menu screen , use the wheel to select what you wish to do , and then hit focus\/set button to turn various features on and off .

Although not very compact , I 'm still consider the camera pocket-able . Moving from D-SLR to P&S is a big step for me . I 'm carefully searching for P&S camera that produce excellent image quality , great manual control features , great coverage for both wide & zoom reach , sharp , and great deal on price . I was considering LX5\/S95 earlier but due to its price , I 'm willing to compromise the low light capability with more reach zoom on ZS7 . To my surprise , everything that I was hoping for included in this camera . Excellent build quality -LRB- much better than my old canon -RRB- , super sharp lens , full customizable setting , great video performance . Pro : 1 . Excellent build quality . Metal casing from body to battery door . My old Canon SD800 battery door made from plastic . 2 . Super sharp lens . tested indoor with maximum zoom level , I was able to get very sharp pictures . Just like pic that came from my canon dslr lens . 3 . Despite for its limitation , I can set the camera to perform up to my standard . for example , I can set the isomax to 400 , therefore I can eliminate the noise issue in low light condition . And many more custom setting to choose from . Of course I still need sturdy hand or use tripod\/monopod in this situation . 4 . Great coverage both wide end and tele zoom . 12x zoom is equal to 300mm lens on DSLR . what a great reach for such small camera ! 5 . Excellent image quality & smart camera . I do n't have to decide whether I want to shoot macro , landscape or portrait . the camera can adjust itself depending on your situation . very smart ! 6 . Cool video reproduction w \/ stereo sound . Panasonic seems to think outside the box how to overcome the camera limitation . The zoom function for example will move slow during video recording . This allow us to get smoother movement and reduce zoom motor noise . Continuous AF also supported . You can get similar result like the one recorded with camcorder . Worry about the AVCHD lite format ? Good news is you can change the video format to motion JPEG which widely used by all video editing software including windows movie maker . For me , I like AVCHD better since I can take full video movie features that this camera promise . 7 . GPS functionality . automatically tag the photo & videos by detecting point of interest location from around the world . Just make sure you turn off this GPS features if you do n't needed as it will drain your battery even when your camera in off position . 8 . excellent 11 points AF tracking & continuous tracking . This camera also can remember your face -LRB- up to 6 faces -RRB- and prioritize the focus on these faces . 9 . Manual depth of field control . Whether you want blur background or sharp landscape shot , everything that you could possibly dream of from DSLR , you can have it in here . 10 . Various scene selection . some of my favorites : pin hole -LRB- vignetting effect -RRB- , High dynamic -LRB- HDR -RRB- . Update : Just found other cool things . Some of the scene selections can be applied toward video as well . For example you can have vignetting effect with desaturated color when recording movies . This is very cool ! Cons : 1 . No manual video control . I wish it has manual aperture control during video recording like LX-5 . 2 . small aperture . If the camera has larger aperture like f\/2 .8 , it will have better result in lowlight shot . 3 . Light streak during video recording . Exposing to bright light , the video can produce light streak during recording . This is not the camera fault . It is CCD sensor issue that applied to any camera using the same sensor . Some new camera used backlit MOS sensor to overcome this issue but there is a trade in effect which reduce still shot image quality compare to CCD sensor . For me I 'm still choosing CCD over Backlit-MOS . 	Camera
This camcorder may seem like a decent deal ... but by the time you add one battery -LRB- which is pretty much a minimum , since the battery life is so short -RRB- , and a charger -LRB- no. . . the camcorder really does n't come with a charger -RRB- you add 25 % to the price . Make that two batteries and a charger -LRB- the ideal kit -RRB- and you almost double the price . Without buying the charger , you are forced to use the camcorder as the charger . This is very inconvenient . Now , this would n't be a problem if they did n't have proprietary batteries or the camcorder did n't detect any attempts to use non-Sony batteries . You can get generic batteries on Amazon and elsewhere that say they will work for this model , but they will not . They 've recently updated the camcorder to detect more -LRB- or all ? -RRB- non-Sony batteries and give an error message , shutting down . Generic batteries that worked with the DVD403 do not work with the DVD405 . By the way , if you are considering some of their lighting accessories , beware that these also take their proprietary batteries , and probably a different model than you need for the camcorder ... leaving a whole ` nother set of overpriced batteries you have to buy . I bought this camcorder but I 'm not going to be buying any hundred dollar batteries any time soon so I sent it back . Sony is n't getting another dime from me . 	Camera
I purchased this camera after my FLIP generation 2 was stollen . -LRB- i loved my old FLIP . I was using it to film my childs `` firsts '' -RRB- Once i realized my camera was stollen I looked on amazon for another one , ignoring the bad reviews because I had such good luck with my old camera . I had to rush order the camera in order for it to be here and ready for my child 's first christmas festivities . I received it with in two days and immediatly took it out the box and plugged it in my computer -LRB- MAC -RRB- to charge -LRB- over night -RRB- . When i woke up in the morning , I removed it from the computer and tried to turn it on ... NOTHING . Thinking I had maybe plugged it in wrong , I tried again -LRB- this time checking to make sure the red light was on next to the lends and the screen was flashing the battery pack . -RRB- After 4 hours , i unplugged it and tried to turn in on ... NOTHING . In one last attempt I plugged it into my husbands computer -LRB- PC -RRB- . 4 hours later . . NOTHING . I called FLIP customer service and they told me to hold down the power button for 10 seconds and that would fix the charging problem . . Needless to say it did n't help and they said there was nothing else they could do . Obviously I returned the camera and am now waiting on the Kodak to arrive . . hopefully in time for christmas ...

Having used the G3 as a workhorse supplement to my DSLRs I kept holding off on the newer G series cameras . The ability to shoot HD video and smaller size finally won me over . The camera is solid and easy to use . I 'd like a couple of minor tweaks in terms of use , but the shutter response is fast and the exposures are well balanced . It is larger than most compact digital cameras , but the ones I 've used are challenged to make prints 20x30 or larger -LRB- focus and optical quality being the primary issue -RRB- . The G3 -LRB- at 4 MP -RRB- can take very good 16x20s , and 20x30s at lower ISO settings on the G12 are fantastic . One other note - the first camera shipped to me by Amazon was lost\/stolen in the mail . While I was stunned that they shipped a $ -LRB- ... -RRB- product without requiring a signature -LRB- the threshold is $ 700 -RRB- , they -LRB- Amazon -RRB- were fantastic . They immediately shipped a replacement camera and even expedited the shipping . 	Camera

I got this camera for my kids for Xmas . We used it often . It was taking pictures fine outside or in a sunny room . But any other pictures taken were dark . I could n't even find the target . I had to follow the lamp in the living room and move the camera down to floor where our dog is because the view window was black . Only the light stood out . I read all the directions one by one exactly as it said and it still takes crapy pictures . When you put the flash on the pictures come out when you look at them white . So bad you ca n't even see what the picture is . I tried taking a pictures of my sisters bridal shower today and now the pictures are coming out red . The cake came out with a flash all white . Nobody knew what it was . We thought for our first digital camera we would n't spend to much . It was small . You did n't need batteries . It had a charger . But I 'm sending it back . I thought maybe it 'd fix itself . So much for that . I wouldnt buy one . 	Camera

I suppose the `` little '' should be re-worded . It 's not the lightest , or smallest out there , by a long shot , but I really enjoy this camera . Sure , the floppy technology is going the way of the dodo , but it is still nice to have the convenience , to have it if you need it . USB is in use in almost all facets of life these days . You would have to have one extremely old and lacking P.C. to not have the USB port available . But , there are some out there . There are those times when the USB port wo n't read , when something is on the fritz , and you need that digital picture downloaded NOW . I ca n't say I 'm a professional photographer , I do n't judge the quality of photos for a living , but I do enjoy taking pictures . Between the multiple focus , lighting , and picture settings , you are allotted many options to make the next shutter sound capture a beautiful picture . I would have to say , professionally , you can find better . Can find items with higher resolutions , with quicker data transfer rates , etc. . But , for me , the camera is wonderful . During my time in the military I was deployed overseas , and the camera was by my side . If it can make it through 14 months in a desert , in the cargo pocket of a soldier , getting slammed around and whatnot , I 'm sure it 's a keeper . Overall , 4 stars from me . 	Camera
The D30 is a great camera and takes outstanding photos . I will put it up against my friend 's Nikon any day and his camera cost much more . The battery life on the D30 is amazing as I expected the same life as that on the Nikon . Instead , the battery on the D30 just keeps shooting after the Nikon is dead . This is not to knock the Nikon as it is one of the premier cameras around and is a true professional camera , but the Canon will match it picture for picture for less money . Either camera will make you a very happy photographer . I regularly use a Canon EOS 35mm . camera so the transition to the digial is very easy as the controls are so similar . The fact that I can use my Canon image stabilized lenses makes it even better . The D30 does call for one of the EX flash units , so that will add to the cost ; however , the on-camera flash also works well . Picture quality is outstanding . I have had no problem with the software , but I generally download all pictures to my computer and do any adjusting , etc. with Photoshop . Hookup to the computer by way of USB is a snap and downloading is fast . 	Camera

I think the T2i will do fine as a beginner 's DSLR -- just turn the dial to `` full auto '' and you will get a very acceptable and usually excellent picture every single time . But the feature set is extensive so it 's a great camera for beginners who want to grow . The only real big difference between the T2i and what the pros use is it 's not a full frame camera -- but you wo n't touch full frame for less than $ 2500 for Canon or Nikon . T2i low light performance , for anybody who has n't bought a DSLR in a couple of years , is astounding . Pretty much full detail at 3200 ? Crazy . I can take this camera out into the woods at night and get images of things that I ca n't even see with my eyes . If you graze the Amazon reviews you can find numerous anecdotal complaints about fuzzy images but I think it 's people who are messing with manual settings and not knowing what they 're doing . If you increase aperture you can lose sharpness . If you shoot in low light and the autofocus is struggling , you can lose sharpness . Use a tripod ! Use faster shutter speed and smaller aperture ! Take advantage of the camera being able to shoot at 1600-3200 with very little noise . Or if you ca n't or do n't want to figure it out , do n't be ashamed to turn the dial to green and let the camera do the work -- it will usually make very good decisions . Reports that 18 megapixels can mean less resolution than , say , 10 or 12 megapixel DSLRs are also not true and have been debunked . The reason people think that is that 18 megapixels produces such a large image that when you zoom in , you are more likely to see an imperfect focus or camera shake or an incorrect aperture . Since an 18 MP image is so much larger you can zoom in further . Sometimes you 're hitting the limit of what your lens can resolve -- if you need sharpeness for gigantic prints , you may have to invest in expensive lenses -LRB- though first , PLEASE , meet Mr. Tripod -- you 'll be amazed at the difference it can make in sharpness . -RRB- If you want to compare T2i performance to other dslrs in a side by side comparison , I recommend the imaging resource comparometer : -LRB- ... -RRB- ... The T2i 's images are terrifically detailed . Anyway , there are so many great camera choices out there . Probably this one is for people who want to do serious amateur photography and really need the camera 's capabilities to shoot landscapes , sports , indoors , wildlife etc. . For just general family pictures indoor and outdoor the T2i is overkill -- there are great entry level DSLRs or Micro-four-thirds cameras that will produce fantastic images up to 13 by 19 -- which is as big as most people would ever print . I 'd actually look at the entry level Olympus DSLRs -LRB- small and wonderful -RRB- and the Micro 4-3 Panasonic G-series and Olympus E-P series . 	Camera
I purchased this camera to give to my 6 year old to take pictures on the trip . After reading reviews thought that although light weight it would be perfect for her first big girl camera . It was such a HUGE disappointment for both her and I. The buttons did not respond for her when pushed , the camera was difficult to change modes between reviewing pictures , turning on and off , and deleting , and would often get stuck in a mode and the only way to get it out of mode of reviewing or deleting was to open battery compartment to stop power . at any price this camera was a waste of time !!!!! 	Camera
I 've owned the Lumix LX-5 for about a month now and have carried it with me nearly every day and captured over 550 images in that time . I 've been using it to shoot mainly street photography at 28\/35mm in manual focus , ISO 400 , aperture priority and typically shooting from the hip . The depth of field indicator when in manual focus mode is invaluable for this style of shooting and I 've been very impressed with the quality of the images the camera produces when used this way . I 've also used it occasionally for more standard compact camera duty : family and friends candids during a birthday party , family portraiture , etc. . Speed from shot to shot left a little to be desired in some of these cases , but I shoot RAW and am not using a particularly fast memory card which may be contributing to the lag I 've experienced . My general impression after 30 days of shooting is that this is one of the best compact cameras with this feature set . I expect to continue to carry it with me and shoot every day . Key complaints that keep me from rating it at 5 stars are : \* grip ergonomics are poor if you have large hands \* LCD display performs poorly in bright environments \* imaging performance at speeds over ISO400 	Camera
Gorgeous , just gorgeous . The images just plain `` look '' better than any digital photo I have taken over the last 12 years . Anything I shoot looks great whether it 's a portrait , a landscape , the sky , a bannana or the texture of my house eave - I ca n't find anything it does n't capture with the quality and detail that makes it a piece of art . My 1st beef is that the display on the camera itself is better than any of my 6 laptop or pc displays or my HD flatscreen TV 's . My second beef is that I now have to upgrade my laptop to manage and modify the monster files it creates whether raw , hi qual images or the HD video . By beef , of course I mean Bonus , since now I MUST upgrade : -RRB- I 'll end with simply , WOW and I am so glad I Pre-ordered the T2i instead of settling on the available -LRB- and also fabulous -RRB- T1i ! Thank You Canon and Amazon ! 	Camera
Plusses - 12X zoom with anti-shake lets you take pictures of things that are difficult to capture otherwise . For example , I take quite a few pictures of my animals , and when you get close to them , they tend to move . This camera lets you maintain your distance and get a good shot . - Video mode is good . High res , and works surprisingly well in low light . - Very good ergonomics as far as controls are concerned . Menus for various camera modes are well laid out . - Exceedingly fast operation . Turn it on , and it is ready to go . Repeated shots are also very fast . - Easy access to real time histogram of current image . - Reasonably powerful flash . - Great macro and super macro mode . - Takes AA batteries and SD cards . Minuses - Small LCD display , but with some use , you 'll be able to tell if you got a good shot or not . - I think familiarity with some of the other picture taking modes of the camera is a must -LRB- i.e. aperture and shutter priority modes -RRB- . - Some purple fringing at high zoom . - Noise in images , even at low ISOs . - Some difficulty focusing in low light situations . I have n't noticed any problems with capturing video to my SD card , like the other reviewer mentioned -LRB- I have a Kingmax platinum card -RRB- . Nor do I think the SD card door is ` flimsy ' . It is thin to be sure , but I 've never had a problem with it . I think color saturation is fine . Color balance is very natural on normal setting . Vivid color setting produces rich color . Battery life seems decent to me , I use high capacity NiMH cells . Overall , this is not a SLR , but you 're not paying the same money either . Overall , I think this is a decent camera and worth the price . 	Camera
Paid even more for this at Target I think almost $ 60 . Mic does n't even work , video is like 1\/5 the quality I get on my iPhone , of course -- there 's no audio , so you ca n't even compare . Too bad , it was a Christmas present for my daughter and it 's going back tomorrow . Target\/Amazon should n't even sell junk like this . 	Camera
From the packaging it looks very nice . By no means does it look like the super expensive cameras but it seems like a perfect fit for my stepdad 's hunting trips . I also purchased a memory card as it says there is not much memory included on the camera itself . Hopefully it works well too ... 	Camera
I bought my 7D in January of 2010 . I 've used this camera for a quite a bit , both in still and video capacities . I 'll review both separately to explain the pros and cons of each side of the camera . Stills : Pros : - Awesome ISO range and low noise - Great autofocus -LRB- really , really fast -RRB- - Frame rate is ridiculous -18 mp is wonderful . Great detail . - Custom Picture Styles are extremely satisfying . Considering I 'm more of a video person than a photographer , I 've really come to appreciate the stills this camera produces . They are clear , even in horrible lighting conditions . Even photos taken in ISO 3200 have very little noise . I shoot in Manual mode , but when I need to get photos taken in a quick second , I find myself flipping it to Green Box mode and clicking on auto focus and firing off a few frames within a few seconds . The photos are awesome . Considering I photograph events , this has saved me a few times . I bought the camera body only so I can use the extra money for a 3rd party lens , the Tamron 17-50 F\/2 .8 . Its a great lens , but the range is clearly designed for `` walking around '' which I do , but when I am a good distance away , the 50mm end of the range is usually not close enough , and not sharp enough . I do have to say , for a semi-pro camera , the still side of the camera is the highlight . There are very little things to complain about . If you have the lenses you need , this camera will make those lenses create wonderful images . Now for the cons : Video . Video : Pros : -1080 p resolution \/ 720p at 60fps . - Manual controls during shooting . - Compact body and weather sealed Cons : - Rolling shutter Rolling shutter is when the camera takes a frame by `` rolling '' the scan lines of the CMOS sensor downwards instead of exposing the sensor all at once -LRB- called `` global exposure '' -RRB- . This is especially obvious in high action scenes and flashing lights . Shooting at 720 at 60fps , it is reduced , but it is still evident , especially in a moving car and looking at tall objects like trees and poles -LRB- they appear to lean -RRB- . This camera is best used in low action scenes with a stabilizer like a tripod or shoulder mount -LRB- which kind of defeats the purpose of having a portable camera -RRB- . - Chroma sampling I understand that some of the readers wont know what this is . But for the film people who are considering buying this camera , this is for you . The sampling ratio is 4:2:0 . Which isnt prime for green screen . But another side effect is color grading is affected by this . It creates unsightly artifacts in the footage . There are tutorials online on how to upload custom picture styles to greatly increase the dynamic range of the camera -LRB- and custom Picture Styles to create amazing colors in the camera -RRB- , but there is one more thing that affects the footage : Noise . - Noise Reduction The noise reduction in video is no where near as good as the picture side of the camera . Considering that some might not have the best light available , they 'll have to boost the ISO , and once it peaks past 1000iso , the noise becomes more evident . Canon markets this camera as a monster in low light situations -LRB- which it is -RRB- , but the noise is very painful to see , especially when the footage is mixed with HVX-200 footage . The difference is obvious . So , since a good portion of buyers will not really care for the video , most of my cons are irrelevant . It 'll be a wonderful camera for the birthday clips and holidays . But for people who want to buy this -LRB- or the 5D -RRB- for film production -LRB- as I did -RRB- , the limitations should be considered . It is a good camera for dramatic films with little to no action . But , action is a difficult thing to capture on this camera without it looking gelatinous . Overall , its a great camera . Actually , this is a wonderful camera . It is limited in the video side , but for a $ 1700 , it offers a relatively inexpensive high definition capability -LRB- most film quality HD camcorders are $ 3000 + and they have inadequate lenses -RRB- and a great `` equalizer '' for film students or indie film productions . For an example as to how the camera deals with concert areas , I have this video I made . Look at the strange lines created in the flashing lights . Also , be warned , this camera will be destroyed if lasers hit the sensor -LRB- as shown is certain videos online -RRB- . -LRB- ... -RRB- . 	Camera
1 . Love this camera ; Kodak has finally got it right . Buy one you will love it . 	Camera
Enfoque rapido y preciso , el manejo de rangos dinamicos muy mejorado , la funcion de auto HDR y Panoramica es una belleza , adios Photoshop con estas opciones , lo he probado con el lente Kit y es muy bueno -LRB- SAM lens -RRB- tambien con un Minolta-maxxum 50mm F\/1 .7 y el 75-300 F\/4 .5 -5.6 y he notado que con los lentes sin motor -LRB- SAL lens -RRB- tienden a tener un poco de backfocus , despues la imagen , la rapidez de su rafaga de 7fps , ISO plenamente usable hasta 1600 -LRB- para mi gusto -RRB- todo esto hacen de ella una de las camaras mas economicas y versatiles para fotografia , su video no me gusta , no tiene muchas variantes y el formato AVCHD no puedo ver con mi linux , en video la canon le pasea lejos . Conclusion , para fotos tenes una posibilidad ilimitada dependiendo de tu capacidad y los lentes que tengas , en video solo para cuestiones casuales o familiares . Saludos desde Paraguay . 	Camera
I just bought the FI8904W camera to go along with the Foscam FI8918W camera I bought earlier . I was disappointed to find that the field-of-view for the FI8904W was much tighter than the F8918W , even though both are title listed by Amazon as `` 3.6 mm lens , 67-deg viewing angle '' . I went to the foscam.com website -LRB- not foscam . us -RRB- and found the spec sheet for the FI8904W . It states a `` 6mm lens and 42-degree viewing angle '' . I found that the narrow FOV made it inadequate for outdoor patio coverage . -LRB- For the tinkers out there you can buy replacement lenses . Google `` IP camera lenses '' -RRB- . It 's really too bad it does n't come with the same lens as the FI8918W . Also , the camera does not have auto-brightness , which can be a problem if you want to view in both bright sun and darkness . On a positive note , it was not too difficult to set up in both wired and wireless modes and the construction seems solid and water resistant . I returned mine but would have kept it if it were n't for the narrow FOV . 	Camera
I love this camera . I purchased this one to replace my old old camera -LRB- only 2MB picture -RRB- . The results are amazing . I 'm happy that I do n't need to use flash for low light settings . The auto mode is fantastic for people who just started to use this camera . I 'm going to try more scene modes . The screen is wide , I like it . 	Camera
This little Gem was the answer to my Video Prayers . I wanted to purchase an action camera for my cycle riding videos but did not want to pay a huge price for a Go Pro or something similar just yet . This camera gets some of the best Non-HD video I have seen . It does have a quirky way that you have to dislodge the camera if mounted on its right hand side but after some practice its a snap . You cant go wrong with this camera if you want some action video without busting your budget . Makes a great entry level camera until you can graduate to HD . The MIC on this baby is very sensitive so you may have to baffle it for wind noise . Also you will not be using this camera at night and to get the very best video possible use in full daylight . I like it so much I purchased a second one ! 	Camera
I wanted to see how well this camera would actually function as a carry-around for quick grabs of interesting things which happen too fast to dig a camera out of a bag . Being very pocketable , it is easy to carry in shirt or pants pockets , provided you take into consideration the delicate nature of the LCD screen and thin lens cover . Anyone who reads my other reviews of cameras and electronics will know that I am no fan of proprietary rechargeable batteries . I think they are wasteful and unnecessary complications , requiring one to purchase extra batteries which can only be used on one device , then must be discarded . Given that we already have international standards for battery designs -LRB- including rechargeable -RRB- , I find it a poor design choice created primarily to bilk customers out of more hard-earned cash . That said , I will have to admit that this camera has changed my mind a little in that regard . I am still using my very first charge on the included battery , and have not had to recharge it yet . Now , I only shoot it for limited periods of time , and not every day , but the charge is holding far better than I expected , even when not in use . Another strong point is that I can get extra batteries from a third party for little more than the price of a 4-pack of lithium AA batteries , which means that I can easily carry several charged batteries for about the same cost as one-use batteries . This makes it much more attractive , even though I am still limited to the charged batteries I have on hand . I have even bought 2 extra batteries to test this out . I will update if there are any significant additional things to report . The other thing that has made this camera far more attractive to me is its macro capability . As an old geezer with eyes not quite so good as in my youth , I find it more and more difficult to read the increasingly microscopic text being printed on increasingly smaller electronic devices , such as wall wart power supplies , and have found that this camera works extremely well for taking pictures in macro mode and zooming in to make them very readable . I have also used this camera to reach inside equipment racks to take pictures to document equipment connections -LRB- which were undocumented -RRB- before making changes or moving gear . It has worked very well for that . It has become my camera of choice for everyday carry-around use , and although it is not as easy to use as my favorite Canon 720 IS , I am finding that it functions reasonably well for most things . The lack of an optical viewfinder makes it difficult for those of us with glasses , especially in the bright sunlight , but the LCD can be made bright enough to see well enough to frame shots with an acceptable level of usefulness . It would be better if the LCD were not glossy , however , as reflection in bright light makes it more difficult to use . The picture quality is good , although I have n't done any hard comparisons with my other cameras yet . I was shooting at the 5 megapixel size for a while to save space on the 1gb card , but have since replaced that with an 8gb card and will test at full resolution . All in all , I am happily surprised and looking to using and testing this camera more in the future . I will update with any significant information . Within its limitations , I would recommend this camera . UPDATE No. 13 , 2011 I used the video recording feature for the first time recently , and I was extremely impressed . The video was very clear and sharp , and the audio was amazing for the tiny mic placed on top of the camera . The more I use this camera , the more I like it . It has become very useful in my life . UPDATE : Dec. 17 , 2011 I have seen some references to Panasonic has changing their batteries in later models so one can not use third party batteries , but must purchase the vastly more expensive Panasonic ones . If that is true , that makes this camera even more valuable , as one can still get replacement batteries from third parties . Shame on you Panasonic , if that is true . 	Camera
I bought this camera for my son in June of 2010 , just about 13 months ago . I own multiple Digital SLRs , but this was for he and his mother to use periodically . The camera was taken to a Boy Scouting trip , on a school trip to Philadelphia , and to a few elementary school events . I 'm guessing the camera has taken 250-500 pictures in total . The zoom no longer works . It simply stopped . The cost to repair is greater than the cost of the camera . Now the camera itself still works fine , we can take pictures , but the ability to use the 3.6 X zoom is gone . I 've tried countless internet suggestions\/fixes to no avail . Google search `` Nikon Coolpix known issues '' - lens errors are super common and happen frequently . The # of `` out of the box '' lens issues is a bit scary . As far as pocket\/purse digitals go , this is the worst we 've owned -LRB- this is our 4th -RRB- . I had a lot of hope for it . From a form factor perspective , it was perfect and looked great . But it does a terrible job re : image quality and we end up with an inordinate amount of blurred photos compared to our others . Anyway , buyer beware . I 'm on my 3rd SLR , 2nd digital -LRB- one an 18MP version -RRB- . While I 'm no professional , I know enough about digital cameras to say this one is shoddy at best . 	Camera

This is the first product I have ever purchased from Samsung and have been dissatisfied with . It is a very expensive piece of -LRB- ... -RRB- The videos are fuzzy at best , there is absolutely no taking videos in dimly lit areas and the digital camera photos come out looking like black and white photos . You must change the settings from inside and outside constantly and the color is mediocre at best . I also had disc errors . Anything recorded prior to the disc error you lose . Can be quite frustrating especially if your recording a special event . I would actually give this product ZERO stars but that is n't an option . It is worth returning to best buy and losing the 15 % restocking fee . Spend an extra $ 200 and buy something a little more than the low end DVD camcorder . 	Camera
I still own my Nikon D60 but decided to move up to a D300s after researching online at several of my forums and the Nikon website . Since it 's arrival , I have been extremely impressed with the the build quality , image quality and flexibility in control of the image making process . In fact the camera is extremely complex and does require a steep learning curve to master . The camera can still be set up as a `` point and shoot '' for family snapshots but allows many creative image controls for the professional in all of us . Just a great camera !! 	Camera
I am satisfied with the purchase and wait for the camera from the description is very well and so far I have not had any problems 	Camera
I 'm happy with the camera , but find that it does n't always take photos that are as good as the little canon p & s I used to have , because I 'm not particularly adept at working it or choosing the settings . PROS : There will NEVER be a `` lens jam '' EVER ! -LRB- I 've lost 4 cameras to this error , why I went with a micro 4\/3 -RRB- Much more compact than a standard DSLR Decent zoom - I debated buying another lens but this is sufficient for my needs Photo options I like : pop art , soft touch , etc. . Easy to work menu options - I was a little nervous about this because I 've owned only canons for close to 20 years Price CONS : As other reviewers said , it is n't the best at taking photos of moving kids -LRB- sensor issues ? -RRB- . Unfortunately for me , that 's basically what I 'm taking pictures of . There is one setting I use that 's a sports option that does a decent job , but I find that there are still more pictures with movement blur than with my point-and-shoot . The battery charger is bulky - but you can buy a compatible , generic wall plug-in for about $ 5 Though smaller than a DSLR , it 's definitely not a pocket-sized camera For the price , I do n't think you can beat this camera . I know it 's technology from a couple of generations ago , and likely the PEN E-PL3 is a better camera , but I was thrilled to get it for about what I 'd pay for a higher-end p & s. Like I said , I 've lost 4 cameras in 6 years to the dreaded lens jam , and wanted to spend my money on something that might last longer than 13 months . The camera has a really solid feel and I think once I learn better how to use it I will be thrilled , not just happy to have it . 	Camera
I searched for months for the perfect video camera , and this was it . It has every feature I wanted except the external light , which isnt necessary since it can record very well with cats eye in total darkness . I never had a pixellation problem , and I used Panasonic miniDV tapes . I 've had this camera for about 5 months , and just recently it started having a problem . When I put a tape in , it says `` Eject the Cassette '' and will not play or record a tape . ... Also , it would be nice if the camera were about half the size , and had microphone output . 	Camera
This is a great camera for those of us that do n't know a whole lot about photography . The instructions and controls are easy to follow to make great photos . It does much more than I have experimented with yet but I know it will be fun and easy to try new things . 	Camera
If any other company made this camera it would be a 5 star winner in all categories . Unfortunately , it comes from Kodak . With a century of experience , the company clearly knows how to build a great product . However , it still has n't learned about customer service , support or software . There is no editing software included . You can simply import the video in its proprietary format and send it to Facebook or two other social network sites . Suppose you simply want to string together a few clips , add a title , delete a bad spot in the video and email it . or that you need the competitor 's lip camera which comes with great software and customer support . Forget about it with Kodak . The thinking behind the Zi8 -LRB- who came up with THAT catchy name ??? -RRB- begins and ends with the hardware . With all the features built into the unit it outshines every other similar unit in the marketplace . But the team fumbled before they got to the goal line . One good firmware update and some decent editing software which includes easy email , and this is a complete winner . As it is currently , it 's an almost great video camera . 	Camera
Purchased the SL 980 Sealife Video Light last year prior to a Tahiti diving trip in March . The light worked once at about 60 feet for a minute of filming . Turned light off until I wanted to use it again and the light would not turn back on . Once back in the boat and after removing and reinstalling battery compartment the light worked again . Same thing happend on the next dive . Received a replacement Video light once I returned from the trip . Took my next dive trip to the Caribbean this February with the new light and the same thing happened again . Light worked one time while down under pressure up to 70 feet then would not turn back on when needed . Once back in the boat and battery case removed and reinstalled the light did turn on but could not be turned back off . After a couple of days the light worked properly again . Soooo Disappointing !!! Now I have send back this light and wait for a replacement . There never seems to be an answer as to why this is happening and since I live in Colorado there is no way to test the new one prior to going on my next annual trip . 	Camera
This is a great little camera for folks who want hi quality photos and video capability in one camera . I got one when they were first released and thoroughly enjoyed it until I tried the Canon 10D SLR Digital . Now I have two 10D cameras . I use the F828 as a back-up video cam or carry it in my pack when I do n't want the extra weight of the 10D . My main reasons for preferring the 10D are : quicker manual adjustments , more intuitive feel , better photos , multiple lens options , great tech support . If I could only have one camera , and wanted to take photos and vids , I would choose the F828 . Otherwise I would go with the Canon 10D or 20D and get a stand-alone video cam . 	Camera
I felt the price was very competitive and it was received within the time frame the seller told me it would be . The camera is very easy to handle and has so far taken wonderful shots . It was just what I was hoping it would be . 	Camera
I bought these after my son lost my Sightron SIII compact binocs . My Sightrons were over $ 300 , and I 'd put the optics on these as equal . The color filter really does work to bring out browns\/animals from the greens . I initially wished I had bought the 8x28 , but the refurb price on the 8x22 was so good I could n't pass them up . I 'm glad I did n't ! These definately are for still\/stand hunters , not for someone who will be glassing all day . Due to eye fatigue , these hunters will need 8x40 or bigger . They are also nice to keep in the truck ! Enjoy , and good hunting . 	Camera
Bought this last year but felt remiss in not giving a ` high five ' review to Panasonic on Amazon . I 'm no photography expert but this camera has allowed me to seem like a professional ; the features are incredible . So far I have simply used IA mode and it takes some of the finest photos . For many years we used a Nikon and have many travel photos hanging on the walls . But this is the first digital I ever owned . Would highly recommend it to anyone who is interested in high quality images , ease of use and simple features . GPS system is nice also . When first bought I had to film some indoor scenes for business using HD recording . When played they were documentary quality like you might view on HDTV filmed by a professional camera crew ; really sharp , with excellent sound . I am thankful for making , what turned out to be , a very good decision in buying this camera . I was reluctant since Panasonic did not seem to me to be a `` camera company . '' They have done a great job with the Lumix DMC-ZS7 . Of course , I bought this on AMZN and got an excellent deal -LRB- as always . 	Camera
I have enjoyed my camcorder . Still learning more about it . I would highly recommend it . 	Camera
I bought this in July 2010 . It was great when it worked ! A few months later , it stopped working . It was not damaged in any way , but it no longer turns on . In addition , the battery door does not open normally . This is actually the second Nikon I owned . I had bought a L18 that stopped working too . I will stop buying these affordable cameras . I would rather invest more money in something that wo n't break . Will be selling it for parts ... 	Camera
I have been working for a major daily newspaper in Baltimore for 2 decades . Perhaps that will qualify me as an expert in photography . I have been shooting digital imagery since the late 1990s . Maybe that qualifies me as an expert in digital photography . This may be long - winded , but it 's extensive and can be useful . I received the Nikon D2H camera -- 2 bodies total -- over one year ago . I think I got them shortly after the D2H system was released in 2003 . Since then , I have used them to shoot images of all types -- documentary , sports , daytime , available light , flash , and dead - of - night -- for the paper I work for . This is the only camera I work with . First , please read the manual . There is a ton of information there , and the information is terrific to begin with . The D2H is highly - configurable , with screen after screen that you can set for your own specific use -LRB- resist lending the camera to anyone for a long period of time , for your camera may be returned with many of your settings changed so much that it acts like a thoroughly different camera -RRB- . I 'll just punch right in to the way it feels . The camera is a rather heavy beast , and for some , there can be an amount of shoulder or neck fatigue when using it for hours per day , like I do . But the camera feels well in hand and the controls are easy to move through . I 've long since given up using any camera bag . All I have are a fanny pack for a 14mm , 55mm , teleconverters and 2 extra camera batteries and flashes clipped to its belt . And the D2H 's hold the 17-35mm Nikon and the 80-200mm Nikon one - touch or the Sigma 120-300mm 2 - touch . Shooting is a breeze . The batteries let you shoot long before the need to recharge . I have my D2H set on ISO 200 or 400 most of the time and sacrifice shutter speed for lower ISO as often as I can , because the higher ISOs bring digital noise and a loss in color saturation . Just today , I purchased digital noise plug ins for Photoshop to limit this , and that 's a wonderful thing to invest in with this camera when you must shoot action photography with no flash at ISO 800 and above . I now have little problems with capturing images in even barely - limited lighting . I recently shot stars and a plane wing from my seat of an Airbus at 36,000 feet over the Pacific at 30 seconds wide open @ f \/ 2.8 , and it looks tons better than night shots via the D1H , which lacked the internal digital noise filter . That filter kicks in at around 1\/2 second and longer exposures , and can make you wait as long as your image you 've shot to strip your long exposure of much of the digital noise . When you shoot this way -LRB- and in general -RRB- , do n't simply react by cranking up ISO because you will not be happy with your results . The camera can be loud . At over 7 frames per second , it can make you obvious in a quiet room . Shooting sensitive situations can be testy , so limit your shooting to single frames . I wish this camera had an option to silence this camera , but since the mirror has to raise and lower , there 's no chance to do this . Am I happy with the D2H ? Definitely , yes . Are there improvements that can be made ? Yes . But the benefits outweigh the drawbacks . People have been bailing out of using the Nikon system and going Canon , which has some incredible gear , I wo n't deny that . But instead of simply giving up on your system of equipment , learn how to use the D2H well and you 'll be much happier than ever . And that means you should push its qualities to the max while respecting its limitations . For instance , white balance . This can be the best thing for you , or the worst thing you 've ever dealt with , depending upon how you approach it . Daylight , gray skies , dusk and dawn are easy , because you can set the camera to daylight , flash , shadow -LRB- for dusk and dawn times -RRB- and even the fluorescent and incandescent tend to be right in the ballpark . But the horrible mixed light or the street lamps that glow blue\/green or orange - red from mercury vapor can be the death of an image if you do n't properly use white balance . Preset white balance is king , here . I can get gray , black and white when I preset in mercury vapor light . And I used the preset for any light that the auto white balance setting ca n't figure . There is also a setting to dial in kelvin temps as well ! If you do this -LRB- and I can go on for miles here -RRB- , you 're on your way . So , with trying this D2H , or considering it , read through some of the digital D2H forums and ignore the posts that slam the camera without giving instances . Generally , those who pan the camera have not tried to understand it . I can bang off images to disprove where they suggest this camera will fail . When you have decent light , you 'll have a decent image . But when you try to use it without learning how you can maximize the system , you will come about shooting images that are terrible and unprintable . In closing , I have not been paid by anyone , I have no Nikon stock and have no outside interest in writing this except that I 'm giving the D2H credit where it 's long overdue . 	Camera
"I have been an ardent user of Canon products for 15 years , purchasing over 18 cameras , camcorders , and lenses . I use the cameras to photograph and film projects for marketing our company 's products . In other words I have always relied on Canon 's quality to support my job function . Next week I have a 4-day project in another state that requires low light filming that my HV20 is not good at . Maybe now is the time for me to move up to a more professional camcorder , such as a XA10 . After studying reviews I realized that there is a rattle problem with the handle . I called Canon Technical Support to see if the problem had been resolved and was told that it only occurred if the camcorder was shaken or that I could tape the switches . My reasoning is , why would I want to purchase a camera with a known quality issue for $ 2,200 and then have to apply tape for it to function properly . The technician agreed that if this was my feeling , I might want to consider the HFG10 as a low light alternative . Again I researched the reviews and ordered the HFG10 from Amazon . It was delivered Jan12th . Imagine my frustration when after three days of setting up the HFG10 , purchasing additional accessories such as , additional batteries , filters , power packs and 32GB memory cards , I found a fault with the memory card slot . It will not hold in and secure the memory card . I called Canon technical support and was told by both a support technician and a supervisor that I could send it back to them for repair . REPAIR , I have not used it yet , it has only been out of the box 5 times . `` Well that is our policy '' said the officious Canon supervisor , or you could send it back to Amazon for a replacement or refund . Conclusion : Obviously Canon has quality control , design and function issues and no concern for their loyal purchasers . Also , it seems they have little environmental concern for carbon footprint . Scenario 1 : I ship the HFG10 back to Amazon for an exchange , Amazon ship a replacement back to me . Amazon now ships the original camera back to Canon . Scenario 2 : It 's called customer loyalty or we stand by our brand ! I ship their HFG10 back to Canon ; they exchange it and tighten their <ahref=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004HW7DZM/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/192-0421392-5862146""> Canon VIXIA HF G10 Full HD Camcorder with HD CMOS Pro and 32GB Internal Flash Memory </a> Scenario 3 : In frustration of poor customer service by Canon , I send the HFG10 back to Amazon for a full refund and never purchase another Canon product . In today 's financial climate , we the customers are looking to purchase quality products at a reasonable price and have that company support their brand and their loyal customers . "	Camera
This camera is extremely easy to use . The touch screen menu feature is great for gadget freaks and newbies alike . The autofocus is very fast and the LCD screen is crystal clear . I managed to get 10 photos on the 8mb memory stick that comes with the camera which is fine if you plan to use this camera primarily as a video camera . It 's small design means it can be tucked out of the way on outings and whipped out at a moments notice . My battery lasts around 74 minutes and the Infolitium system , which tells you exactly how much power is left in minutes rather than the usual 3 bars , is really helpful . It can be a little noisy when rewinding a tape or changing modes but you dont hear anything while taping or reviewing . It 's small , sleek and really fun to use . I got this as a gift but if I were buying one for myself , this would be the one I would choose . 	Camera
The Telescope has incredibly poor magnification coupled with the image reflecting on itself and the inability to stay stable enough to rotate the focus while on the stand makes it useless and not fit for purpose . I did not bother to test the microscope as I have a gauge of the quality . I bought this item to encourage young scientists but it will only serve to discourage them . I am so glad I thought to test the product before wrapping it . Complete waste of money 	Camera
Why I gave it one star ? Because it does n't even power on although I bought it brand new . Of course I fully charged the battery ! Of course i tried new batteries . I called canon , canon said I had mail it to canon for services and i have to pay the shipping to the factory . I asked how long to get it fixed and they said at least a month . I asked can I get a exchange and they said no. . The body and lens are made with plastic . very cheap . For a product and services like this , it deserves 0 star . You gave it 5 star because you are lucky . 	Camera
The f\/1 .8 lens is one of this camera 's best assets . It has allowed me to get shots in low light or of moving subjects that were impossible with my previous point and shoot . Ergonomics are pretty good , with the exception of the macro function . Bettery life is sufficient for my use and comparable to my previous lumix . The camera generally does a good job picking exposure and white balance . The only things I do not really care for are the in-camera battery charging , and the use of a lens cap . Both are addressable with accessories , but portability suffers a little . Colors are a little too saturated on the OLED display , but the latter is fairly bright and usable in almost any lighting conditions . 	Camera
I have now done as thorough review of the image quality as I can . Using a tripod , with the subject about 8 ft away , a poster of Chinese characters , I took three shots on a timer at 4:3 aspect ratio , about 20-24mm focal length , using the D-LUX 5 , an older Lumix DMC-FX33 , and a Canon 550D with an EF-S 18-200mm lens . Then I looked at the images zooming in to the max . The Canon was by far the best , followed by the little FX-33 , with the Leica trailing behind , not very crisp at all . ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ 19 July 2011 : Final update . I think there is nothing wrong with the camera . Like other things , you just have to know its limitations . It is unreasonable to expect it to perform as well as a Canon DSLR . In retrospect I had unrealistic and amateurish expectations . With the various test shots in the previous update , I have now looked at them with both Lightroom 3 and Paintshop X3 , both RAW and JPEG -LRB- FX33 JPG only -RRB- . When I zoom in on each of the pictures , I get basically the same results as I did when looking at them via the on-camera LCD . But when I print A4 or even A3 size copies of shots I took along the Singapore River , the results are very satisfying . I 'll keep it and would recommend it to others . A bit pricey , but you get Lightroom . I am still surprised that the Lumix DMC-FX33 compared so well to the D-LUX 5 . ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ 20 August 2011 : After using it now for two trips to the USA and back here in Singapore , I must say that this camera is great and exactly what I was hoping for . The color rendition seems very good to my eye , the clarity of the image is very pleasing , it does a great job of sorting out that difficult balance of the sky and the earthly objects . I am a bit embarrassed for my earlier weak assessment . 	Camera
This is a piece of JUNK !!!!!!!! I bought it as gift for granddaughter . After lengthy process getting it open to install batts found that it would not work . I would not recommend this to anyone !! 	Camera
Okay , I just purchased this DVD403 and with in 1 hour had the same problem with my lens cover that I have read about all too many times -LRB- should have read this before I purchased -RRB- . I was just about to break the cover off when I read one review that stated that this automatic cover is VERY SENSITIVE -LRB- too sensitive if you ask me -RRB- TO DUST . So before breaking out the plyers or calling Sony -LRB- which I understand is useless and pricey -RRB- I decided to just pry open the cover and blow into this area to `` clean out '' and particles that might be in there . I honestly thought that this would not work but after 4 puffs I turned the camera on and THE CRAZY THING OPENED !!! I do not know how long it will continue to work nor do I know if this `` quick fix '' will work again but I thought that I would put this out there for anyone to try BEFORE dropping even more cash into the camera or trashing it altogether . I sure hope that this helps and more so I hope that it will continue to fix the problem when it arises . Sony really needs to get their act together in regards to this . I mean uncovering a lens is a small function and they can not get that right ? Come on Sony , step it up ! 	Camera
While the Pansonic D-SNAP has the potential for usable video quality , you need to realize that it is going to take atleast an additional $ 799 card to make it functional . To reach a useful quality , the D-SNAP uses a high speed Panasonic version of the SD card , which is now available as a special version 32x SD card by other sources . Today , people try to get the best price for a 30 - 60 minute DV tape at $ 5 . With the D-SNAP , you 'll be shopping for a $ 799 32x SD card , with 1 gig of storage , so you can move from 10 minutes of video to a whopping 20 minutes -LRB- which really is the bare minimum -RRB- at $ 799 . Also , beware that the manual is clear that the high speed write times will wear down the card , and you need to run special procedures to help reduce the errors which will start occurring . <p> The goal with compact devices is to make recording on the road possible . So if you can avoid 2 devices , one for STILLS and one for videos , this goal is possible . However , while most cameras today consider anything less than 2 megapixels -LRB- 2 million pixels -RRB- for STILLS bare minimum , the D-SNAP can only do .3 megapixel -LRB- 330 thousand pixels -RRB- . You ca n't even print a high quality wallet size . <p> The quality of the video is there with the D-SNAP . But the STILLs are completely unacceptable and you will be paying thousands of dollars to get 30 - 60 minutes of video . <p> The Sanyo Fisher is equally as compact , very solid construction , provides 3 megapixels for STILLS , and provides the resolution -LRB- 30 frames per second -RRB- and size -LRB- 640 \* 480 -RRB- required for TV . It also comes with a 512kb card , BUT it achieves 20 minutes of DVD-like quality or 45 minutes of VHS-like quality -LRB- which is very good -RRB- , out of the box . It uses more recent compression technology to write at multi-mb speeds on a normal SD card . You even get 30 frames per second to meet your 360 \* 240 PC requirements , which provides more than an hour of video . The interface is much better thought out on the Sanyo -LRB- everything is there at your finger tips , whereas the Pansonic makes you want to rip off the LCD at times because the controls are at the side -RRB- . The focus is 6x zoom optical on the Sanyo , instead of 10x like the Panasonic , which is still excellent . And the ISO levels and features are exceptional . Bottom line , you can live with any downside of the SANYO . You ca n't live with the downsides of the Panasonic . 	Camera
It is easy to set up . Image quality is average and construction is cheap , but hey , you get what you pay for . I would have given it a higher rating except for these caveats : 1 -RRB- Although Mac OS X is supported , you do n't get full functionality -LRB- e.g you do n't get zoom and preset views -RRB- unless you use Internet Explorer -LRB- that leaves Mac and Linux users out -RRB- ; 2 -RRB- its response to the web controls is inconsistent and slow ; 2 -RRB- it 's not really providing streaming video , it 's actually rapidly refreshing jpeg images ; and 3 -RRB- good documentation is hard to find . For expert documentation , see -LRB- ... -RRB- All in all , this camera is a good deal for the price and if you use Internet Explorer . 	Camera
We ordered this recorder just one week before our Honeymoon . The recorder arrived as promised and it worked great ! We could not be happier ! 	Camera
I loved the apperence of this camera ! I loved the slide down power on feature ! I loved the 5X zoomed ! So I bought it ! I had this camera about 45 days when I got these wierd looking lines that looked like black tears in the screen . It was wierd . They were n't just black lines they were a little jagged . So , I returned the camera to the store I bought it from and evenly exchanged it for the same camera ! Well about only 30 days with this camera and the same stupid thing happened again . I always kept the camera in a camera case , so I do n't know why the screen kept doing this . Along with the black lines , some of the pictures came out blury ! Image stabilization ... my foot ... when the image was stable and clear the photo would come out blury . More like reverse image stabilization . I just returned the 2nd go at this camera to the store and returned it for a Sony . I 'm bummed ! 	Camera
Camera arrived as promised -LRB- 2 day Prime -RRB- . Camera was easy to use and we began taking pictures immediately . The pictures are sharp and detailed and there is a lot that you can do with it . We will need to spend time reading the manual to learn about some of the more advanced features . We are delighted with our purchase . 	Camera
I bought this camera last summer when I was really wanting to upgrade to a DSLR and settled for an upgrade point and shoot . I was really excited with the zoom , which is an awesome feature , and all of the other in camera options . My biggest problem with this camera is the poor image quality in low lighting . The picture will seem to be okay on the LCD but once it 's on the computer it 's grainy and most of the time slightly blurred . As long as I 'm outside , the shots turn out pretty good . Still not as clear and bright as I 'd prefer , but not as bad as inside shooting . Also another annoyance is when you are in low lighting situations and you zoom in close , the camera wo n't allow you to take a picture . I was recently at a concert taking photos from about 25 feet back and it kept just focusing and not snapping any shots -LRB- which would 've been great at the moment I wanted to capture them ! -RRB- instead I got the sides of heads or eyes half closed . Frustrating ! A great feature with this camera is the options for sepia & black and white . Especially because you can change this setting while filming also . At the concert I attended the lighting was this awful red and I was able to switch to black and white and have a really good video . In all , if you take pictures outside in great lighting situations - you 'll love the options this camera has to offer ! If you 're looking to take pictures indoors , at sporting or other events - I would definitely skip it because you 'll find yourself frustrated like I still am . 	Camera
This camera has an awesome zoom capability . Works great as a pair of binoculars too . Some pictures will come out a little blurry if you zoom all the way -LRB- make sure you read the owner 's manual to find out some tricks to prevent that ! -RRB- . The remote control feature lets you take group pictures without having to set the time , run to the group and quickly pose . Just set the camera on a table -LRB- I use a tripod -RRB- , get your group together and click on the remote when you 're ready to take the picture . Love my camera ! 	Camera
If I could give a rating of 0 I would . I had this camera for about 3.5 months and maybe 30 minutes of recordings . I got the `` DEW DETECTED '' message and this camera has been useless since then . I would not recommend this camera to anyone . Save your money . 	Camera
This is an excellent camcorder . Virtually brand new and had many features ... especially the LCD panel . Tech for Less was outstanding for assistance in operating manual and quick shipping . Hard to find a VHS-C camcorder toady when everything is digital . Can now play all my old tapes . 	Camera
I got this thinking that it can be used during vacation but this is no good . Right from the day I received this is has double vision . Dont waste your money . 	Camera
The quality of this camera is great for someone like me . I am an amateur video maker and I wanted something thats full HD and good but not something above 550 $ . This is perfect inside , it reduces the grainy to almost unnoticeable , that is when there is not much light too . For outdoors it is absolutly wonderful ! -LRB- Almost every camera is but still -RRB- I love it . 	Camera
These are excellent binoculars and a great value buy . I wear glasses and I can leave them on and still use the binoculars in a moments notice for like bird watching or seated at a sports event . I would n't trade them . 	Camera
Hi , I 'm an amateur who likes to take nice pictures . I 've just got my brand new Canon EOS Rebel T2i body and gonna start trying it out soon . While picking up my camera at the postoffice , I 've recommended it to a friend and i would also recommend it to everyone thinking seriously about buying a good DSLR camera . Well , must say it 's not an entry level but an advanced photographer tool with lots of features and a clear friendly display . I 'm very glad with my choice and looking forward to have some fun also to share some shots with you in the future . I ` ts a wonderfull camera for my purpose and I realy like it .

I am a DSLR owner that does n't always want to lug around all the equipment and this compact does all the tricks I want it to . Its very impressive for it 's size and price . Recently , I had purchased the s95 and returned it when I found out this was being released . The s95 is a great camera however , I feel the s100 trumps it . The noise is greatly reduced in the s100 . The built in ND filter is an amazing addition , and the extra zoom and wide angle while it does n't seem like much , but is . I could care less about GPS but it might come in handy when I travel . All the complaints I am reading about AWB and tints seem either like a defective unit or user error . The AWB seems fine to me , and the screen is ultra crisp . If you are a quality control freak this is a great addition to your camera bag . I added two photos that show just how fantastic this little camera can be . I can not stress enough that DSLR owners will be impressed . 	Camera
I purchased this camera in January intending to use it for an April trip to Hawaii . I 've returned the camera twice for warranty repairs for the same problem . In fact , after three months the camera 's has spent more time under repair than with me . The problem appears to be a lens block which wo n't open rendering the camera useless for taking pictures . In the latest fix , I received the camera on Friday after the second repair and error appeared the next day as I was trying to take picures at a daughers event . I 'm disappoined in both the quality of the camera and the quality of the warranty repair service . 	Camera
I got two XF100s for my event videography business and after 6 months of use I can definitely say that these should not be considered a professional video camera . . But I 'll start with the good . What I like about the camera : The camera body is very small and light . What I hate about this camera : The main problem with this camera is that it is almost unusable in anything close to low light . The Noise produced at even moderate gain settings is enormous . I have had to use de-noising software on almost all the footage from this camera and that creates other problems with quality . . The button placements are not ideal for ease of use . there is only one ring that has to be used for focus\/zoom\/iris adjustment . So you have to press a button behind the screen in order to switch . Just not as user friendly as it could have been but not really too big a deal if you are not using it in a run and gun situation . . The viewfinder is unusable . Must use the screen which is not as high-res as the Canon SLRs . Yes the specs on this camera are impressive for the price but in actual use the single 1\/3 sensor can not handle the job . . For the same price you could get a canon slr that , while being much less easy to use , will produce much better footage . So unless you plan on using this camera on using this camera in perfectly lit conditions , STAY AWAY ! 	Camera
I have been waiting for an affordable Nikon digital SLR on which I could use my older Nikon lenses -LRB- AI , Series E , etc. -RRB- . I know , I could have spent thousands on a D2 , but that would have been overkill for me . Suffice to say , the D200 is a joy to use . It is fast , solid , and intuitive . For those owners of Nikon film SLRs who are considering a D200 , to me it `` feels '' just like a Nikon film SLR . I have previously owned several high-end digital point and shoot cameras , and the D200 blows them away in terms of its capabilities , the degree of control it offers , and the resulting quality of the pictures you can take with it . It has all the features an advanced amateur photographer could possibly want . I 'll probably never even scratch the surface of all of its features , but its nice to know they 're there if I want or need them . I highly recommend the D200 to anyone who , like me , has been waiting for the right digital SLR to come along . 	Camera
If you are anything like me and love Black & White Photography , but do n't want to do a lot of processing , this camera is great . The larger screen and the `` film type '' options are the main differences between this and the 20D and for my money well worth it . You get beautiful black and white results that have much more dimension than usual with a digital camera . I 've been shooting with it for a month or so now and really love everything about the camera . I purchased it as a second body and an upgrade to my Rebel XT . I could n't quite justify the money for the 20D , but with the added `` film style '' options on the 30D I felt I was getting another dimension that would justify the second body . Now I can carry them both hiking with the dog , have a short lens on one and a long on the other and not have to risk my sensor with in field lens changes . Aside from the black and white being much better than any other I 've seen with a digital camera the `` landscape film '' setting , not the fully automatic picture setting , but the film one really makes the greens in your landscapes pop . The `` standard '' setting gives you beautiful , accurate color and great skin tones . I have n't had a chance to play with the other two settings much . The camera is blindingly fast , I have to be careful to not fire off five or six shots the thing is so fast . The alternate 3 fps setting is a nice option to have if you have a slower lens and want to give it time to focus in a sports type situation . The only draw back I had was the size and weight of the 30D compared to my Rebel . I however , am one of the few people I know or have read about that felt the Rebel was the perfect size for my hands . Most people felt they had to add a battery grip onto the Rebel to have enough space to hold on to it . The 30D is much bigger and heavier and that takes some adjusting to , but I have been able to shoot great hand held stuff after just a little bit of aclimization . The battery life is also exceptional . I am still shooting on the original charge of the battery after a month of use . Going back to the black and white , you can also add `` filters '' to the monochrome settings that save you the cost of getting a red , yellow , orange or green filter to further bring out depth in different situation . I just love this camera . I would rather take the picture I want in camera than go home and play with an exposure that is n't what I had in mind with software and I really feel that I can with this camera . Total die hard Canon fan and started out with a point and shoot Canon two years ago . The quality on that was amazing and with this camera your imagination is your only limitation . I am also bad about reading instruction manuals and find that the menus are pretty intuitive and easy to use . I know I am not utilizing all the potential of this baby and I am still taking amazing photographs ! This camera is well worth the money for the serious amature . 	Camera
I 've owned the HX9V for about 10 months and it has provided the best video quality overall . It has better low light quality and image stabilization than the Panasonic FZ150 , Panasonic G3 , and even the Sony Nex-5N . The only time the Nex-5N could match the stabilization was when I used the 18-200mm lens , but that is very heavy and costs $ 800 by itself . Advantages over a traditional camcorder : - Compact - Wide angle starts at 25mm -LRB- most camcorder start at 30 or 35mm - 16x optical zoom - Amazing active image stabilization - Class leading low light video performance - Photo quality far better than stills mode on camcorders Disadvantages over a traditional camcorder : - No flip out screen or viewfinder - Smaller battery capacity So thanks to the HX9V , I 'll never need to consider a dedicated camcorder again . I use the 1080p 60p mode which is brilliant . Looks amazing on my HDTV played from either the camera or PlayStation 3 . Also looks great on my computer . 	Camera
My personal background : I 've owned several Point & Shoot cameras , both digital and film , as well as an old SLR back when I was in high school . I 'm a decent photographer and since I bought this camera in late August -LRB- now early November -RRB- I 've shot probably around 400 + frames . <p> If you want to shoot in manual mode , this camera works wonderfully . The only downsides I 've found is a tendency to under expose by about 1\/3 stop and the 1 fps maximum . If you do n't need high speed photography and can learn to compensate for the exposure -LRB- or take your film to a lab that does -RRB- there is n't a reason to buy any other Rebel . <p> If you use the various auto modes -LRB- landscape , portrait , etc. -RRB- you 'll find the camera works pretty well . Using these modes I can hand the camera over to a family member and expect the photo to come out reasonably well . <p> The only serious downfall to this kit is the lens . It is about as crummy as lenses come . The photos look fine at 4x6 , but if you blow them up , you 'll notice they are n't very sharp . The good news is that when your skill develop enough that you realize this , you can go out and buy that nice 24-85mm zoom and 50mm prime and they 'll work wonderfully . Expensive bodies are for people with money burning wholes in their pocket . This one is for you . : -RRB- 	Camera
I had the previous model of this camera and was very pleased with it . I could monitor my house from anywhere in the world . -LRB- Hi Kitty ! I see you . -RRB- One day it stopped working . I contacted the seller -LRB- SA Technology -RRB- They were very friendly and answered my e-mails promptly . Not only did they replace the camera , Jeff from SA Technology personally dropped it off at my house ! To add icing on the cake , the replacement camera was actually the newest model . I give this new model 5 stars and SA Technology 5 stars for customer service . 	Camera
The camera is exactly what I was looking for . I had already purchased this exact camera and was buying as a gift . The pictures are great . If you take time to work with the settings you can get really great images . I was also please with the cost . 	Camera
I 've owned a fair number of point and shoot digital cameras varing in price from the inexpensive low megapixel to the latest greatest , the later including the Leica D-Lux3 . At a cost of $ 600 this camera is disappointing . Noise levels above anything but the lowest ISO very prominent the images are quite soft even when shot in RAW and converted with CS2 , which now supports the Leica . The build quality and finish of the camera are very good , but where it counts in image quality , it is no better than many cameras costing much less . I purchased both the Leica and Canon 's latest 10mp Elf-size camera the SD900 and shot the same images with both for about 30 days . The Canon is still here and the Leica has been sold . Sad to see what was once the industry standard for quality bodies and lenses fall to such a low place . I do n't see how leica will survive in the digital world generating such poor quality products . I really wanted to like this camera , but not at any cost ... 	Camera
I was looking to upgrade from a regular point and shoot without getting into a serious DSLR because of size and costs and was looking at the LX3 . Then I saw the LX5 was going to be released soon , so I waited and placed an order on it . This small , but not tiny camera takes great pics especially in low light situations . It could use a little more zoom for outdoor vacation shots , but for almost every situation , this camera takes awesome pics and is small enough to carry everywhere . Only downside is the included software , but most LX5 owners like myself will use other 3rd party software to edit photos . 	Camera
The Minox GTE is a no nonsense high quality photographic machine . It has an excellant 2.8 high speed lens . The camera uses scale focus , this means you estimate the subject distance and set the lens to that distance . It has no range finder . You can set the F stop you desire and the camera will set the shutter speed . You can of course set the shutter speed indirectly buy ajusting the arpeture ring on the lens . The selected shutter speed can be read in the view finder . All curent versions of the camera feature a snap shot index on the lens . Simply line up the green marks on the lens -LRB- f8 and between 10-20ft -RRB- and almost everything records in pretty darn good focus . It has a 2x exposure switch and a self timer . This 35mm camera is so small theres no excuse for not always having it with you . The price is a little high , but it is a German camera with a German lens . On the GTE you set the film speed , this allows for extra exposure compensation control . The camera features a 1\/500 sec . top shutter speed . The only thing I really wished it had was an exposure lock button . This is a great camera for the thinking photographer who can use his or her knowledge to creativly shape there images . 	Camera
i did lots of researching , internet and stores , on most of the novice friendly slrs 's out there . i really wanted the canon rebel xt because it 's the lightest one out there and pretty sharp looking . when i was unwilling to pay the price i took a serious look at the olympus e300 . it 's not as pretty as the rebel but there are still many reasons to love this camera ! i actually like that it looks like the cameras of yester-year ! kind of clunky but has all the great new digital features we 're all yearning for now . i love that it can be completely manual , totally automatic and anywhere in between . i love the fact that you can buy just the body , the body with one lens or the body with 2 lenses . it 's always been a pain even with the 35mm 's that you have to get each component like the filters and flash but we should all be used to that by now ! i 've only owned the camera for a couple of weeks so i have n't yet explored all the possiblities but just tinkering with it i have taken some pretty good shots . it 's a pretty cool camera . ps - batteries , flashes , oem cases can all be checked out at e-bay . i got some pretty good deals on the accessories .

This camera is great . I have used it for dog videos so far and the flyball races were amazing in 1080p . While I recommend the camera it is only fair to mention its two faults . First the original battery is worthless as anything other than a backup I purchased a BP819 and it is great , what should have come on the camera . Second the field of view could be wider , not terrible but depending on your intended use it may be an issue . 	Camera
Finally found a replacement cable for my camera . The problem with this cable was the end that connects to the camera is too bulky to originally fit properly so I had take a knife and widdle down the top corner of the surrounding rubber to make it fit . Still the price makes it worth 4 stars , and it works which is all I care about . 	Camera
As an `` Old School '' 35mm film camera user -- I cut my teeth on a Canon AE1 -- this camera was a great choice for my first , entry-level digital camera . I received it just days before a trip to Disney World . Managed to take hundreds of pictures and all of them are great . One reason I purchased this camera was because it has an viewfinder like my AE1 . I ca n't stand watching people hold their camera 12 inches away from there face and I wo n't do that . This camera is fairly easy to use . I just wish the zoom was manual cause I think I could zoom more the way I can it quicker and better without depending on the mechanics of the camera . 	Camera
The camera worked perfectly for one week and then stopped working permanently . I just sent it off for repairs and have not received a diagnosis as to the root of the problem . 	Camera
The camera is superb . Works better than any other camera that I have used . The infrared feature works great in complete darkness . I have it sending motion alerts to my Iphone . 	Camera
The deal breaker : This camera does not have the ability to turn off the quick view . When I am taking pictures I do n't always want to see each and every photo after each and every shot . That is what the review button is for . I can take several photos and delete what I did not like ! I do n't like the feel of the camera . It is awkward . My hands fold all over the camera and my fingers have to bend in uncomfortable moves just to focus and then to press the shutter button ! It is `` noisy '' . I do n't mean that the neighbors can hear you take a photo but all that grinding noise is annoying ! My P850 does not make even half that noise ! I will say the camera takes some nice outdoor shots ... indoors , no. . I could `` get used '' to this camera in the operation sense but for this much money , I should not have to . My P850 was much heavier yet there was so little awkwardness in the feel that I did not notice the heft . Whereas this camera while lighter is just carpal tunnel waiting to set in ! This camera is going back today ! It is too bad . I really had high hopes for it . I really used to love the Kodak name . It meant quality . It meant value . Now it just means `` cheap '' throw something together ! 	Camera
Excellent product . Have a nice experience with this CAMERA !! From Barranquilla Colombia . I think that wide photos have a little resolution but we can enjoy this article . 	Camera
I purchased this car cable for my iPod to use in my 370Z and it works perfectly . The length of the cable was also perfect as it allows a little more freedom of movement when in larger cars . I highly recommend this as an inexpensive yet worthwhile purchase !!! 	Car Stereo
This is a good cable . I use it with my iPod Nano to connect the Nano to the car stereo . The connectors fit both the Nano and the car jack well and I do n't get any interruptions or interference with the music . The cable does n't come loose and I do n't have to fiddle with it to get the best sound . The fidelity of the music in the car is good . It was n't the cheapest but it is excellent quality and I feel it is good value . You get what you pay for . 	Car Stereo
Smaller than I had expected which is a bonus . Really easy to set-up . After reading the pairing & usage instructions twice , paired it easily with iPhone 4S . I used velcro -LRB- not supplied -RRB- to hold the receiver securely onto the radio panel -LRB- so it wo n't swing back-forth during driving -RRB- . When I get in car & start up car , I just hold the button 3-5 seconds till blue light flashes then enable music -LRB- used Pandora -RRB- on iPhone 4S and I 'm set to drive ! It shuts down automatically after 5 minutes of no Bluetooth connection which is a plus as do n't want to be bothered with it when I park car and leave . 	Car Stereo
This is a review for two products the Pioneer TS SWX251 10 SHALLOW SERIES PRELOADED ENCLOSURE and the Boss Audio R1100M Mosfet Monoblock Power Amplifier $ 60.00 . I purchased these to replace the Infinity Bass Link sub that quit working one month after warranty , like many others who owned one . So I bought this set up . It has been about 30 days , Man , this set up hits hard and tight at any price range . I listen to a wide range of music everything from the Jefferson Airplane to Supertramp to Dream Theater , Spock 's Beard ETC. . On the older stuff a very nice warm bass . When Dream Theater is playing , Portnoy 's kicks pound your butt and chest . If you 're looking for a low cost sub set up , you have found it . The speaker and amp will run about $ 185.00 .

This is my fourth attempt at an aux cable for my car . The others were cheaply made and did n't stay in or wore out quickly . This one is perfect . It is long enough , and durable . There is no problem with it fitting and staying where it belongs and it does n't cut out because of kinks . My daughter uses it as well and her words were , `` Love it ! '' . I would do a commercial for this product . 	Car Stereo
The product i received was in perfect brand new condition it was easy to use very self explanatory also worked perfectly has yet to give me any issues and i use it on a daily basis with many different devices 	Car Stereo

The connectors on this cable are designed to work through the thick case\/protectors on phones\/ipods etc. . The previous cable I used would always come loose from my phone while I was driving and I constantly had to adjust the connection . This works perfectly . 	Car Stereo
I returned this after 5 days , nice looking radio , BUT . . Just read all the negative\/cons of other reviewers . They are all so true . . Pioneer App radio , far from the reality of being ready for every car dash boards . 	Car Stereo
The sound quality is great . Its a well constructed cable . However , the head of the cable is too fat . I have to take my iphone case off in order for the cable to make a connection . 	Car Stereo
The Satechi Bluetooth FM Transmitter is an excellent unit for hands-free calling and getting music to your car stereo if you do n't have a line input . Sound quality is very good and the FM Transmitter is the best I 've ever used - and I 've tried many . Only downside is that it does not have an on\/off switch ; so you have to unplug the unit to cut the power if you vehicle does not have a switched power outlet . This is a minor inconvenience . One thing to note is that , when using this unit with an Iphone , be sure to turn off WiFi on your Iphone or you may experience interrupted connectivity . That 's because Bluetooth and WiFi interfere with one another . This may be caused by the shared antenna on the Iphone . Iphones are infamous for problems with Bluetooth . I would recommend the Satechi unit to anyone looking for a good hands-free solution and a way to listen to music in their vehicle . 	Car Stereo
This cable is cheaply made , the sound quality is pretty terrible , and it does n't have a good connection . It 's constantly in and out and I have to turn it a few times to find a good spot . Also the ends are too big to fit into most cell phone covers . 	Car Stereo
So far My first Aux cable is good without any tangles with the cable . Length is not too long or too short . 	Car Stereo
my plug is in the glove compartment and in spite of that , this little device does the job . it is not for making phone calls so dont buy it with that in mind . 	Car Stereo
After checking the various options for a wiring kit for the Pioneer AppRadio 2 I chose this one . I installed the unit in a VW Jetta and the hardest part of the installation was modifying the interior dash to make room for the additional wires and housings . The original `` Monsoon '' radio was a tight fit and there was no room without cutting out some of the plastic housing . This harness made the installation very easy . I also purchased the steering wheel control kit and I am pleased with the results . It was truly `` plug and play '' . The unit sensed the installation and configured itself to the Jetta steering wheel controls . If I was to do this again , I ca n't imagine a better kit for the project . 	Car Stereo
This product is great , it 's super hard to find a FM Transmitter that will do A2DP . I love it . I can stream shoutcast streams to my stereo via my cell phone and listen to stuff that would never be played on terrestrial radio . The hands-free does n't work great . It 's usable but people complain that the can hear echoing . I bought this for the A2DP so I 'm not bummed about the lack luster hands-free performance . I have no complaints about the A2DP functionality , it works perfectly ! 	Car Stereo
I am frugal but in this case spend the $ $ $ and by the either XM tuner from XM brand or go wit Serrius as XM service is veryyyyyyyyyyy poor 	Car Stereo
After I received the GSI sound blaster I found it Simple to use even though the input jacks are not labeled , placement was not hard to figure out . This device has improved the sound quality of my music through my pc desk top speakers , more punch , and crisp clear highs . Over all a good product that works as described , glad I bought it , a good buy . 	Car Stereo
I liked the idea of this product , and it worked pretty well -- for a week . It literally came apart in my hand when I tried to pull the unit from my DC power outlet -LRB- VW Jetta , not a tricky location -RRB- . The plastic casing is pretty easy to pull apart , the red wire pulled off the circuit board . I 'm not a big guy and there was no abuse , just a simple pull and a surprise . I called Satechi 's customer service line , a very nice woman instructed me to send an email to `` Sales '' and give my order info and a brief explanation of what happened . I did . Nothing . This was months ago . So , a great idea but cheesy construction and a disconnect in service . I bought a newer edition Transdock for iphone instead and dropped back to my bluetooth headset . : -LRB- 	Car Stereo
I have a 2007 Acura that I have had for 3 years and never used the AUX input jack that is located in the console . I got a new 16 Gig iPod nano for my birthday , which holds ALOT more songs , so I was hoping to stop carrying around so many CD 's and using the ipod instead . I found this cable which was reasonably priced and the free shipping was a bonus !! When I first plugged it in and played the ipod , the sound quality SUCKED and I had to turn the volume waaay up and there was no bass or richness to the music at all , hard to describe . But then I tightened the connection at the AUX input by twisting the cable and it 's worked fine ever since . I recommend you turn the volume of your ipod up almost all the way and then adjust the volume from your car stereo 's volume control for the best sound : - -RRB- Would definitely recommend this product !

The item is good quality . It was packaged properly and arrived quickly . I was very pleased with the shipment and would order again from this company . Highly recommend their product , works like a charm . Very pleased . 	Car Stereo
I have a receiver in an upstairs loft that is totally open to the living area below . The speakers are in the ceiling and sound great but I do not want to go upstairs to change volume or what is currently playing . I purchased the britelink bluetooh audio receiver in order to control the audio from below . The device worked great for about three weeks , but now it is the Christmas season and I ca n't play my Christmas music . The signal became very weak and cuts out about every three seconds . I have written to the manufacturer and at this point have not received any word as to wheter the device will be replaced or if there is any troubleshooting that can be done to correct the problem . I would not purchase this device again if given the chance . 	Car Stereo
I had a olympus that stopped connecting to my computer via USB , plus it only recorded in Windows Media Player format -- making it difficult to find an editor that would work with the files . Major bummer . So , I decided that I wanted something that would record in MP3 , and with an SD card slot . This player fits the bill , plus it records in . wav format . Records stereo or mono at the flip of a switch , has many different bit rates at which it can record -LRB- I always use the highest , but space is n't an issue for me -RRB- . The screen is nice , the menus are intuitive . I only just got it and started using it today , so I ca n't speak to longevity , but for now I 'm giving it five stars . 	Car Stereo
very good quality product ! make sure you turn up the volume on your ipod before trying it out . Produces good sound quality for such a low price - highly recommended ! 	Car Stereo
I had done much research on head units before I went and purchased one . I liked this particular one because it was simple looking and seemed very straight forward . When I installed it and started using it , it completely fulfilled my expectations . It sounds amazing for a 80 dollar head unit . My friend has a 2011 tundra with a 1000 dollar aftermarket head unit and my 05 trailblazer sound system sounds just as good as his . I was shocked . It is pretty simple to use ... and I love that it has a remote with it , its very handy . Overall I would recommend this to anyone . Amazing head unit for an extremely affordable budget .

Use this with my Sansa clip in my car . Pretty durable , have accidentally caught stuff on the end of the cord and it did not break . Kinda short though , but for my needs -LRB- put the clip right under the radio in a small compartment -RRB- it 's great . Only complaint is it kinda sticks out , causing the aforementioned problem . But would definitely recommend ! 	Car Stereo
These are the best aux cables I have had yet . Work perfectly without any interference . The only small gripe that I have is that the rubber casing around the head is a little too large making it harder to insert when the phone has a protective casing on . Other than that great item , it even arrived one day earlier than promised . 	Car Stereo

I previously was using a wired fm transmitter and it was a total waste of money . This Satechi Bluetooth device is AWESOME !! So easy to set up and it works great . I use both the handsfree calling feature as well as playing mp3 files - it automatically switches over to the phone when playing music , pausing the music , and then resuming when my call is finished . Ca n't recommend it more highly 	Car Stereo
I bought this cable to use with my ipod shuffle in a 2008 Chevy Malibu . It works great and sounds great . 	Car Stereo
I was wanting a device to listen the Audible Kindle books in my car while traveling and for $ 8.25 I thought that I would try this ... It 's great !! You have to be sure to turn the volume up on your Kindle completely and then you can control the volume through your car radio . Even when on the interstate , the volume is nice and loud . The only problem with this vs. a cd or taped audiobook is that you have to control the buttons on your Kindle . Because of that , for safety , you need to start it and then not mess with it while you are driving . It is great for another Audible option though and the price is certainly right . The reason that I only gave the durability 4 stars is that I have only had this for about 3 weeks and I have no clue how long it will last . Sound quality and ease of use are excellent though ... plug it in and go !! 	Car Stereo
small and works . Wow . The battery power is awsome to use with a battery powered boombox aux input . I get great sound , only complaint is how tiny the font is in the manual . 	Car Stereo
The radio tuner is poor compared to the original radio on my '99 Honda Passport . I live in a major metropolitan area and radio signals are very good . One of the reason that I purchase this was for its ability to control pandora streaming music from the head unit . The software is buggy and the controls on the head unit failed to control pandora on my iPhone 4S . 	Car Stereo
Got this stereo for an older vehicle that I own and will be selling soon . Suits my needs , without the useless CD player . My only complaint is that the equalizer controls are buried in the settings menu when they should instead be quickly accessible . 	Car Stereo
I usually do not write reviews Unless I feel I need to add something to the reviews . I bought this device with the advertised holder and it 's a good combination . -LRB- Satechi SCR-31 Car Holder & Mount for iPhone 3G & 3Gs on Windshi ... -RRB- Shipping and handling was excellent no complaints there . Easy to setup you do n't even need the directions . Just watch the video at the Satechi website . Now on to the actual mechanism . The wireless Bluetooth is great . After synchronzing and a few test runs I now turn on my ipod part of my iphone right before I step into my car and when I start my engine the two connect immediately . Easy enough and since I use a Navigation tool this is downright cool , to have directions over the speakers . Only one issue , I am not sure if the reception on the other end is all that it can be . I called my girlfriend who was at home at the time and I in driveway to see how well the reception was . She said that I sounded like I was in a tunnel but to me in the car she was clear as day . In addition she has a different carrier than I do . I called my sister in DC and she said I sounded okay but just a tad different but good and we have same wireless carrier . So if folks on the other end do n't mind a bit of static or tunnel sound then the device works great ! I give it 4 stars . 	Car Stereo
I have had no problems with the little unit . I am using it on a motorcycle and it has lived up to my needs 	Car Stereo
Great bang for the buck . I am very happy with the size and quality of this unit . Thank you much . The quality was excellent 	Car Stereo
There were no reviews on this unit prior to me ordering it , so I had to take a chance . There are several problems with this unit : \* For starters , the touchscreen is slow to respond , and sometimes does not respond at all . \* The volume knob has a very annoying delay , so it takes several tries to get the volume level to where you want it . \* The GPS MAP can not be updated , several calls emails to the manufacturer yielded no results . \* The screen is very hard to see unless you 're sitting directly in front of the unit , which is never the case in a typical dash mounted radio , you obviously can not mount it on the steering wheel or on top of the dash in front of you . \* I placed the unit in the place where the factory unit went , in the middle of the dash about 6 inches below where the steering column meets the dash , so the head unit is a bit low in the dash . At this height and at this angle , the screen is impossible to see clearly without laying down on the passenger seat ; not very practical while driving . \* The sound quality when listening to regular FM radio is very poor , unit has NO BASE . The stock 15 year old Delco had better sound quality and richness than this one . So for my car , I will be shopping for another unit , one that the screen tilts at several preset angles . I guess you get what you pay for ; Now I know I 'll be spending at least $ 100 more for a decent unit . This unit is not worth the aggravation and wasted installation\/repacking\/return time .

This is the 2nd cable I have brought and they both work perfect . The first one was purchased for use overseas and worked so good . I bought one for home use . 	Car Stereo
I have went through so many FM transmitters in the past year , it 's almost a joke . I did not want to change my factory radio in my Hummer H2 . I think it was decent as is , and do n't care for the fancy nonsense of NAVI systems , or touch screen blah blah . But the one big flaw I 've been having is that it did not come with an AUX cord . So for the past year I have been trying to find a decent FM transmitter to play my iPods , iPhones , through and yet to have found one that lives up to par . I 've tried your Belkin 's , your Griffin 's , etc. . . none work great , and most of the time their horrible . I thought at one point , maybe it 's just my antenna , even though I receive other radio stations very nicely . So this Satechi transmitter was my last straw , if this did n't work , then I gave up . After all umpteenth time of buying these darn things , this would be it . Well , the wait has been worth it . Granted I 've only had this thing for two days , and I will update in a few months , but so far this thing has been awesome . I 've tried in my wife 's beetle bug , and my Hummer H2 , and it works great no matter where it is . For Houstonians , since I live in Houston , I have it paired with station 89.1 FM , and it has been great no matter what part of town I 'm in . I 'll break it down : Seller \/ Shipping : I chose the expedited shipping since I was tired of these FM transmitters and wanted it to come in fast and see if I was done and time to give up . I ordered it on Wednesday , it came in Friday . Seller kept me up to speed on what was going on , though tracking numbers were slow to come by , they eventually came . Product look : Box that it came in was ok , little flimsy and way too much on the easy side to open . The actual packaging for the product was sleek , and nice design . Opening up and taking the Satechi device out , you got a nice black plastic device , that feels pretty sturdy and can take some time being left in a glove box . The actual face of the device looks decent and ca n't be no longer than a credit card . For GM SUVs and Hummer owners , you 'll have to use one of the two left 12V plugins , if you use the cigarette lighter the shifter bumps into it , and it ca n't fit . They also give you a nice corded AUX plug for direct plug in . Ease of use \/ Sound etc. . : This is pretty straight forward , if your even a novice electronic person , you could figure this out in a second . I 'll walk you through as an iPhone user . Plug in the device , find a decent non-used station , for me it was 89.1 FM , use the up and down arrow on the device to seek that station out and pair it . Turn on your iPhone , go to settings , go to bluetooth , wait till you see `` Carkit '' click on Carkit to pair , enter the PW `` 0000 '' and boom you 're done . Pretty simple . And every time it seems like for me , you plug in the Satechi device , it will remember you 're last station you used , so no having to scroll again . As far as making a call , it does what it says . For anyone that has a big SUV or a Hummer , you know that that far right plug in is pretty far from where the driver is . And I 've made a few calls and the clarity has been great . Some people have complained to me about an echo , but just turning down the stereo a little bit , and the problem is solved . Everyone has told me they hear me clear , and on my end , with a decent station , it is clear to hear them . Now on the music side of things , as far as clarity , it is one of the best I 've heard from an FM transmitter hands down . My only problem is , with playing songs through Bluetooth , the volume is definitely dumbed down . But when you use the AUX cable option to your iPod , in this case , the AUX to my iPod touch , the sound is spot on , loud and clear , and even better then some local stations . So its really a matter of what you prefer , if you want the ease of use , no cords , simple wireless connectivity , but do n't mind losing some volume , then bluetoothing your music should work just fine for you . If you want the better sound clarity option , and do n't ming one wire , then AUX ` ing it out to your iPod or whatever is great . What I do is , I pair the device with my iPhone for talking , but leave my iPod plugged in for music . Summary : In the end , I ca n't speak for this product enough , and would recommend this to anyone . The FM transmitter is spot on , strong signal , reaches out and grabs those empty stations with ease . One of the best I 've found for the price out there . Really is no need to look anymore , this is the way to go . 	Car Stereo
The product did n't fit my Blackberry tour very well . When it was attached there was lots of interference , humming noise , through my car stereo . Ending up buying a cheaper Radio Shack brand that work better and was cheaper . 	Car Stereo
I have cases on both my iPod Classic and iPhone 4S , and with my previous Belkin cable I would have to take the cases off to fit the cable in the headphone jack . Not with this one ! It fits perfectly without having to remove the cases , and it 's just the right length . And , most importantly , the sound quality is excellent ! Definitely would recommend buying . 	Car Stereo
I found this cable to be of a better quality than many more available at higher prices . Sound quality is great and cable seems very durable . 	Car Stereo
I use this with my iPhone 3Gs . Easy to use and set up . The only problem I have is that the microphone is in the lighter plug and sometimes my voice is not clear to those receiving my calls . It seemsusing the microphone on the phone would be better . It may be able to do this , and I have not figured it out , but an off switch with the unit would be nice , rather than having to pull it out of the accessory plug . I had a question , and Customer Service at Satechi was excellent . 	Car Stereo
This auxillary cable works so much better than the kind that coils up . Those are a royal pain because you have to pull on it just to get it where you need it and then half the time you end up pulling it out of the jack . This one is alot less hassle because it 's just the right length you need for use in a car . Connection is secure and sound quality is great . Would highly recommend getting one of these . Do n't waste your money on the other kind . 	Car Stereo
My husband installed this radio in a 1972 Jeep that he is restoring . I had also purchased new speakers for him . I was amazed that it sounded so well . The remote control seemed unnecessary . But we have enjoyed playing with it . This is a great product and we could n't beat the price that we paid at Christmas . 	Car Stereo
This has been one of the coolest stereo 's I have seen for a long time . When I first opened it up I was impressed with the build quality and how small the body of it was . I later realized that it does not mount up to any standard brackets due to its small size and had to modify my factory bracket to get it to sit the way I wanted it to . Another problem with it is the face of it is a lot larger than any car 's standard DIN opening so it either has to stick out a lot or you have to cut things to make it fit . If it sticks out you will most likely have to use the sleeve for mounting which may not be an option for come cars and\/or may require a dash kit . Hooking it up was easy and it sounds great . I bought a 32gb SD card for it but it did not work . I ended up using my old 32gb USB thumb drive instead which works fine . The line in functionality is awesome to have . I do n't have any Apple products so I did n't try the iPod connector . Although this stereo has a lot of great features it also has it 's downfalls . It is buggy , slow , sometimes crashes , and has intermittent issues with bluetooth connectivity . Pros : - Looks great - Lots of great features - Great noise cancellation\/reduction - Automatic volume control is awesome - Bluetooth A2DP streaming works great - Bluetooth network for internet streaming and maps is cool - Easy to update Cons : - Size is not standard - Crashes occasionally - Freezes occasionally -LRB- then needs to be reset -RRB- - Takes a while to start up -LRB- almost a minute after turning the key -RRB- - Slugish UI - Slugish when switching sources - Does not remember previous source after being off - Has intermittent bluetooth connectivity issues - Maps App is pretty useless and is not the full Google Maps app - Main menu\/source items can not be hidden if you do n't use them - Not all SD Cards work -LRB- it somehow makes the file system corrupt -RRB- - No automatic dimmer -LRB- you have to set day\/night mode manually -RRB- - No shuffle folder option for USB drive I would not recommend buying this stereo unless you are ready to pay for or do custom work to your car to get this installed and do n't mind the things listed in the cons section . There are many other stereo 's that offer the same features , are easier to install and have less issues . Parrot is coming out with a new 2Din stereo -LRB- -LRB- ... -RRB- -RRB- with the same features as this one and more which will hopefully be a standard size . In my opinion it would be worth the wait if the new stereo has the cons fixed and is faster and more functional . 	Car Stereo
It works as advertised . It does give a tiny buzz\/hiss sound when it 's plugged into the vehicle 's AUX IN , but it can be countered -LRB- masked -RRB- by turning up the volume when music playing . You can only hear it when there is no sound . 	Car Stereo
This unit also comes with a time machine , but regrettably that does n't work either . Totally flaky , crashes almost every trip , you can not use the internet apps without a 3G stick -LRB- no , your android phone tethered nor a 4G stick works either . And good luck finding a 3G stick nowdays -RRB- , no WiFi capabilities . Simply an embarrassment of a device . I regret my purchase and the weekend I spend installing it . Whats worse is that I get to stare at my $ 350 mistake in my dashboard every time I drive . Constant crashes , bluetooth is flaky , no internet capabilities , poorly designed interface and controls . The sad thing is that the hardware is great , but the software is worse than horrid . Do n't take my word for it though , just check-out their OWN users forum on their own website . -LRB- ... -RRB- 	Car Stereo
I received my cable really fast and they work perfectly in the car with my iPod . The sound is good and the cable is a nice length . Not too long and not too short .

Very easy to use and the length of the cord is perfect for placing it into the cupholder with some length to spare . It 's nice to have the option of listening to my own song collection without bothering with CD 's ! 	Car Stereo
pros : texting -LRB- good , you 'll get used to the buttons , connection between the computer and Blu is good , the built in apps are cool cons : no wi fi no big deal 	Car Stereo
i just want to know if i can get some different speakers like the naxa 4-way 1000 watts if the six-way are out of stock then the four way are the same and the same price could you please get back at me about this problem a.s.a.p 	Car Stereo
This product is well-made and simple . Great for hooking up your iPod or other media device to an external speaker . I use it on my Bose sound system , and it works fantastically ! 	Car Stereo
i purchased this so that I could listen to my IPOD on a 5 a hour car trip to Vegas in my rental car . It worked fine there but got a short in it on the way home and sound was horrible . 	Car Stereo
I purchased these cables to connect my iPhone to my Car speakers using Aux . Input and I am really pleased with the build and quality of these cables . Definitely worth spending few more bucks than buying any ordinary cable . 	Car Stereo
I kept having my mp3 cables break in my car . this is very sturdy . It is a heavier cable , and the sound is great using it . I have bought two of these so far for different vehicles . 	Car Stereo
My previous cables developed an awful intermittent static squawk . Although I have plenty of retail stores around , there was n't much selection for audio cables . After studying reviews , I am so glad I purchased the InCar Cables . The cables are substantial quality and the connections are tight . I can enjoy music and podcasts from my touch in the car again . Price -LRB- including shipping -RRB- was less than anything I shopped in town . Shipment was very fast . I would get these again ! 	Car Stereo
Great product !! Easy to use and sounds great !! Works effortlessly with my IPOD ! Love having it in my car ! The product seems very high quality ! Highly Recommend ! 	Car Stereo
Excellent product . Played like magic right out of the box . Love the design better looking than radio shack . 	Car Stereo
I needed an aux cable that can fit my smartphone with a case and I found this . When I did get the item , it did not disappoint . The cable fit perfectly and the audio quality is great . There is no static noise that I can hear , which is a big improvement from the previous aux cable I owned . I know there are other cheaper aux cables out there , but these are definitely worth the price . If you 're looking for a fantastic aux cable , give this one a try . 	Car Stereo
This car cable is the perfect lenght I was looking for . Not to long that I would have extra cable all over my car but also not to short that I could move my iPod around . The color matches my interior perfect . It is a sold cable and works great . The shipment was fast and easy . And the price was great . I recomend this cable to everyone . 	Car Stereo
Very durable cable for IPOD connection to car . Just plug one end into vehicle AUX input jack and the other end into IPOD ear phone jack . Quick and easy . Cable is long enough that my daughter can control the IPOD from the back seat . Highly recommend . Best purchase ever . 	Car Stereo
At least give me the option to use or not use the `` auto off . '' Not only is it really annoying , but the `` on '' light is blue and impossible to see in the sunlight . If you hold the button too long , it goes into pairing mode or turns off . Also , it does n't always turn off so that hours later in the house while I 'm on the phone using bluetooth headphones , the call keeps dropping out as my phone tries to pair with the BR600 which is still ON in my car . I put up with it for a few days , then returned it . It was just too buggy . 	Car Stereo
I bought this to stream music or GPS voice instructions to my car stereo from my iPad or iPod . It streams music wonderfully well with great sound quality . However I can not rate it 5 stars for the following reasons concerning it 's useability . First if I plug in the charger cable , for some reason , it switches itself off while charging . That means you can only use it for streaming in battery mode . Quite insane in my opinion . Second , it has an activity detector which is fine for streaming music , but when using my GPS , after a little period of silence , this unit mutes and so misses the initial bits of the voice commands when they resume . Extremeley annoying . So to conclude , if you intend to only use this as a portable device and expect not to have to use it while it recharges and only use it to stream music with no long silences or gaps then it 's perfect . For voice commands from your GPS , it 's almost useless . Tom 	Car Stereo
This is exactly what I am looking for , but it is not in stock ? 	Car Stereo
Only one negative I 've found is that the volume level is not as loud with bluetooth music playing as with the radio alone . Phone reception : hearing the person on the other end is very loud . Guess I need an amp to boost the volume when using for music playing . Overall : next best thing to having a radio that has bluetooth or aux capable . I would tell a friend 	Car Stereo
I searched around for something just like this last year and , to my surprise , found this one . I was about to travel cross coutry from the east coast and I wanted something that had the A2DP -LRB- bluetooth stereo -RRB- capability so I could use all the music features etc. that are already on my Blackberry Storm . It worked well producing very good music on my truck stereo . We would be on the road 10-12 hours a day while on the move and the USB power port kept my BB charged up . I had many phone conversations on it w\/o missing a beat also -- that was nice . The first one that I received was acting up but Satechi 's customer support was excellent and they sent me a new one out overnight right away because we were about to leave on the trip . I liked the fact that the signal strength was good enough to be picked up on my RVs radio while camping . People around us at the campground could also tune in and listen . I move it to which ever vehicle I 'm going to be in for any length of time . 	Car Stereo
I purchased these cables so that I would be able to utilize the AUX function of my stereo . The cables work great and have proven to be very sturdy . I have a full family with smartphones , and the amount of use this poor cable has had just in the past week alone proves the quality ! And the extremely fast shipping from the seller was a definite bonus . 	Car Stereo
This is a great product for the price , I would recommend it to anyone looking for a cable . Thank you ! 	Car Stereo
I purchased this cable as a last ditch effort to use my Zune in my car . The first cable I purchased , a different brand , lasted me over a year . The second cable I purchased at a department store lasted a week . My receipt got tossed with the packaging on accident and I was not a happy camper . I use my MP3 player a lot as I 'm a heavy commuter . It 's my main source of music and I need a reliable AUX cable to get me through the journey to and from work every day . Needless to say , having to buy a third cable had my eye twitching . I was paying department store prices -LRB- like a dum-dum -RRB- and I was not looking forward to dishing out more money for a cable . I found this one here for a decent price , half of what department stores want for their products , and it had good reviews . I 'm glad I took the plunge because it 's been a good buy . Quality seems reliable and the plugs are a little large , but not so bulky that they get in the way . I recommend it for the price . 	Car Stereo
I had previously purchased a 2 dollar cheap wire , no where near worth it compared to this one , my old wire cut in and out in the loudness and the casing came loose , this wire is so much louder on my stereo and it sounds so crisp and clean , the durability of this wire should last me a while , i hear everything so clearly and loud ! 	Car Stereo
For the price and free shipping , this mechless unit is a good performer . Not as many features as more expensive units , but makes the unit easier to use . Good punchy sound without an external amp . Easy to install and use once I read the manual . Could be smaller given that it has no CD player - about the same size as a regular unit , but much lighter . There are not a whole lot of mechless units out there and this is a good one . 	Car Stereo
The cable works great . It connects my ipod to my stereo in my Jeep . Great quality and was shipped quickly . 	Car Stereo
More import junk from China , You can get same thing on Ebay listed as `` sports radio '' for $ 10 they are not made for motorcycles but for Bicycles , Dont waste your money you will be disappointed 	Car Stereo
bought two of these as my kids are always using mine and then I can never find it when I need it . works great , in both of our vehicles -LRB- lexus\/toyota -RRB- of which I now leave them in the car ... would definitely buy these again . The price is reasonable , the product is perfect . 	Car Stereo
the only problem i have with this product is the sound quality you have to turn up the sound twice as high as the normal radio stations 	Car Stereo
Everything come through just fine with the 2 I purchased . I use in all my vehicles with my Cell . Music & Voice come through my speakers just like it was Blue Tooth . 	Car Stereo
Though I try to be careful , in a tight space like a vehicle wires can get tugged accidentally . This cord is very ruggedly built and should last a long time . I strongly recommend this cable ! 	Car Stereo
I have tried couple bluetooth FM Transmitters in the past and I can say that Satechi is the best transmitter . Setup was no brainer . I am very happy with the sound quality and the ease of use . The sound quality with incoming call was low and I will have to see if it was the FM frequency problem . One thing about sound is that you have turn up the volume on the phone and the audio system a bit . I have used Pandora , Youtube , other music apps on my iPhone 3GS and I am very happy Satechi so far . 	Car Stereo
This product can not be used for anything other than a paperwieght ... it is total junk ... Not only can you NOT program the device , every computer that I attempted to conect the device to could not install the `` software '' provided via the audiovox web site . . ` windows can not update the software for this `` unknown device '' because the driver already installed is newer that the driver you are trying to install '' Good-by ... Tried to get it to work it at home , at work , at a `` pro-car audio '' shop and at circuit city . . does not work ... Returend it bought the `` XMCommanderMT through the AUX port ... that worked just fine . . 	Car Stereo
They fit perfectly into my iPhone or IPod even w\/my Otterbox and they work great . The only reason I 'm not giving 5 stars is I 've only had them a month or so and ca n't speak for durability . Would definitely recommend though . 	Car Stereo
Item was the best price in town . Installed into a 1973 El Camino , love the fact that no cds are needed and music can be saved on usb . Quality , price and look give the car a upgraded look 	Car Stereo
This cable works just great . I use it in my car to hook up my MP3 player to my car stereo system . Sound reproduction is as good , if not better , than headphones . So , the cable is definitely sending enough signal in sufficient detail and strength from my MP3 player to the MP3 socket in my R32 's glove box . I have two slight gripes . First , the cable is quite thick and makes it difficult to close the glove box door . Consequently , the door surround pinches the cable which I hope wo n't break it over time . Second , the free shipping from InCarCables is great , but you get what you pay for . Flimsy packaging . My cable arrived in a thin plastic envelope . It was absolutely fine , but could so easily have been damaged in transit . Personally , I 'd have been happy to pay a few extra bucks for a padded envelope or a small cardboard box for the packaging . Overall , do n't be fooled into buying massively expensive cables thinking that 's the only way you 're going to get quality sound . This cable works just great . You 'll see ! Or rather hear ! 	Car Stereo
Works well , I bought it for our trip to the beach . I had very little trouble with station interference and there was no static . It played the music well and clear . I had been looking for something I did n't have to have plugged into my iPhone and this fit the bill . 	Car Stereo
I replaced a pair of AUX cables that roll back into the roll , I found that to be a bit annoying , so I wanted a cable that did n't do that . Found these for a great price and they work wonderfully . The over pair must have been more messed up because you could only hear half the sound unless you pulled the port out halfway . With these there is sound everywhere and great quality at that . They seem to be a good durable pair as well ! 	Car Stereo
I have a pair of Peltor Worktunes headphones that the patch cord shorted out after a year of use . I purchased a cable to replace the one that came with the headphones and it shorted out within two weeks . I decided to give this brand a try . It works very well with my radio , mp3 player and the headphones . The cord is a bit long but not overly long for what I use it for . The plugs are a bit large but that may turn out to be a good thing . The sound at first was a little muddled on the bass side but after awhile it went away and now the music sounds great . I am hoping this cable will last a long time . 	Car Stereo
This product is wonderful !! I read through many reviews when looking for an FM Transmitter so that I would be able to listen to my purchased Itunes through my Iphone 4S in my car , and decided on this one . SO HAPPY I DID !! I know there are others that are less expensive but I 'm telling you if you want a solid product , this is it . Sound is as crisp as listening to a CD . Bluetooth works very well too . Pretty much no set up required other than plugging the device into the lighter and your phone into the device . That 's it ! Device scans automatically to find the best station . -LRB- Be sure you car radio is set to the one on the scanner -RRB- I 'm so happy with this I 'm getting another : -RRB- ... for my other car . 	Car Stereo
The cable was absolutely what I needed , no frills , just wanted to hear my ipod in my car stereo and not have to deal with complicated installations , etc. . You just plug these in , change your stereo to `` aux '' and you 're set . Could n't be happier , and the cost was great too . 	Car Stereo
So far I 'm impressed with this gadget . Its small so I have it stored in my armrest where there is an extra cigarette lighter so its out of sight . Setting it up was easy breezy . As for use and clarity , I havent gotten that much road time with it but from the test calls I 've made - I think it sounds pretty good . 	Car Stereo
"This particular wire turned out to be exactly what I needed to connect my <ahref=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002MAPSQM/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/183-1663207-9583126""> SanDisk Sansa Clip + 2 GB MP3 Player -LRB- Black -RRB- </a> to the car stereo through the AUX port . It 's got the following going for it : - Right size - 4 ft. seems to be the ideal size with the MP3 player placed under the dashboard . - Good sound quality . - Not-too-cheap looking connectors . And the grey-black style happens to match my car 's interior . - Price is not too bad . Not exactly cheap for what I got but , given free shipping , it 's tolerable . - There seems to be some customer support from vendor . InCarCables included a postcard with the shipment , offering to replace defective cables and even to ship the right cable upon emailing them if they sent you the wrong one by mistake . Overall , it 's the best value on this length\/quality I found at Amazon at the time I ordered . I was inclined to award it 4 star because the price is a little high but , given the nice customer support commitment , I 'm upgrading my rating to a 5-star . We should always encourage vendors that value their customers and promise to stand behind their product . "	Car Stereo
These cables are great for our new Hyundai Santa Fe . The dealer wanted $ 35 . for them , but we bought this better cable on Amazon for $ 8.99 . What 's up with Hyundai ? 	Car Stereo

This product was highly recommended to me by a local car audio shop . I have been dealing with this shop for years and they do work for high end car dealers and take care of factory warranty problems . The guys in this shop are experts at what they do . I had ordered a hard wired ipod connector for my daughters car -LRB- the only one that was available for her make and model of car and existing stereo , at twice the price of this item -RRB- . I paid to have it installed , and it was a piece of junk . Since there were no other ipod kits available anywhere , as a last resort I stopped in to my local car audio shop to see if there was any other possible solution . The owner of the shop highly recommended this product , and this product alone . He said he has installed these in everything from Mercedes to Hummers to Fords and everyone loves them . The minute I heard `` FM '' I was disappointed , because I had already bought numerous FM \/ Ipod transmitter things that plug into your cigarette liter and never work . The owner of the shop swore that this item was different , and he had never had an unhappy customer . Reluctantly , I ordered one . To say I am absolutely thrilled with this item would be an understatement . When you connect your ipod to this -LRB- hard wired -RRB- cord , ALL FM stations are immediately and completely blocked out , and all you hear is your sweet ipod music , loud and clear ! I was so very happy with this product , I ordered 2 more , so I now have them in all my vehicles . Trust me , I am a perfectionist , and this is the best money I have spent in a long time . I rarely write reviews of products because I am rarely blown away by the quality of stuff , but this deserves a stellar review ! You will not be disappointed ! 	Car Stereo
Product arrived in timely manner and is easy to used but the connection is n't very good if you have an ipod case around the ipod . Can be easily solved by taking the case off but it 's a major inconvenience . 	Car Stereo
Nothing much to be said about this product . I bought it for my new car to listen to my mp3 player instead of burning mp3 CDs . It works just like it should . The cords are n't short nor long . It 's perfect for my car -LRB- my car is a sedan -RRB- . I have n't had a problem with this cable yet . 	Car Stereo

I have had limited luck with plug-in radio transmitters for playing music from my ipod or iphone through my car stereo . Finally , I found this -- the magic device . Music plays beautifully -- no static at all -- you would n't realize that it 's not a CD . Granted , I am not an audiophile , but I do tell a pronounced difference from the last Monster Cable transmitter I had . And on top of everything , it 's bluetooth , so there are no annoying wires AND it does phone calls through the stereo , as well . I have n't made that many calls yet , but so far the sound quality seems great for both parties on the line . I totally recommend this . 	Car Stereo
I 've used both the M170 and M175C headsets extensively with both cordless and cell phones . The 170 is the same except for lacking a listening volume control and mic mute switch on a pod in the middle of the cord . Both headsets are comfortable enough to wear all day -LRB- with headband -RRB- , sound great receiving and good transmitting , and have effective noise-cancelling . The 170 is simpler and does not have the volume\/mute pod swinging around on the cord , and the 175 adds the convenience of these functions . Over a period of years , the volume control can get scratchy , so the 170 lasts longer . The main fault of both headsets is that the mic volume is n't quite loud enough , even with the mic switch on max . I 'm not even sure why there is a mic switch -- it NEVER needs to be turned down . When the other person has trouble hearing me , I unplug the headset and use the phone directly , and the volume increases noticably for them . This is usually not a problem unless the other person is in a noisy environment , but I wish the headset mic would be as loud as the phone mic . Perhaps this is a side-effect of the noise-cancelling mic feature and would require an amplifier to overcome . If I could buy a battery-powered supplemental mic amp , I would . Plantronics , are you listening ? I 'm about to buy another M170 as my old one has died . These headsets have died for me by rough treatment causing damage to the plug or plug wire , or -- on the 175 -- the volume control getting scratchy . Overall , this is a very good headset and the best value I know for the money . 	CellPhone
I have had my Bose MIE2i headphones for over a year now and I would n't dream of replacing them with any others - even after a year they are in excellent shape and have survived lots of abuse in and out of various bags , pockets , etc. . When they do finally wear out I will not hesitate to buy them again . The remote\/mic works with the entire family of Apple products ... iPhone , iPad , iMac , Macbook Air , Shuffle ... seamless ! They sound great , are super comfortable , and stay put even during a vigorous workout . I especially love using these headphones with my iPhone to tell Siri which song to play , who to call , or to ask her what time it is while walking the streets of NY . Hands free . AWESOME !

I got this for my son who is 8 to use with PS3 since a regular bluetooth earpieace wo n't stay on his ear ... this is perfect ! 	CellPhone
\*\*\* Disclaimer \*\*\* I am not a technical genius . I do not understand the words and phrases I read on techie websites . I do not use this phone to its fullest capacity . But , I do know what I like , and I like this phone . \*\*\* End disclaimer \*\*\* This is the best phone I have ever owned . I used to think my last phone , the Blackberry Storm , was the best phone , but after using the Droid X for two weeks I am thoroughly impressed ! I will list a few of my pros and cons . PROS - Google Maps is awesome . I use verbal commands and the phone will give me turn by turn directions , it will type out texts , it will google search for me , and it does it all without having to take my hands off the wheel and start typing in commands . - SWYPE is very cool too . Instead of using my thumbs to type or text , I hold the phone with one hand and use the index finger of my other hand to swype along the screen from letter to letter . It is much faster than typing . I love it . - Camera . The camera is an 8MP digital camera with a lot of options and effects . It takes great pictures . I do not think of it as a `` phone with a camera '' but rather as a `` camera with a phone . '' It also takes some very impressive HD video . And you can email the videos on this phone . My Blackberry Storm took videos , but I could not send them . - Internet . The Internet is way better on this phone than on my Storm . It is like I am surfing on a small computer , not a phone . - Apps . Loading apps could not be easier . How cool is it that you just scan a barcode for the app and the phone takes you right to the download page for that app ? Pretty friggin cool ! CONS - Ringtones . I still do not have this figured out to my liking . This is the one area where the Storm was a lot easier . I could easily set profiles for notifications , set different rings for voice or text , or my favorite , set the phone to phone calls only at night so some random email does not beep in the middle of the night . I have downloaded a few ringtone apps but have not been able to get them set up the way I like yet . I am still working on it . - Holsters . I can not find a holster for this phone that is acceptable . I have been using the `` slide it in my pocket '' mode , but that does not always work out for me . I am pretty active during the day and the phone will sometimes get banged up in my pocket . The market has the plastic clip-in cases that leaves the phone exposed . I have read many reviews on those and it seems the phones sometimes falls out of the clip . That is not acceptable to me . Plus I like the phone to be covered in case I rub against or bump into something . I have come across a few fully enclosed holsters , but they are not something I want to wear on my belt . One was black leather with gold stitching and a huge gold medallion on the side . It looked like a friggin man purse or fannypack . Now I am not normally self-conscious about how I look , but I am not carrying around a man purse or fannypack . I also do a lot of trail running , so the phone would fly out of my pocket , and any holster would have to be secure . To recap , I love this phone . \*\*\* 10\/6 update \*\*\* I found a free app called `` Quick Profile '' in the marketplace and I was able to set up profiles for my rings and notifications . I now have one named `` phone only '' that is basically just my phone , no other notifications at all . Which is great because that is how I always set my blackberry at night . No sleep disturbances for junk emails at night ! And if someone needs to get me in an emergency , they can call me . I was also able to set up a few other profiles for `` office '' which is mainly vibrating and low ringtones , and `` loud '' which is for outdoors , and everything is set to vibrate then loud ringtones and notifications . Now if I can just get the holster thing figured out , life will be perfect , again . 	CellPhone
This product got to me right on time . Shipping was free was well . There was tracking info available as well . This works perfectly with my Samsung Sidekick 4G , the USB was immediately recognized . It is a great product and even better price ! 	CellPhone
Pros : Being able to mount this to my vent instead of my windshield , I love ! It gives a home to my iphone and provides visibility to my phone so I can see incoming calls etc. . Cons : There is no amplifying quality . I was hoping to get away with just using my phone 's speaker for calls in my car but the person on the other end cant here me at all . When I set my iphone in my seat next to me or my lap I do n't have that problem . I want to say it almost makes the sound worse . Overall I love having a place for my phone where I can see it . I do n't think I would have paid $ 30 . for this though if I knew it really did n't amplify . 	CellPhone
Case is super strong , my year and a half old throws the thing around and have not had any issues with it . Strongly recommend this case . 	CellPhone
I get no cell coverage in my home , only out in the driveway . I bought this to extend coverage to at least some of the house as was advertised . Placed the antenna in several locations in the attic as instructed where I got a 2-3 bar signal . Place the receiver unit in several locations as instructed and at time they were 40 ft apart . Got a good signal on my cell phones BUT -LRB- and its a big one -RRB- as soon as I move more than 5 ft from the base unit the signal was lost . I played with this thing for several hours trying different combination 's of vertical and horizontal locations . Always the same result . Conclusion , if you need cell coverage extended to ONE room this works fine or if your willing and lucky enough to keep trying it to find that perfect location combination . I do not think that it is the fault of this product but rather these extender products in general . Their set up is more art than science and you must be prepared to spend a significant amount of time for configuration and still may only get limited results . 	CellPhone
The Nokia N8 , the only thing good about it is the camera , and the HD video capabilities , the use of phone itself , is n't user friendly like the iPhone , over priced , getting a iPhone . And I 'm buy it through Amazon . 	CellPhone
I have n't tried this yet . But it looks good . . came in a cheap packing , maybe because its a OEM and also the fact that how much can you expect for $ 2 . The shipping and handling were more costly than the actual item . Anyway as one of the review said , it is not different from what is shown on the website and I assume it will also work without any problem . . 	CellPhone
This device has been a bit of a disappointment . For starters , the insertion of the Droid into the Docking Station is a bit finicky . I had to learn to rest the Droid against the backrest of the Docking Station during insertion , so as to allow the Droid to mate with the Docking Station smoothly -LRB- the natural tendency is to insert the Droid upright -RRB- . Not a big problem . A bigger problem is that the light is too bright to keep the Docking Station near your bed without dimming it -LRB- to dim it , touch the dimming icon -RRB- , yet while dimmed , the figures on the LCD screen are very difficult , if not impossible , to read because of poor contrast . My clock radio has a much more readable display : red figures against a black background . Placing a piece of red plastic over the \* UNdimmed \* display of the Droid might be a solution . I think Motorola needs to work on the visibility of the dimmed display . 	CellPhone
This phone is everything I wanted in a phone . I have the wifi which I really had no problem connecting to the internet , it also has dual sim card which I really needed and all the other goodies . I like it . The only thing is how and where do I order additional accesories for the phone if I wanted an extra charger or battery . 	CellPhone

Capactive Stylus is working great . Love It !!! CS is the perfect thing for riding in the car or using on an airplane , the benefit of stabalized touch to the screen will stop errors , which means I save time . Hmmm , save time and stop errors ? Yep perfect . Sent those tech savy 30 something kids of mine out of the room to keep the stylus to myself for a few minutes . `` Heck yea , that stylus is way better than just touching , wonder how it would do with my ninja-angry-majong-list-app thing ? '' is all I heard them talking about . Thank You . It would be great if I knew what the string\/cord attached is to be used as\/for . Again , Thank you . 	CellPhone
Very cool idea and overall well executed . But , the cord it included -LRB- one of those cheap data cables I luckily have like 5 of -RRB- must have shorted out the first time I plugged it in . Not sure what happened , but the first time I tried charging my phone the phone turned off , and the cable stopped working altogether . Using a different cable now and seem to have no problems . The product really should come with a manual - as simple as it is , you still have to figure out what the different color charging lights mean etc. . 	CellPhone
Its been 8 months i purchased Nokia 5800 navigation -LRB- new -RRB- . I already have battery issues . battery life is very poor . i am unhappy with this phone . planning to switch to iphone or andriod . 	CellPhone
My old phone stopped working and did n't want to commit for another two years with the phone company just to get a new phone free -LRB- like there 's anything free anyone really gives any time !! -RRB- Other than the cool slider feature , the phone had everything I needed - lightweight and small enough to carry in a shirt pocket , GSM compatibility , QWERTY keyboard , camera , one button `` lock phone '' , and above all it was also unlocked , so I could simply switch my SIM card from the previous phone and I was ready to roll . Even after I switchover the plan to another carrier -LRB- that supports GSM phones -RRB- I would still be able to keep this as my back up phone . I am sure at least someone 's phone in the family will stop working within two years and instead of paying 5 dollars a month for `` phone insurance '' , having bought this 90 dollar phone will also give me a lot better `` coverage '' should any of the phones stop working during the two year period .

This is a great phone . Camera , music , text and chat . Love it . Works in the USA & the overseas . What else could I ask for . 	CellPhone
I bought this for my husband for Father 's Day . It was a great gift . He is n't very techno savy , but he paired his phone with this right away and was using it right out of the box . Not a usual happening . Sound quality seems fine to me . We tested it right away with incoming and outgoing calls . The sound quality on both ends was good . This handsfree set does n't sound as echoing as other handsfree sets that we have had . The music we played sounded pretty good too . I think I am going to get one for myself . 	CellPhone
Fits great . The lower right corner of the case gets a little loose sometimes , however , overall the case is nice . Looks and feels like its not even there . Recommended . 	CellPhone
I bought this case for GF 's EVO since mid Dec 2010 . It was a perfectly snug fit from day 1 and even now . We 've only had to remove the case twice to access the memory card . The EVO dropped out of GF 's jacket pocket today and hit the concrete with one of the corners , bounced and settled on the camera side . The EVO and camera are still working as normal ! There 's not even a scratch on the phone . The case has scuff marks mostly on the corner . We consider this case to a the best , least expensive and hassle-free insurance we could buy for this phone . 	CellPhone
Well , I bought these thinking they were the kind that come in the package with my iPod originally . Not so . These are cheap hard plastic earbuds . The sound quality is terrible . They hurt my ears when I put them in . I would absolutely NOT recommend these earbuds to ANYONE . Spend a little more money on something that you will use . 	CellPhone
This case is meant to protect the back glass and sides from scratching . It does a great job for doing so . The only problem is the case itself gets really bad after a month of usage . i.e. scratches . For the price I paid , it was worth it . I received the device after a month of my order . 	CellPhone
I purchased these over a year ago and here I am about to order a second pair . These things are rock solid and have been through hell . -LRB- They live in my purse or backpack . -RRB- They have been paired with my iPhone -LRB- all three iterations -RRB- and two different desktops - all with out major incident . Some interference in a couple of buildings I used to work in would cause the occasional minor connection issue , but nothing major . The sound is quite solid . Nothing uber fantastic , but seeing as how I purchased these mostly for listening to audiobooks and I do n't like a lot of bass in my music , that suits me just fine . Charge time is speedy , and any micro-usb cable -LRB- connected to a standard USB port -RRB- will charge the headphones . 	CellPhone
The Micro SIM adapter worked perfectly in the Apple 3GS iPhone . I was able to use the Micro SIM Card from my iPhone 4 in the iPhone 3GS to test Straightalk . Great value and speedy delivery . 	CellPhone
I bought these for my kids ipods and they really work well . Great back-up for long days out or car trips ! 	CellPhone
I have always kept these things on my phone because in the invent that i drop the phone the glass wont break as easily . 	CellPhone
I purchased this portable Bluetooth speaker kit after reading many positive reviews online . For the most part , this is a high quality product that works very well when it decides to pair fully with my Verizon LG VX8700 . Occasionally though , the voice commands do n't function through the Parrot 's call buttons , which you 're supposed to press once then speak . Most of the time I have to activate the voice commands through the phone , which effectively negates the benefits of leaving the phone in my pocket while driving . Also , when dialing a number or during a conversation , the signal cuts in and out , resulting in a choppy sound . I often find myself asking the person on the other line to repeat themselves . But do n't be discouraged , as I still think my issues are related to my phone , and not the kit itself . Nevertheless , I 'm strongly thinking about returning it to Amazon if I ca n't get it to work closer to 100 % of the time . 	CellPhone
Two credit card slots on the case portion touching the phone are a bit tight and hard to get cards in and out of . Have to shove 3-4 credit cards inside to stretch out the leather , but the more you put in those credit card slots will also squeeze the casing around the phone which gives it a weird bulging look -LRB- minor -RRB- . The phone fit a little too snug , hard to type the letter Q , but more important is the number 1 , it can be a struggle . Using the camera is awkward with the magnetic flip strap , just tuck it into\/behind a credit card on the back sleeve , but still awkward holding the phone as a camera with the other half of the case just dangling there . Would be nice if it was detachable . Overall , for what I paid , I 'm satisfied . 	CellPhone
This is my dad 's previously owned phone . He upgraded to an i-Phone because of all the frustration ! I was handed down this phone and I am writing the review . This phone is absolutely crappy ! The quad-band is the only thing that is good about it -LRB- we used it internationally -RRB- . This phone 's keypad is horrible . I can not press a single button without pressing five other buttons . The reception on this phone is mediocre and the battery life is poor . Overall crappy product . 	CellPhone
3 fronts , 3 backs for the iphone 4 's , great product , works well , worth the price , installs quickly . The free installation videos are ingenious ! 	CellPhone
This product is a Samsung replacement , so it works 100 % . No drivers needed on the PC since this is the official data cable . 	CellPhone
These phones , sound every bit as good as my more expensive Logitech Free pulse phones . For my use , they are comfortable and fit snug , as well as look great wearing them . After getting used to where all the controls are , I am one with these phones . Battery life is great to , I must say though I have no need to wear headphones for six hours at any one given time anyway . For this price these are a winner . 	CellPhone
I bought my phone used and paid more -LRB- and had to buy the battery and charger -RRB- so this deal -LRB- included battery & charger -RRB- was great . Ive had my phone 2 years and its still good . My son lives in the hills so is having some reception problems but his area is difficult anyway . this is a great phone for most people and a wonderful deal from the seller I bought from . 	CellPhone
my first amazon review . headphones have really good quality and work very well . i am using it with my iphone and ipad . would recommend them if you want to get untethered . my callers tell me the audio quality of my voice is fine . i wish the button were easier to find and have more of a tactile feel , but other than that , it is a great buy and a great price . 	CellPhone
If you 're tired of babying the battery on your EVO look no further , this extended version is what you are looking for ! I used to have trouble making it through just one day with the standard battery , and that was using all of the tricks -LRB- app killer , background data off , etc -RRB- I could dream up . With this battery I easily get 24 + hours of fairly heavy use before even thinking of recharging . I was slightly worried about the added bulk\/weight , so I purchased the Seidio holster for a `` non-cased '' EVO which holds the phone with the new larger back cover only -LRB- no add-on like the Innocase I had with the standard battery -RRB- . I find the weight and feel in that configuration to be very comfortable . Recommend highly ! 	CellPhone
hello , I could help get the number of shipments and the company because I have not received the phone , thanks 	CellPhone
I really liked this case at first . It fit really well , did n't add too much bulk , and seemed to offer good protection . Then I dropped it from a height of about 3 feet . It protected my phone well no doubt however the skeleton on the top right corner broke off ! Oh well I thought , no big deal . Then a couple months later the same thing happened to the other corner . Seems like the skeleton material is kind of brittle . It would be perfect if it were a little more resilient to breaking off . Another con is that it does n't fit into any type of holster that I know of . Seidio makes good products no doubt but this one is not one of their best . A better alternative to this in my opinion is this the Seidio SURFACE Case and Holster Combo for HTC EVO 4G -LRB- Black -RRB- . Read my review about that one here : -LRB- ... -RRB- 	CellPhone
This cable is really thin and the plug does n't fit securely in the motorolla droid phone . I bought 3 cables -LRB- home , car , work -RRB- , and tried it on my phone , and two friend 's phones , but it 's loose on all of them . Worse yet , it connects , then disconnects , and connects again , and disconnects . On off on off on off on off until your battery is dead . On the RARE occasion it works , if you do n't touch it at all it slowly charges and syncs , but I have n't figured out how to make it work reliably at all . JUNK ! JUNK ! JUNK ! JUNK ! 	CellPhone
A wonderful deal in TracFone minutes ! Even better when used on a Triple Minutes for Life phone . Thanks for the discounts ! 	CellPhone
Based on the reviews here , I decided to order this case since I loved the color . I could n't believe how cheap and flimsy this case is ! I am angry that I spent $ 11 for something that is n't even worth $ 1 ! I have bought cases on the street for $ 5 that included front and back covers for the phone and they are a hell of alot sturdier than this garbage . Are we paying for a fancy name ?! 	CellPhone
This protector applies easily and feels great to touch . Awesome product for the price ! Only complaint is that the corners dont re-stick very well after having to peel it back to get some dust . 	CellPhone
A previous user stated that there is a $ 250 `` porting '' fee , and in effect , there is . If you order from AMZN , you DO save the phone cost BUT since it comes to you `` hot '' -LRB- that is with a pre-assigned Cingular number -RRB- , when you go to port and change that number , Cingular will charge AMZN , who in turn , will bill you for $ 250 . `` New '' to AMZN has what seems to be a very narrow definition , they mean -LRB- apparently -RRB- `` new '' to cell phones -LRB- unlikely -RRB- . 3 stars for AMZN not being as forthright as one might hope 	CellPhone
Purchased Sept 05 to utilize new cars bluetooth capabilities . Works great in my car as well as wifes . I recommend using `` Active Standby '' mode to simplify navigating to the phones many features . It allows the user to assign 5 shortcuts with icons and assign two more to right and left soft keys . Additionally , calendar and `` To Do '' notes are shown and become 2 more direct shortcuts to those apps . These 9 shortcuts are all shown on the main `` Standby '' screen which also displays the current track name -LRB- a 10th shortcut -RRB- when playing audio . Pressing the `` end '' button will always return you to the `` Standby '' screen . All contacts and nearly all applications may be given voice tags to further eliminate keystrokes . I did not purchase the optional voice recognition software but use the voice tags instead . The camera is activated when you slide open the very neat cover even if you have locked the keypad . I have upgraded to a 512M card which gives me enough room for a couple of CD 's worth of music and still have space for pictures . Images can actually be pretty good if the lighting is right . One review here stated that the call log was difficult to access ... not true . Depressing the `` send '' button momentarily will bring it up and you just scoll left\/right to see missed , dialed and received logs . Also holding down the blue `` Menu '' button will show what apps are currently running and allow the user to quickly select one to display . The `` C '' -LRB- clear -RRB- button also acts as a delete which can reduce scrolling in the pop up menus . Another shortcut is to use the \* -LRB- star -RRB- key when viewing the calendar to toggle month , week and day views . The keypad is used often to do things like rotate and zoom images and directly select folders . The Office and Adobe software is great for viewing certain files . I have not done any real editing of docs so I wo n't comment on that . I have done some image editing with the included software and found that fun and easy to use but I do quite a bit of that in my work and so there was not much of a learning curve for me . Those capabilities are somewhat limited but I was impressed because it is a phone . It may not appear so , but is rugged ... I have dropped in onto concrete at least 5 or 6 times and it still shows very little wear and has always functioned reliably . The screen has no scratches at all . Emailing feature is great and works fast on my Cingular network . Speaker works very well for calls . Sounds like my old transister radio from the 60 's for music but works . Placing speaker against an object can cut down on the treble and improve the sound some but headphones are better . Many have complained about the keypad being too small . I find the close spacing and smooth flat tops with angled side to be very efficient and easy to use . I only use my thumb and the close spacing means there is little travel and I can enter text and numbers quickly but I am not writing a book . To obtain a number instead of a letter when in text mode , simply hold the key instead of tapping 4 times . The Symbian OS allow users to add additional software to enhance and customize functionality making this much more than a phone . Battery life has been pretty good and depends on the amount of use . There is an audible indicator which sounds to alert me when it is low so it is seldom an issue . I have a car charger as well as a USB charger at my PC . The round navigation button requires care when wanting to press the center position . It is too easy to miss and inadvertantly get the up or down position instead . I wish there was a dedicated button on the phone for music which could be accessed so I would not have to remove it from my belt . I also wish it used standard connectors as the plug for headphone and PC is somewhat of a pain to use . Cingular had some software issues when this phone was first released last year and withdrew it for a while . They fixed the bugs and have had a few enhancments as well and it has since worked great for me . There may be some newer phones coming which may have some enhanced features which my 6682 lacks but it has proven to be a tough and reliable performer and will be difficult to replace . 	CellPhone
it is really perfect phone , i liked blackberry storm2 , it works perfect , it came with extra accessories , i am going to buy one more for my sister 	CellPhone
simply it is the device for the business person . a cell phone designed with business use in mind . also a touch of fun is there 	CellPhone
I managed to get three dust pieces under it despite having cleaned the area obsessively before applying it , as instructed . And for some reason , it did not stick to the bottom of my screen , up till about the bottom of the buttons , and it separates at the side of the phone a little as well . I did not bother to replace or re-apply but it is definitely not good enough . 	CellPhone
what can i say ? this is a great little phone , that does everything i need it to do . im not to fond of the Vcast sync but you cant have everything . 	CellPhone
"I 've been looking for a way to listen to the TV 's at the gym without wires , now I have it . The JayBird uSport worked perfect right out of the box . I charged it , paired it to my Jabra Sport bluetooth headphones <ahref=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005FVNHBI/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/186-4005498-4226310""> Jabra SPORT Bluetooth Stereo Headset - Black\/Yellow </a> , and went to the gym . The sound is so fast that you can bairly see the lag when watching someones lips move and hearing their voice . I would say the only two drawbacks are the specialized USB cable for charging and it can only be paired with one headset at a time . The pairing was simple so the only thing I would be worried about is losing the USB charging cable . Otherwise it is a great product . "	CellPhone
For extensive business travel where I want ONE headset to support both my music and soft phone needs in a small form factor , the S10-HD is works very well and has a long battery life . The S10 is also surprisingly comfortable . 	CellPhone
Bought the S10-HD from Amazon , almost half the price of what it was at Best Buy . Used it now for two weeks and I really enjoy it . I paired it using the bluetooth with my MOTOACTV watch and it works great . No problem making the connection and the sound quality from my perspective is fine . I use it while running , 4 or 5 miles per day . Absolutely no problems with it , my only complaint is that the User 's Manual was in such small print that I could hardly read it . Ended up downloading a copy from Motorola in case I ever need it . My only concern is I sure hope it is sweat proof . I run in Texas and running in August in Texas is brutal , just hope it holds up to heavy duty perspiration . In summary , great device , easy to set up , good battery life , and it provides a good sound . One of the best purchases I have made in a while . 	CellPhone
JUNE 15 2010 UPDATE : BEWARE !!! After 2 months of use the cradle NO LONGER CHARGES THE PHONE !! I was so excited about this item but I quickly realized that Seidio must have rushed through quality and control on this item since others are having the same problem . Seidio needs to redesign and fix this problem ! I would not buy this car kit if I were you ! Initial Review in March of 2010 : Yes , this car kit is very good . You can use it with or without a Seidio case . There is an extra piece in the box to use if your Droid is not protected by a Seidio case . Either way , this is a nice car kit for the Motorola Droid but 50 dollars is alot for it . I think 30 dollars is too much for this kit but I guess when there is n't anything else available , the company can charge what they want . The kit easily attached to my windshield and does not move around . There is plenty of AC cord to go from the AC plug to the car cradle . My AC plug is located in the center console of my Camry so there is enough cord length to reach the cradle which I placed on the windshield to left side of the steering wheel . Actually there is alot of cord left over so do n't worry that you wo n't have enough cord to make this setup work in your car . The cradle can mount in any direction and is easily adjustable even when securely attached to the windshield . Being able to easily adjust the cradle while it is attached to the windshield is a bonus , especially when the sun comes into play while driving . I would not hesitate to purchase this car kit although I firmly feel the price should be lower . 	CellPhone
It 's one of the best phones made by Nokia In my experience with nokia cellphones , my old model was an N96 , compared to it it , Symbian ^ 3 has amazingly improved it speed of response , the best is the free for life A-GPS , ovi store for downloading tons of apps , it has a great quality 12MP combined with geotagging camera and its 720p recording video feature is amazing . Finally nokia made an integrated app for facebook users which allows to post , comment and upload photos , it 's not the best , compared to iphone or ipod , but they 're on going on the right way , still there are many things that can be improved about this app . Another great feature is the integrated radio live streaming for listening your music in N8 directly on your radio . I love the design and the shiny AMOLED screen . 	CellPhone
These screens are n't even cut to the proper size of the EVO . I wasted all three to figure it out . I guess this is what I needed to be assured that if I want the phone protected , to take it to a professional . 	CellPhone
These are the worst cables I have ever bought , even worse than the cheap eBay cables . I bought 10 cables and all are pretty much worthless , they give the `` this accessory is not supported '' error on all devices . Sometimes I get lucky and it does n't give the message but it takes forever to charge . Several of the cables ends are already pulling loose and wires are starting to show from under the housings . 	CellPhone
This cover is very solid . It fits perfectly and the color is rich ! It makes my phone look great . I would love to buy one in purple ! My husband recommended this brand as he had great luck with one of these covers as well . You wo n't go wrong ordering one of these iFrogz . I received my shipment very quickly . 	CellPhone
The Android platform is a fantastic alternative to the iPhone . Especially when loaded on a device with this screen size and hardware specs . The Droid X is a pleasure to use . The screen is large enough that typing on the touch screen is not a problem , you also do not have to scroll as much when reading emails . The Gmail client is fantastic as you can go back as far as you want in your labels so you can search your entire mailbox . There is the Android Marketplace for apps and Amazon MP3 is preloaded so you can purchase music directly from the phone . It has a full web browser with Flash support , it of course runs on the Verizon network so if you know it is good where you live then it will be good on this phone . Really I would say this phone has one huge weakness and that is battery life . At best I can get 1 day out of the phone and it is back on charge at night . Most days I usually charge it in the afternoon to give it a boost to make it the rest of the evening . But given the fact that you are pretty much running a computer in your hand that is a small price to pay . If you are in the market for a smart phone I would high suggest the Droid X or the HTC EVO . 	CellPhone
Seems like a great charger for any micro USB device , like my new Novatel MiFi 2372 -LRB- portable wifi hub -RRB- and my daughter 's LG GW370 cell phone . Small , light and narrow for packing or fitting in crowded 12 volt spots . Easy to remove . -LRB- In contrast , I bought a tiny belkin power charger for an iphone \/ ipad that is nearly impossible to remove from 12 volt outlets , as it is flat and does not protrude at all ! -RRB- 	CellPhone
My daughter bought this product so that her phone would stay charged , however , the charger case does n't work . When we plug it in it does n't charge . The only way to get it to charge is to sit and hold the charger at a certain angle . It wo n't stay at that angle so if you are not holding it it wo n't charge . I wish I knew who to contact to return it to them and get my money back . 	CellPhone
This is a great case . Fits like a glove and cheaper than otterbox . I would recommend to anyone on a needing protection at a great rate . Oh , the case did not add any bulk either ! 	CellPhone
I got this bluetooth headset last month . It 's really wonderful . Voice interface is really easy to use . Design is perfectly fit to my ear and really comfortable . sound is also great . but the battery life is too short . just one to two hours . . 	CellPhone
just got these iPhone chargers they are terrible they only charged the iPhone 10 percent , i want my money back ! 	CellPhone
First the good : The clarity is good , reception is good -LRB- I can hear fine and the other person hears okay -RRB- , and the feature set is great -LRB- I 've even used the stopwatch once or twice to time reactions in chem lab -RRB- . Like most cell phones , the phone is sturdy , I 've dropped it a number of times and still works fine . Now the bad : I would agree with several other reviewers who complained that their phone turns off randomly ; mine does as well occasionally . My biggest grievance with this phone is that there is too many alerts and everything requires too many button presses ! For example : I 'll be playing Tetris and I 'll pause and minimize the game to send a message . Then , every time I do anything after that - place a call , send a message , anytime I even open the phone - a message pops up : `` Tetris is running '' ; I have to hit okay . Then only two options : `` Maximize '' or `` Stop '' Well , neither ! I want the game minimized ! So , I hold down the back button until it goes away . Then another alert : `` Tetris - Exit appliation ? '' I hit NO ! So , just to do anything , that 's a long series of buttons ! It 's cool that I can minimize a java program in a middle of a game . It 's NOT cool that it tries to force it 's way back open ! I want to minimize something until I 'm ready to open it back up again . The phone should do what I want it to , not the other way around . This theme of `` button overburdening '' carries over throughout all areas of the phone . To add a second recipient to a message takes a series of five buttons , not counting scrolling to the name . To delete a recipient takes another 5 . Just to switch between text and numerical typing takes holding down the # button followed by a series of 4 button presses ! Also , the email will randomly pop up to ask if you want to check email . The email functionality of this phone is great , when I want to use it . I do n't like getting random pop-ups that force me to accidentally click okay and something happens when I was in the middle of something else . All of these things can be very annoying when you 're just trying to send a quick message or place a quick call . Summary : I like the phone and I like the feature set . However , the execution of the feature set is not well thought-out . The functionality of some of the `` features '' of the phone was poorly implemented , clumsy , and at times annoying and frustrating to use . I would give the phone 4 stars if it were n't for these inconveniences of the phone that could probably be fixed by a firmware update . 	CellPhone
No fancy package because it 's a non OEM , but you just throw that out anyway , still has the protective plastic case . No need to format or anything with my LG enV . Popped it in and it worked fine . 	CellPhone
As the title says : It came a couple days too late , but when it was there I had no problem using it . Maybe its a little to slow for my camera but then I should buy a faster card . I have an Olympus e420 -LRB- DSLR -RRB- and 3 pictures in a second -LRB- about 6 MB each -RRB- is to much for the card . Btw , I have to use an adapter for the SD-Card to get it in my CF-Slot . No problem at all . 	CellPhone
This stylus does n't work great . Touchscreen contact is n't continuous , it 's intermittent , and quite weak . But practically I only paid for the shipping , so it was worth it . I repeat myself : nothing special at all , It hardly works . 	CellPhone
The vent mount attachment works but is a bit wobbly and the vent bounces up on bumps . As a result I did not feel comfortable using it for my phone . The suction cup mount works perfectly and has two adjustment points that can be tightened up so your phone position will not move . The included plastic disk attached firmly to my dashboard and allowed me to mount the suction cup holder exactly where I wanted it . I like how you can rotate the phone to either be upright or on its side . I have a Samsung Captivate and the adjustable side arms hold it tight without blocking any of the side buttons on the phone . The Captivate is also tall enough that the rear speaker is not covered . 	CellPhone
This bluetooth headset is a solid , everyday headset that performs well and is very comfortable . \* Call Quality - Hearing others is generally very consistent and reliable . However , occasionally , the person I 'm speaking with tells me that it 's difficult hear me sometimes . Overall , I would say 8 out of 10 times the calls are clear and consistent for both ends of the phone call . There 's always going to be some hiccups , but they are minimal . \*\* Design - I really like that small , but fine details of this bluetooth headset ! Sometimes it 's the small things that separate certain products from the rest . The most noticeable is the plastic curve that hooks around the front part of the ear . As opposed to looping around the back of the ear , it loops around the front . I feel that this makes the experience infinitely better . You can change the loop piece so that you can wear it on either your left or right ear . - The earpiece is covered with rubber and has a small piece that slighty curves into the ear . Again , it 's not typical , but it fits my ear perfectly and it can stay comfortably in my ear for long periods of time . - It 's stylish with the shiny , chrome finish around the edge of the bluetooth , and a black mosaic style pattern on the side cover . Very cool . - The volume -LRB- when bluetooth is worn on the right ear -RRB- , is on the top , where you can easily change the volume . When you press the side and hold , you activate the voice detection . Pressing the side once will accept or end a phone call . Good , basic , and easy functionality . \*\*\* Voice Detection - Although it 's not perfect , it 's very good . It gives you the option to adapt to your voice , which is very helpful . After letting it adjust to your voice , voice commands are usually accurate and spot on . \*\*\*\* Music Playback - I was n't expecting this , but it 's definitely a nice luxury . Just play the song that 's on your phone , and the bluetooth headset will play the desired song immediately . The quality is alright and a little bit airy . It 's not quite as good as your normal mp3-style earphones , but with volume turned up , there is definitely some distinct bass . Overall , a very good bluetooth headset , is comfortable , and can wear proudly in public . 	CellPhone
Thought this phone was like the the motv9 with some improvements . WRONG ! Does not work in Japan , wrong frequencies and has a truncated software set where you can not even change the volume of the tones that you hear when you dial a number . It is set at max and unchangeable . very irritating . the back label on this phone indicates it was built in brazil and probably for some provider in that market . The self learning keyboard is set up for some foreign language word recognition , certainly not english . I hate this phone after having owned the V9 , which after 4 years of faithful service , unfortunatley broke . You can get the V9 on amazon for the same price , so no reason to buy this lousy phone ... 	CellPhone
I have been using this headphone for A year and I Would not recomend them poor volume , barely can hear @ gym an its my secong pair . 	CellPhone
I prefer the anti-glare protectors . This one looks quite nice . Only issue is that it 's not quite `` sticky '' enough . The edges seem to be adhering nicely , but it wo n't quite stick around the `` ear-speaker '' hole . 	CellPhone
This mount was easy to set up and adjust for my iPhone 4s and use with MotionX-Drive turn by turn voice navigation app . Make sure you have a 12 volt outlet and charging cable to reach the smart phone to keep it charged ; the Navtech has a space in the mount for plugging the cable into the phone . 	CellPhone
It fits my phone perfectly and I 'm still able to do everything I want with it . It 's very pretty and well put together , so it seems to be lasting for awhile ! 	CellPhone
If you need a well built , fast and ultra portable computer with phone capabilities , Nokia N900 is the best option . iPhone is for people who want a good gaming device that makes phone calls . And those HTC Android phones look cheap . Android OS is the limited version of Maemo , so if you need full power of Linux on your device , N900 makes you happy . 	CellPhone
I have earned the right to give this phone 1 star , being that I have bought 2 in the past 3 years . As of Thursday night the 2nd one died and I do n't even want to get it fixed . I am convinced that this model -LRB- and maybe brand -RRB- is not of good quality . The screen went out on my first phone . My 2nd phone did the same thing so I had it repaired -LRB- for free because I only had it for 3 months -RRB- . Then 7 months later the phone would shut off with no notice with a charged battery . That went on for 3 months until the other night when the screen lit up but it was BLANK !!!!! I will never buy another Sony Ericsson AGAIN . Right now I have my eye on the LG VU . 	CellPhone
I bought two of these - one for my father , and one for my mother . My father was forever having issues pocket dialing , having phones do weird things -LRB- operator error -RRB- , having issues seeing the phone -LRB- macular degeneration -RRB- and in general , had issues all the time with other phones . I got him this , and it seemed to fix his problems . My mother 's phone is rarely used , but she has no issues with it either . It makes calls , receives calls , and has no issues . The phone is pretty simple - it CAN text , it has big buttons , clear screen , HARDWARE keyboard lock -LRB- very cool -RRB- , a flashlight -LRB- high intensity LED -LRB- good ! -RRB- - again , hardware switch -RRB- , and a FM radio -LRB- hardware switch - have n't really tested it , weird , but cool -RRB- . Phone receives as well as my ` fancy ' smartphone , sounds very clear both ways , and has decent battery life . It 's a good form factor too . The phone has the `` SOS '' button on the back , but we turned it off - I do n't want any ` incidents ' with that ... Do n't expect anything beyond a phone with this - it is NOT INTENDED to be anything BUT A PHONE . I saw some ` reviews ' on some other sites that complained about the lack of features - THAT IS THE PURPOSE OF THIS PHONE ... It makes it VERY good at what it is . Overall - I really like this phone . If I wanted something dead simple - this would be it . 	CellPhone
This thing is just Great , Nothing at all to get it working Supper Bluetooth Headset , can run two Phone or Like I did installed a Bluetooth USB Adapter into my Laptop and now I got Skype in my EAR also ... Do it you will like it ... . 	CellPhone
These are the first screen protectors I have bought . They worked good for me . The only thing I wish is that they would have come with instruction . It took a little time how to figure out how to put them on . I even asked my teenage daughter how to put them on and she did n't know , and she has had others protectors for her I pod touch .

I have had it since October and it is clearly the best phone I have ever owned . It has also replaced my camera , and I am now never without a camera . I attend a lot of concerts where cameras are almost always prohibited . They do n't give the phone a second glance , not realizing it 's got the 3.2 megapixel capability . I have got tons of fantastic shots from the last 4 shows . After throwing in a 1GB memory stick -LRB- I think it was $ 79 ? -RRB- it is now storing a half gig of my best music and the display says it will hold 300 + pics right now . The movie function rocks too , however you are going to want to be up very close to the subject . The sound playback of the movies is fantastic though , so at least concert videos make for good listening . The phone works flawlessly with my PC . If I throw it on the USB cable , it pops up instantly as another drive , just like the camera . Just drag on\/off the music and pics . All pics are very nicely numbered and named . If I do n't care about viewing the files and just want to move stuff on and off the phone , I do n't even take it out of my pocket . The bluetooth connection allows me to use their software to move things around . Also very cool was that it pops up on my computer as a Modem , which I actually was able to use immediately in my PC Anywhere program . In terms of being a phone , yeah it 's great . The contact list is easy to work with , the call clarity is no issue at all , good signal , no dropped calls , etc. etc. -LRB- this is all with Cingular -RRB- . Speaker phone works well . It needs charging about every 3rd day , charges very quickly . Charges slower but with the USB plugged in it also charges . The only thing I can think to complain about is that when using the USB cable to charge , it only wants to charge it to 89 % . If I want 100 % I have to throw it on the real charger for a few minutes . 	CellPhone
I bought one of these and really liked it ... for about six months until it stopped working ; no audio ; like the wire was cut . Stubborn guy that I am , I bought the same model again . I really liked how it fit my ear and sounded . Four months later -LRB- yesterday -RRB- headset number two died in the same way number one gave up the ghost . Am I willing to try for three strikes ? No way ! 	CellPhone
Is it socially acceptable for me to never , ever take these off ? As for sound quality , I 'm used to $ 100 + circumaural Sennheisers , and these provide a suitable -LRB- mobile -RRB- alternative . 	CellPhone
This phone was for my wife , who hated her Samsung Gravity-T . She had a very hard time navigating with the Gravity-T and the slide out keyboard was too small for her . The Behold has the vertual keyboard which is large enough for her to see without her glasses and also the touch screen is friendlier to her than the one on the Gravity-T . Although they are both probably the same technology , the Behold seems to be more user friendly even though it is an older phone model . With 3G capability , if she wants to upgrade to a WEB package , she can . Anyway , she is much more satisfied with the Behold . 	CellPhone
I had a great experience with this product . It was easy to put on , the customer service was great , and I 'm impressed with the screen protector so far . My husband ordered a different brand and was disappointed . He ended up using my spare . 	CellPhone
The stylus has a good weight to it ; however , the tip looks like it was put on in a mad dash . It was off center and it looks like part of the edge is coming out . Other than that , it works . 	CellPhone
Thought it would work for my verizon phone however after numerous emails to sf planet I learned that these headphones do not work . 	CellPhone
My son broke his Neon with over a year before he was eligible for replacement . Looking to replace without costing an arm and a leg I came across this phone . The phone was priced well and came quickly . We took his old SIM card out of broken phone , placed it in this phone and it was up and running immediately . I would buy this product again . 	CellPhone
Although the description on the web says TRI-BAND Amazon shipped to me DUAL BAND phones AND THEY REFUSE TO EXCHANGE THEM . DONT BUY IT UNLESS YOU LIVE IN EUROPE . I GOT STUCK WITH 11 PHONES that DO NOT WORK IN THE US . They event shipped it with the european plug . THIS PHONES ARE FOR EUROPE ONLY even though the webpages says they are triband . 	CellPhone
The case is as advertised , hard black metal . I appreciate having the connectors available so I do n't have to open it to sync using the USB cable . No problem opening or closing it . I do n't use the belt clip , so I ca n't comment on that . There is a storage location for one extra SDRAM plug-in . 	CellPhone
I love how clear this screen guard is . It was super easy to apply , almost too easy . It protects well enough for regular everyday use and abuse . Well worth the $ in my opinion ! 	CellPhone
Great headset . I have owned other Motorola headsets and the quality remains the same . 	CellPhone
I was so happy to know that SE was coming out with a android phone , but I still wait a whole year to buy this model because I know by expirience sony ericsson always has software issues with their phones , Im starting to realize that sony is not as good as they claim to be , their phone software is still has the same problems from 5or more years back , for example wifi connectivity , with my nexus one , my phone stays connected all the time even if the phone goes to a sleep mode , and when I go out my 3g mode kicks in , when Im back home my phone switches automaticly to wifi mode , sony ericsson phone are difficult to get connected to a wifi network , and dont let me get started on the other issues concerning their old and outdated interfaces , going back to the X10 they claiming is a 8 mp camera -LRB- whata joke ! -RRB- the pic quality is awful and they calling the little light they put on the phone a camera flash ... and the so call timescape is the biggest joke , the facebook or tweeter accounts never updates , I could be writing all day about all the sony issues , but I have a life to live , so Sony get ur thing right or people will gonna get tire of all the disappointments , I have everthing sony in my home , but im starting to see my other options for my next TV , music system , camera , and phones , well actually I have a HTC phone now , and is wonderful . . be careful sony ur going down !!!

If you are a simple phone user with 2 sim cards but do n't want to carry 2 phones around then this is the phone for you . If you are a smart phone `` super-user '' looking for all the smooth `` bells and whistles '' functionality then you 'll be disappointed with this phone . Pros : this is the best dual sim phone around . 1 . Caller\/picture ID on both outgoing and incoming calls -LRB- which many other dual sim phones do n't do -RRB- . 2 . One contact list for both sims . 3 . Easy to pick which sim to dial from . 4 . Voice quality good , load speaker good . 5 . Includes all the functions you expect to find on a smart phone \* -LRB- blue tooth , camera , Wifi , etc -RRB- . 6 . Flat enough to fit into tight jeans and looks cool . Cons : \* the functions will take some time to learn as they are not organized to be obvious -LRB- but once you get it you 'll be fine -RRB- . 1 . If you do a lot of texting or note taking , then this is NOT the phone for you . The touch screen keyboard is small and you 'll be punching multiple keys when you use your finger . There is no landscape view to make the keys bigger . But , the phone does come with an embedded stylist which works fine . 2 . Camera : picture quality is poor . OK with good sunlight . Feels like a 1.3 VGA camera . 3 . The touch screen is sluggish . Works better with the stylist -LRB- or nails -RRB- ... I usually use my pen . -LRB- the dial pad works fine with your fingers , the numbers are big enough -RRB- . 4 . No software suite to enter contacts easily . You 'll have to enter each contact one at a time . For someone like me with hundreds of contacts that 's a pain . What I did was to copy all the contacts from the sim to the phone , delete all from the sim , put the sim in the old phone , copy other contacts from the old phone to the sim , put the sim in this phone , copy all the contacts from the sim to the phone , and repeated this 'til all my contacts were transferred , which was better than having to type it all . I recommend this phone to anyone needing dual sim functionality . -LRB- 28-Apr-11 -RRB- . 	CellPhone
The power station takes forever to charge - much longer than charging an iPhone 4S or an iPad . If left with the switch off for over a week it loses its charge and must be recharged for hours . I charge with the iPad charger which is 10 watts and should work quickly . The pack will not fully charge a depleted iPad and you may get 1 -1.5 charges on your iPhone . This product does all things badly . 1 . slow to charge 2 . not much capacity -LRB- compared to its specs -RRB- 3 . Loses its entire charge if left alone . 	CellPhone
This a is very good product . I have used many other HeadSets . This is not only inexpensive , it also has very good quality . No noise or bad crackling sound . Have Fun !!!!! 	CellPhone
This review -LRB- especially its negative tone -RRB- partly applies to anyone looking to use this phone with TMobile as your carrier , since that 's my experience . But for all I know , the phone may be similarly stubborn about working with other U.S. carriers given that it 's a Euro-centric device made by a Euro-centric company . Therefore , I have to recommend that American customers stay away from this phone : despite its nifty feature set , there 's just too much risk of things going wrong , and unless you 're a mobile techie , it 's a major headache trying to fix the bugs -LRB- assuming they even can be fixed -RRB- . First and foremost , TMob does n't have proper configuration settings for this phone ; instead , they sent me settings for a `` similar '' phone , and when problems started to crop up , they told me those were the only settings available . Although I 'm still sorting some of these problems out -LRB- and may eventually fix most or all of them -RRB- , it 's been a major hassle so far , and one not hinted at in the many professional and amateur reviews I read before buying this model , most of which were very positive about its features and realistic about its limitations . So the sheer out-of-the-box user-unfriendliness really knocks this phone down several notches . The most annoying problems have to do with connectivity and how the phone communicates with online vendors . First , TMob 's settings make connecting via wifi -LRB- vs. TMob 's paid data plans , which I do n't participate in -RRB- a hassle : before I added their settings , wi-fi worked very well with my home network , but after adding the settings , wi-fi was automatically disabled whenever I tried to get online . I assume this would happen with other carriers besides TMob , given their interest in forcing you into paid plans . After much detective work , I finally figured out how to partly bypass that problem and access wi-fi , though the solution is by no means intuitive and is not a cure-all -LRB- e.g. , if you click on a URL in a txt message from , say , a ringtone or game vendor , the phone will default to TMobile 's Edge or whatever server and not even give you the option of switching to wi-fi , forcing you to use end-arounds that involve manually typing the URL you were sent into a browser , ugh -RRB- . So call this a mere partial fix at best . Second , if you want to order a game from TMobile 's store , you 're out of luck b\/c the settings wo n't allow you to download any of their games ; TMob told me there 's no way around that problem , so all the games I used on my previous phone are now unusable on the Nokia , and I ca n't buy new games either . And if you try to order a game from somewhere else , you 'll likely run into another problem that I still have n't solved : when you try to download the game after buying it , the store 's webpage will tell you that -LRB- DRUM ROLL -RRB- your phone IS N'T A NOKIA C3-01 ! Again , TMobile is to blame for much of this , and I may eventually find fixes for these and the other problems that have arisen . But then again , new problems are just as likely to pop up given the phone 's track record so far , and other carriers may have similar issues with this model , so it 's a definite thumbs-down . Who cares about nice cameras and touch screens if you 're too busy swatting at system bugs to enjoy them ? I may update this review if things improve and new solutions arise , but then again , none of that would change the fact that the phone is in some ways unusable at first , so I doubt I would change my recommendation . 	CellPhone
At first there were complications with the mailing of the product , but as soon as they found out the company resent the product and know i am enjoying it wonderfully ! 	CellPhone
the item I purchased is useless with capital letters ! The phone is freezing all the time ! I took it to the specialist to repair but he did not understand the reason why the phone is freezing . I plan to return it Back . 	CellPhone
OK , first of all , I do n't normally do reviews . But I have had bad luck with Bluetooth headsets and this one has impressed me right out of the box . First of all , any other headset I 've worn has caused my outer ear to ache after about 30 minutes of use ... no matter how I adusted them . But this one is like not having anything in your ear at all ! I bought it today , I 've been wearing it for three hours straight now and I 've literally forgotten it was in my ear several times . To be clear , there are two options for wearing this product . One involves a plastic loop as shown in the picture . The other , the one I 'm using is a soft rubber deal that just holds it from inside your ear . Sounds weird , I know . But it is seriously comfortable . Now that I 've beat that dead horse ... As I 've said , I 've only been using the H17 for a few hours , so take it for what it 's worth , but the sound quality seems to be just about the best I 've experienced in a headset for under $ 100 . It gets freaking loud ! I do n't have very good hearing and I had to turn it down at least half way . As a test of the noice cancellation feature , I made a call to my daughter from my garage and spoke to her while wrapping on the trashcans . She said she could barely hear the noise I was making but could hear me just fine . The only reason I give 4 stars instead of 5 is that the sound quality of the speaker is not quite as good as straight through my phone . By the way , the fact that it turns on and off via the flip out boom is a really nice feature . 	CellPhone
very good cases one of my favorite but wish they made the same one for the 1g iphone . 	CellPhone
I upgraded from an viewsonic 14 '' LCD which only support 1024x768 at 60hz . This monitor has vibrant colors and a sharp display . I currently use it with my pc and Hauppaugue WinTV 350 card . Watching full motion video is not a problem and is a pleasure in spite of the CableTV quality . For fast action sequences I do n't notice any ghosting or lag . I have only used the VGA connection and not the DVI connection since I do n't have an upgraded video card . The monitor so far is only a month and a half old and has performed wonderfully . The controls are easy and the automatic settings are adequate for most users . I gave this monitor 4 stars since I have n't been able to qualify the DVI connection . A very good product . 	Computer
I have the P2770FH set up in my home office as a second monitor . I 'm a graphic designer , and I work in Illustrator and Photoshop most of the day . This monitor is great , allowing me to work off my MacBook Pro with the addition of an HDMI cable and adapter . The super thin profile is great to save space in a small office like mine , the clarity and range of adjustment for color , brightness , contrast , etc. is incredibly helpful as well . I would definitely recommend this product to other designers . 	Computer
I use 2 of these at work in a dual display setup . They are beautiful displays , albeit a little warm though . Things I really like about the monitor : picture quality , input selection , menu controls The thing that kept me from giving 5 stars was the god-awful placement of the power button on the lower right hand corner of the bezel . Just slightly bumping it will turn off the monitor and the location of the button makes it prone to that . I ca n't tell you how many times I have inadvertently turned the monitor off . Very annoying ... 	Computer
The Sony SDM-S94 is a very nice monitor . The bezel is thin which makes it nice for pairing up with a second monitor . Color are faithful reproduced , I did not experience the color problem the other review mentioned . The performance of the monitor is fast with images , but not real fast when coming out of sleep mode . I have an analog version of the same monitor in a dual setup and the analog always comes on quicker . But , overall this is a fine 19inch monitor and I use it all day long . 	Computer
Compact and light than I thought . Fast and comfortable UI , far better than 2.3.3 GB . Nice renewed google Apps . It 's just AWESOME !! 	Computer
The Xoom is a good tablet , but will be a disappointment for someone looking for the qualities of an Apple product . As Android devices go , I think the Xoom is ahead of the pack , but there is a big gap between this pack and the next . Yes it plays flash where the iPad does n't , but Abode just gave up on mobile flash . Are multiple app stores really better ? Motorola\/Google , try harder . 	Computer
It a really great notebook the only reason why i didnt put five stars is because the poor audio it has , i can believe that an amasing notebook like this , has so poor sound . The performace of the centrino tc is really amazing and the battery last up to 5 hours with battery doubler . 4 of 5 	Computer
I was running out of ports on my Mac mini server . Not a problem anymore . It does exactly what it is supposed to ... connect more USB devices . It just works ! 	Computer
I recently brought a HP desktop and I wanted a HP monitor to match at a good price . On the HP website and on Amazon reviews this monitor constantly received a majority of high reviews . It is easy to setup , great looking display and the control buttons easily adjusts to how you want your screen to look . I am not a tech person so I just wanted a High Quality monitor at a great price and that is what I received . 	Computer
I 've been running the Adobe Creative Suite Premium , and this machine is truly amzing ; fast , fun and stable . It lives up to all its advertising claims ... . 	Computer
Very nice picture , stand adjusts nicely , but may reconsider since it runs very hot which means inefficient . I had read it was inefficient but did n't know to this extent . 	Computer
I 've used the 710N model for 2 years now . This monitor recently stopped working . My computer would be on and then the monitor would go black , the monitor would still be on but nothing shows up on the screen . I did a search on Google and found that this is a common problem across MANY of the Samsung LCD lines . The solution is to unplug the monitor for 5 minutes and plug it back in . This works , but now the monitor is doing this much more frequently . It 's something with the circuitry . I suppose it was good for 2 years but now I have to buy a new monitor because I ca n't find the warranty papers . Buyer beware . 	Computer
I am an avid Apple user , but recently procured a Xoom through my work for demo purposes . I also use an Apple iPad 3 , so I will compare against my experiences with that . Also , my Xoom is running 4.1.1 -LRB- Jelly Bean -RRB- . PROS : - Looks like Motorola is actually supporting their product in terms of software updates ! I used to carry a Samsung Android phone -LRB- the Galaxy S2 -RRB- , and updates were promised , but rarely came . Support is big . Google Now is a really cool feature , and is only available with Jelly Bean . - Performance is quick . The menus are snappy and I have n't noticed any lag . I use it for Internet , Netflix , and some applications -LRB- no gaming -RRB- . - Camera quality is decent , although I will probably never use them . CONS : - Weight ... this thing is a tank . I appreciate the build quality , but it 's much , much heavier than the iPad . - Screen quality is ... eh . It 's definitely not as sharp as other tablets out there . It 's not terrible ... it 's merely serviceable . - I also wish it charged via microUSB for convenience . Just another charger I have to lug around . Overall , I think the Xoom is a pretty worthy tablet . I 've also used the Samsung Galaxy series tablets , and I 'd choose the Xoom over them . 	Computer
I wish I had read his review -LRB- and the first review -RRB- before I bought one . This is the PERFECT machine - except for that lousy hard drive . Made that click every time it accessed the disk . Drove me crazy . The system lasted only 15 minutes before I took it back . Checked the demo in a retail store and it did it too . If you care about noise at all , stay AWAY from this computer . Broke my heart to return it . Ca n't find a thing with similar specs . If only Compaq would put 16MB of video ram into their 1720 instead of 8MB , that would do it . Or if Toshiba put a Intel-M instead of a regular Intel into the 5005 . Oh , well . Guess I 'll wait for the next wave of laptops ... 	Computer
This computer is awesome when it comes to power , mobility , and exterior design . At 4.7 lbs. , it is very light . Of all the centrinos out there , this is definitely the most eye catching . The only problem is that it can destroy the eyes as well . The native resolution for this computer is 1400x1050 which is great if you are a graphic designer . However , for those of us that use a computer to surf the web or type up documents , the resolution is unreasonable since text and graphics are almost 50 % smaller compared to other 14.1 '' screens out there . Sony should have kept the native resolution at 1024x768 like most other computer manufacturers ... this would prevent one from having to squint at the screen . One can manually change the screen 's resolution to 1024x768 but since it 's not native , details get blurred and text becomes fuzzy . I will return mine and wait till Sony releases a lower resolution version for real world users ... I really wish I could keep it , but squinting at the screen can get tiresome . 	Computer
Excelente Monitor , la resolucion ideal para trabajar con MS Office y navegar en la Internet , solo lo he probado con un juego Jedy Academy y es perfecto . Trae su cable DVI , no es necesario comprar uno adicional . Si tu tarjeta grafica tiene salida digital , no dudes en conectarlo alli . Altamente recomendado . Excellent Monitor , the ideal resolution to work with MS Office and to navigate in the Internet , I have just test it with a game Jedy Academy and it is perfect . It brings their cable DVI , it is not necessary to buy one additional . If your graphic card has digital output , do n't doubt to connect it there . Highly recommended . 	Computer
I 've had the Archos 70\/8gb tablet for several weeks , and mostly it 's been fine -- not an iPad for sure , especially with apps and online sites fouling out , and a lag that 's small but at times noticeable -- but in many ways it 's getting there . It 's great for music , movies , email , web , all the smaller functions like calculator , German lessons , Italian lessons , reader , and many many more . Angry Birds works fine . Had to add that , right ? However , I bought it mainly for its Bluetooth keyboard linking , because I write for a living , ride a bike and often work at coffee shops , and needed something small to haul around . The Archos had been working okay , despite the frustration of having to try several times before I can get its Bluetooth linked to the keyboard -- lots of starting\/stopping\/even restarting before it 'll work . Still , not so bad , tolerable for a new OS , been through that more than once and have some patience ... EXCEPT now , with the latest update -LRB- April 24 or 25 -RRB- , when I use my brand-new Apple bluetooth keyboard with the Archos , keys somehow stick and I get a gazillion Ts or Ls or whatever it sticks on , or it starts erasing and wo n't stop . Today it tried to erase an entire article I 'd spent two hours writing -- had to frantically turn it off to stop it . Same thing happens on Evernote , QuickOffice , notepad ... It 's definitely not the keyboard , as it does n't happen with my iPad or with a laptop . It 's some software screwup with Android , or with the Android versions of all these different apps -LRB- unlikely -RRB- . Archos\/Android are working slowly toward greatness , but sometimes the wait is a little frustrating . In the case of the keyboard stickies , the problem is , for me , huge . I can no longer trust it for its main purpose . Definitely ca n't take it to Europe in June , as I planned and which was another big reason I got it in the first place . iPad with keyboard is a little bulky for a backpack trip , and 7 '' was perfect . But I ca n't trust it . That 's extremely frustrating . Extremely . I want to love this thing . The size is perfect -- which is why I got this after already having an iPad . I 'm very disappointed in Apple\/Jobs for having this divine sense of certainty that only THEIR size tablet is the RIGHT size -- for multitudes of us out here , a 7-inch tablet is a godsend . I want the smallest reasonable-sized screen possible for bike trips to my coffee shop-second office , hiking , just overall packing light . For me , 7 '' is the sweet spot for screen , size and weight . But the Archos keeps fouling up a little here , a little there ... if it was just a music\/movie\/web machine , I 'd love it , even with pages closing abruptly and apps dying , which happens pretty much daily . I should note that I have the regular Android Store on this thing , so some of the apps I get have not been `` okayed '' by Archos . I suppose the drops are the reason they 're not on the OK list . So , I love the size and weight and most of the functions , but as a writing tool it has let me down completely , so now I 'm back to carrying the bulkier iPad around . iPad has everything almost perfectly on-target , except for the size and weight , thin as it is . I can absolutely rely on the iPad to do what it promises to do -LRB- I 'd give a lesser-used body part for a 7-inch iPad -RRB- . I want so much to feel the same trust for my little Archos . Hopefully , they 'll iron these things out and I can go back to the mini-world that I 've ... almost ... grown to love . Wow -- they almost had an Apple guy jump over to Android . Until this . Grrr . 	Computer
This is my first experience with a lcd monitor greater than 24 ' . The price ~ 220 at dell was very tempting , but I was vary since I 'd never heard of the Planar brand , but looking at the glowing reviews , pulled the trigger anyway . The box arrived damaged , thanks to UPS , but the monitor was safe , given the excellent packing . The monitor comes with VGA and DVI cords only , though it has a HDMI port . My laptop only has a VGA and HDMI port , but I had a spare HDMI cable lying around -LRB- who does n't , these days -RRB- that I hooked it up with . Wow , I was completely blown away by the picture quality , and thanked my luck for no dead pixels . The monitor looks good too , physically . The tilt with the provided base stand is minimal as others have pointed out and there is no height adjustment , but the monitor was big for my desk anyway , so I am using a desk stand with an VESA mount which took care of the tilt and height for me . The inbuilt speakers , as others have pointed out too are really bad , very tinny sound . I did n't care much since I have and excellent sound bar . So for the price I have no complaints . 	Computer
Well the wife tried for Fathers Day ... Today at 1am I had some free time and unpacked my new Fathers Day present , a L7EH . I was scared at a no-name monitor and only found reviews of it here . I read them all and took a risk and opened the box . I plugged it all in and fired up a Win2K Redhat 9 dual boot system . Funny ... no signal and the monitor does not appear to be waking up . I pushed on the power button and re-started it . OK why am I not getting out of boot ? Why is my PC doing a odd post beep ? . Bios Boot came up , Never finished the boot up sequence and no GRUB manager ... Odd ... I plugged my Gateway 19in Monitor back in and now I got to see the Bios boot again but in Yellow text !! and the bios boot failed . I plugged in a spare ATI All in Wonder Video card and everything worked fine . The Kogi\/GVision SMOKED MY Voodoo3 3dFX card ! Shame . . that was a fine little card that did VERY well for me over the years . The monitor was already packed up by 2am and now it 's time to return it to CompUSA and fight to get my money back for this piece of junk . 	Computer
Looked all over for sub - $ 900 unit with 1Gig and 100Meg + , and 64-bit processor . Never considered a Gateway , til I saw the beautiful screen , noticeably better than the HPs , etc. . I 'd say as good as a Sony screen . I actually like the keyboard , just a preference thing , though others appear not to like it very much . One note is to see the units with dual-core processors ... they 've dropped a few hundred in the past month since I bought this . Again , though , this unit is real nice for the price . 	Computer
It is very good monitor and I am satisfied with my purchase . However it 's just a monitor , nothing 's special . Although it is LED , it looks like a regular monitor . The only con to this monitor is the power button , it is kinda loose and sometimes you 'd need to press 2-3 times in order to turn it on . 	Computer
I purchased this monitor in October 2011 . Absolutely no issues with color as some older reviews mentioned . I believe Dell\/LG sorted those problems out so purchase in confidence . Picture-wise , this screen is amazing . I 'm running it on a 2011 MacBook Pro . Out of the box , the display was \* too \* vibrant for my tastes , associated to the extra color gamut afforded in the Standard preset mode . I switched it to sRGB and adjusted the brightness\/contrast a bit and BOOM , amazing picture . I previously used a 2009 iMac and this successfully replicates -LRB- if not surpasses -RRB- that screen . With the added bonus of being matte . The unit runs a little hot . You wo n't notice it sitting in front of the screen . But if you get curious like I did and reach around back , there 's definitely some heat being given off . It 's well ventilated , so no worries of overheating or anything of that sort . More of a curiosity , I suppose . It is , of course , 24 '' and lacks fans . What else would one expect ? Having the upstream\/downstream USB port is also really nice . And there 's a great cutout on the back of the monitor stand you can funnel your cables through , much like Apple provides on its iMacs and Cinema Displays . This really cleans up the desk and overall presentation of your suite . All that said , there are some issues for Mac users . Specifically for Mac users with Thunderbolt\/Mini DisplayPorts such as the late 2011 MacBook Pros . I first purchased a Mini DisplayPort-to-DisplayPort cable for under $ 5 from a well-known competing website . For whatever reason , the MacBook thinks the Dell is a TV and only outputs a YPbPr signal and not RGB . This is the wrong color profile and makes the colors will look dull and washed out . This is a well-known , unresolved issue at the moment and it 's likely attributed to the Thunderbolt\/MDP port on the MacBook and not with this particular cable . Hopefully Apple issues a firmware fix . It 's a shame because color aside , this is the preferred method to connect to this monitor : A small , single cable which also successfully puts the display into Power Saving Mode when idle . Which brings me to ... DVI issues . When it became clear I would n't be able to get an RGB signal out of the DisplayPort cable , I opted to pickup Apple 's official Mini DisplayPort-to-DVI adapter and use the Dell-provided DVI cable to attach to the monitor . Again , picture is great and unlike the DisplayPort cable , DVI correctly sends the proper RGB signal . But there are 2 downsides to using the DVI connection with -LRB- at least -RRB- my MacBook Pro & Thunderbolt\/MDP connection : - The MDP-to-DVI adapter is bulky and hangs off the MBP . It 's manageable , but nowhere near as slick as a slim MDP-to-DP cable . - More troublesome , the monitor never enters Power Saving Mode over DVI . This latter point is a stickler : Generally speaking , most computers have an option to put the monitor into power saving mode after a set amount of idle minutes goes by . And while this option exists on my MacBook and is properly set , the monitor never enters this power saving mode . The screen will clear of a picture , but the backlight will remain on . This is unlike the MDP-to-DP cable which can properly put the monitor into power saving mode . The good news is , using DVI , if you go to Apple -RRB- Sleep the monitor \* will \* go into power saving mode . So again , it 's manageable if a bit inconvenient . I constantly walk away from the computer to do something and come back and see the backlight still on . But if I know I 'll be stepping out for a while and manually put the laptop to sleep , all works as it should . So again , I have faith these problems can be fixed with a firmware update . Apple is apparently `` aware '' of the problems if you can trust what you read online ... These problems are well known amongst the U2410\/Mac contingency . Common thought -LRB- and I tend to agree -RRB- is the issue lies with Apple 's new Thunderbolt port . So hopefully these sticking points will be ironed out . All in all , a few nagging issues aside , this is a fantastic monitor . The size , price and performance are well worth it . 	Computer
I have had my little cherry mini for several weeks now and I could not be happier with it ! I needed a cheap little laptop since my less than year old HP died and my 11 year old dell laptop is on it 's last legs . This little guy fits the bill . Allows me to surf the net , respond to emails and generally just play around . It has great battery life , definately lasts close to 8 hours and is just easy to set up and start using . The cherry red color just makes me smile everytime I pick it up to use it . 	Computer
I had been thinking a lot about changing my CRT montior to LCD monitor . I was waiting for lower pricess , faster respons time & wide screen monitor . I was keeping my eye on Samsung , Benq & Acer . Last week , I visited JAREER Bookstoor in Riyadh -LRB- Saudi Arabia -RRB- I found this LCD . It really impressed me with the disign , the specs & the price . So , I could not wait anylonger & I got it . I will provide my comments about the disadvantages only because the advantages you may get it from the product specs . My comments are as follow : 1 - Does n't have direct Elictrical connectivity -LRB- you need Adapter which is comming with the package -RRB- 2 - It is really very difficult to connect the the power Cable & the regular -LRB- VGA -RRB- PC connection . 3 - Not perfect quality of picture if you use the VGA Connection while the DVI Connection is perfect . 4 - No flixpility to turn the monitor right or left because it is fixed . 5 - hight can not be adjusted . Some of you may ask how did I gave 4\/5 while having the mentioned disadvantages . Then I would say that this LCD monitor have many feature in one piece . It has TV tuner , Composite inputs , DVI Input , SCART Input , Nice Speekers . In addition , it comes with a remote control . The screen quality is very high & the side view is very sharp & clear . In conclusion this master piece has every thing you need . One last note , I purchased this monitor with a higher price than what you can get in the states . It costs me about 640 $ so you should be gratefull that the pricess in the states much lower . Regards , Abdulrahman Saudi Arabia - Riyadh 	Computer
I 'm not a monitor expert so I ca n't offer a deep analysis of this monitor , but as an average user and game player , it looks excellent ! The blacks are very dark black and the colors are vivid , it definitely looks better than other monitors I have around here . I did n't use the stand it came with , I am using a mounting bracket and that all hooked up very well . 	Computer
A great buy for only $ 160 . This monitor has features that you ca n't on monitors that cost twice that . The picture quality is excellent and the speakers are awesome for being built into it . I mean there are probably better monitors out there but for what I needed this is more than enough plus for the price you pay for what you get you ca n't beat it . 	Computer
First of all , if you need a Windows 7 tablet there is precious little alternative . It 's a real bonus that the Professional version is included . -LRB- The ` Offline Files ' feature means that bulk synchronising can be completed seamlessly in the background to a home NAS or other computer . -RRB- The packaging is better than expected and the items included mean that extras are not required immediately upon purchase -LRB- for example the dock and case -RRB- . The build quality appears to be good and performance is acceptable -LRB- as a Windows computer -RRB- . One thing to check prior to purchase is that there appear to be several models that are not readily identified . One option includes GPS , which would have been particularly welcome , but was not included with mine . Unfortunately that is the end of my list of ` pluses ' . The touch-screen seems somewhat intermittent , and does not always recognize input has been made . The Windows 7 interface is not ideally suited to finger input , being too small on this native resolution , and the stylus is only marginally better . While the stylus is an improvement over previous generations , there is still a noticeable lag for touch input . The on-screen keyboard is diabolical in comparison to the iPad , with keys being too small , the keyboard being poorly positioned and appearing disproportionate . The docked position -LRB- of the onscreen keyboard -RRB- is little better . tHe keyboard does not always appear when required and one must resort to the hardware switch -LRB- which appears to instigate a different instance and display of the keyboard -RRB- . The use of a Bluetooth keyboard and trackpad would be a distinct advantage if this is your only traveling device . Another saving grace is that the Remote Desktop feature is enabled in Windows 7 Professional , facilitating admin tasks when at home base . There are the usual issues of managing a Windows computer , monthly updates and the necessity for A-V & firewall . If you want or need one of these you will appreciate that it is no iPad competitor . However , as a replacement for a Windows net-book , it is acceptable . And with an SSD , the performance and resumption from sleep\/Hibernate are acceptable . Finally , having used an iPad for a year and never needed a screen protector , this is an absolute must for the Slate . The screen has a prominent scratch within a week -LRB- apparently from the stylus -RRB- . I 'm keeping mine for the moment , but will also try the Playbook as a traveling companion -LRB- I 'm a new BB handset convert , which is a plus but not a necessity for this device -RRB- . Despite my desire for the tablet format , I 'm not sold on touch or stylus input . I will probably end up with a MacBook Air for the same weight , larger screen , better battery life and performance . 	Computer
A gift idea for my wifes birthday was an android tablet . I had done a lot of reading on various offerings and stumbled upon the pre-order of this tablet . I quickly read the pro 's and cons on various tech sites , and combined with their good reviews and our experience with toshiba in the past -LRB- 2 high end laptops that are going on 4 years -RRB- I decided to go ahead and pre-order this as it was scheduled to ship a week or so before her birthday . Now let me say that I heard about the standby problem that required a reboot and I was nervous about first gen tablet . On top of that my wife has stated she no longer wanted a tablet , as she could n't see a use for it . I almost returned it , but decided she could do so if she really did n't want it . Those fears were unfounded . As soon as she got it she was overjoyed . There was an update from Toshiba to address the standby issue and we have had no problems . Although a bit thicker than other tablets , it is very light and feels good in the hands . The rubber grip back is fantastic and even our die hard ipad owner friends said they would like that feature as they have almost dropped theirs numerous times . Toshiba did not load bloat ware on this device . Out of the box the OS looks clean and is very responsive . The ability to replace the battery is also a great decision by toshiba , as now we have a spare and if one battery dies we wo n't need to send it for repair , saving us money . it also comes with USB , HDMI and SDHC slots . Overall I would recommend this to someone looking for an android tablet that will last . 	Computer
I got this monitor for work . I just love it ! I was pleasantly surprised at the clarity of the images once I `` programmed '' the image settings -- which was easy to do -LRB- touch buttons on panel to modify -RRB- . The screen size was larger than my old monitor , which made viewing easier on my eyes . This was an added bonus , since I work on the computer all day . For the price -LRB- great value -RRB- , I think this is a great monitor . I would highly recommend for those who are budget conscience and value shoppers . 	Computer
I ca n't imagine why I waited so long to get this . I looked for over a year and compared a lot of different tablets . This one is wonderful , everything I wanted and more . 	Computer
Ca n't get games to come up on it , It tells me I need to download adobe flash to do anything but all it will do is freeze up on you without downloading the player , to be able to download anything from the apps it says you have to download the player . Very dissappointed in this tablet , I bought it back in Nov. did n't open till Christmas , to late to send back now ... 	Computer
OK , so I got this tablet . And was so ridiculously excited it is n't funny . The first week was a nightmare . I was inches from sending it back . -LRB- PLEASE keep reading though -RRB- The app library it comes with -LRB- appslib -RRB- sucks , and crashed most times I tried to use it . I got rid of that , and installed the regular Android market . Then I was having a problem with my tablet rebooting , alot , whenever it wanted to . Asked Archos what to do and they instructed me to force it to install the newer firmware -LRB- and they gave instructions how to do so -RRB- . Did that and it has been perfect ever since . It is great for games , including Angry birds . Movies are great on it , music too . E-books are great . Web browsing is great . Email is great . The wifi it has is better than my HP laptop . The screen is a true touch screen -LRB- your finger -RRB- , you do n't need a stylus or to tap it with your nails . The camera works well enough for me anyways -LRB- As good as my Android phone -RRB- . The gravity sensor is great , no matter which way you turn it , the screen flips . A few apps I like wo n't work , but I think the app itself requires a cellular signal , not just wifi for some reason -LRB- Slacker Radio -RRB- . The leg , although I thought it would n't work , did and it 's not topply or anything . The screen does glare in sunlight , but so does any Android touchscreen I have seen . Transferring files from PC to it is super easy . WELL worth the money , especially in comparison to say , the Motorola XOOM that is at least 2x the price and less storage . I would do it again , even with the hiccups in the beginning . Comment on here if you have a question and I will do my best to answer : -RRB- 	Computer

I 've been on the hunt for a good reasonably-priced LED monitor for a while -LRB- I wo n't start on this ... -RRB- , something that I will find to my satisfaction in its features and picture quality . I think I 've found it . I mainly came to the decision based off the rating ratios , and with the knowledge that even highly-rated items can sometimes lead to disappointment . This one seemed to have the highest proportion of 5-star ratings , and it did have much of the features I was looking for : LED , -RRB- 23 '' , GLOSSY , few complaints about color and viewing angle , and high customer satisfaction based on ratings . There are actually very few LED monitors out there that are glossy , and I 'm so glad this one is a glossy screen . I 'll let you know that on my initial purchase , I was sent a unit that was somewhat of a disappointment . The screen overall looked good , but for some reason , the contrast at the top appeared to be darker than the contrast on the lower half the screen . This is ASIDE from the usual TN monitor viewing angle issues that usually has to do with color . Interestingly , the contrast issue was such that the top did also produce a more pinkish tint . It was kind of annoying even sitting 5 feet away at eye-level . I queried several reviewers and looked through what customers have noted , and it did n't seem like anyone had this problem . Some also reported pretty even colors throughout when sitting in front . I gave it a shot and had it exchanged , without any clue if the next unit would have the same issue -LRB- e.g. , was it just me who was picky ? -RRB- . Lo and behold , my 2nd unit looks more like the one people are giving 5 stars ! The contrast top to bottom is MUCH more even , without that pink tint at the top , and the whites look VERY GOOD throughtout the screen , much improved form the last unit . -LRB- Currently ? The white appears 95-98 % even across the screen at 4 feet away or more , and one may detect an extremely subtle pinch of off-white\/yellow if you sit closer or if you scrutinize the screen for 1 minute -RRB- . Unfortunately , this means that not all units are made the same , but I 'm glad I finally ended up with a unit consistent with reviews AND satisfies my expectations for a monitor in this price range . So here I go with an outline of my review : PROS - Excellent screen size for daily student use . I can sit back much further with less strain on my eyes and posture while still getting great viewing range at eye-level . Given that the resolution is 1080p , 23 '' might be good for DPI , but 23 '' is slightly on the smaller range , and I wanted a larger screen size coming off of my 21 '' previously . 27 '' would have been a good size , but then DPI would have been less attractive . It 's a delicate balance here , and 25 '' is JUST right , for me . - Excellent contrast and brightness . I use about 80 % and 80 % . For reported 250 cd\/m2 on this screen , even 80\/80 is brighter than my `` 300 cd\/m2 '' of my Dell Studio XPS 16 screen -LRB- which inspired me to find LED monitors -RRB- . - Very good viewing angles for its class . TFT-TN monitors will always suffer the same issues , but not all suffer the same extent . I 've definitely seen many models\/many different brands that have varying degrees of viewing angle satisfaction . Yes , if you lean off center side to side , the further end will start to have a light yellow tint . But let 's say you are watching a film\/video , and u stand maybe off to the side a bit -- you can still see what is going on and you may not even notice much distortion in color\/contrast unless you really stare at the screen with scrutiny as you come to the center . If it has n't bothered me , I do n't think it will bother most users who are buying monitors of this class . Believe me , I 've seen pretty bad ones . - White is more white , black is more black . The `` LED white '' is one of the main reasons to upgrade from a regular LCD monitor . The white is very good especially when you are on center at least 4 feet away . The black is a pure , deep black and smooth and consistent throughout the screen . No backlight bleeding , by the way ! Makes black-background webpages and movies very neat to look at . - Excellent color representation for its class . As you may know , TFT-TN monitors will still have the issue with viewing angles . On center , the left and right are pretty symmetrical and similar\/same as the center . Top to bottom , with colors that are not back , you will notice a gradual gradation of color as you scan top-to-bottom , but that is typical , and the issue is actually less on this monitor than on many others I 've seen . Only IPS monitors can resolve this , if you 're really demanding that . I 'm not really complaining . : -RRB- - Sharp and crisp . Text at 80 % contrast and 80 % brightness is excellent . That 's all . - Easy-to-use buttons . The buttons are actually located on the underside of the screen with labels facing you . The functionality is pretty easy to figure out and not complicated . There 's a function to turn off the Power light if you choose to , but I like to keep it on , as it has a nice neon-teal color to it . When activating the monitor from sleep , there is virtually no waiting time for things to show up except for monitor-based prompt menu that says which plug is detected -LRB- disappears in 2 seconds or so -RRB- . - Stable base and support . Just in case people wanted to know . The monitor will only shake a little when you 're touching the buttons or handling the monitor with your hands . Otherwise , it is very stable . - Glossy . I 'm a fan of glossy screens . I wo n't go into a battle between matte vs. glossy , because both have its pros\/cons . I favor glossy over matte because : 1 -RRB- In any lit room or with windows or whatnot , all my matte screens I 've used experience complete screen washout . You basically ca n't make out anything because the light reflecting off the surface is diffuse and goes across the entire surface . However , with glossy , I 've never been bothered by reflections , and even in bright lighting situations , the most you get is a reflection of that source , but it is localized and does not wash out the whole screen . Plus , I probably just subconsciously adapt to it and maybe move my head over 1 inch or ignore the light completely . 2 -RRB- Glossy in any lit room seems to provide better clarity and richness in color\/contrast . -LRB- In complete darkness , matte vs. glossy appear pretty much the same . -RRB- CONS - It 's not IPS , but hey , it 's got deep black that is consistent throughout . For $ 230 -LRB- when I bought it -RRB- , this is one of the best in the TN class that I 've seen , and met my expectations . The viewing angle descriptions I described above . - Does not rotate and does not have vertical adjustment . Minor complaint , but I have my monitor on a stand so I can keep it eye-level . It would have been nice to have such features though . - You may get lucky and get a good unit . But you may also get something slightly disappointing . If you suspect that there may be some flaw or fault to your unit , it 's probably not you or your eyes -- it 's the monitor . Amazon helped me with the exchange process very easily , and now I am absolutely happy with my new unit . This is a quality control issue that likely applies to any product you choose , no matter how good they reportedly are . But if I were you , I - would - believe the 5-star ratings , and you should get a unit that meets those standards . - This is very picky , and I 'm sure most people wo n't notice , but if you are within the range of 1-5 feet from the monitor and you look away the monitor but keep it enough in your peripheral vision , you might see subtle indication of flickering off to your peripheral vision esp with white background and dark text\/lines . Not a biggie , I think it 's normal for LEDs to do that -LRB- although my Dell Studio XPS 16 WLED screen does not -RRB- . Just to be clear , there is NO OBSERVABLE FLICKERING when viewing directly at this HP monitor . I tried to include commentary about features or issues that I did not see any other viewer describe . For instance , few will talk about the vertical viewing angles at eye-level , which for me is a bigger issue than side-to-side viewing angles . I 'll just you know that this is the best TFT-TN monitor I 've been able to find so far that is glossy and LED . You can expect high-quality from this product , and I hope I 've been able to help you in making a decision when searching for a monitor of this class to purchase . My rating is CONFIDENTLY 4.9 \/ 5 for a good unit , and I 'm not counting off too much for viewing angles , as I 'm not trying to compare to IPS class monitors . Anyway , enjoy ! FYI , at the time of writing this review : 5 stars : 63 -LRB- 75 % -RRB- 4 stars : 19 -LRB- 23 % -RRB- - includes issues that even as someone as picky as I am can live with . 3 stars : 1 2 stars : 0 1 star : 1 5-stars + 4-star ratings = 98 % Pretty impressive .

The Asus VH198T is easily one of the best LCD 's available in its price class . The picture is vibrant and bright , helped greatly by this model 's LED backlighting . For years LCD 's have suffered from very poor contrast ratios that make blacks look more like charcoal gray , and while the 10,000,000 to one contrast -LRB- I 'm assuming that 's `` dynamic contrast '' -RRB- is questionable at best , the fact is that contrast is much , much better than the LCD 's of even just a year or two ago . The screen is bright , the colors are vivid , the blacks are deep and everything is sharp -LRB- when run at the proper resolution , anything less than the native 1440x900 will result in a blurry picture , although that 's typical of all LCD 's -RRB- . The picture is simply the best I 've seen on any similarly priced model . I work in IT procurement and we had been buying HP LCD 's , but I gave Asus a shot based on the reputation they 've earned through their components and netbooks , and I 'm very glad I did . I 've deployed nearly 200 of these at various locations and I have yet to experience one with a burnt or stuck pixel . I realize that 's probably just luck , but some LCD 's have been prone to having them . I think it 's safe to say that the VH198T is n't one of them . If there is anything to complain about -LRB- you know , for the sake of complaining , full disclosure and all that stuff -RRB- , then I 'd have to point at the speakers . Most people would much prefer to use separate speakers or headphones with their PC , but in the event that you 're planning to use the dual 1 watt speakers built-in to the VH198T , you 're probably going to want to upgrade . They 're ok for listening to voicemails or maybe some streaming talk radio , but are sorely lacking for music or gaming . Also , as mentioned , the sticker at the bottom of the LCD does leave residue on the bezel , and it 's very difficult to get off . That 's the end of my gripes . Overall , I ca n't recommend the VH198T enough . I 'll continue to purchase them until it reaches end of life . 	Computer
Over the years I 've been building my trust in Samsung products . I had such good experiences with their products so when I needed a monitor , I straight went to see Samsung products . The price was very reasonable , and the quality was excellent . I love it and I 'm pretty confident this product will last me forever just like my dvd and tv set from Samsung . 	Computer
I did a great deal of research on this item before I asked for it for Christmas . -LRB- I actually asked for the Archos 7 , but then saw the Archos 70 about a month before Christmas . My wife almost hit me when I mentioned it . Turned out she had already purchased the Archos 7 , which I returned with her approval -RRB- . I travel quite a bit and as I am getting older I have a hard time seeing the screen and videos on my IPOD Classic so needed something bigger . I thought the IPAD but when I really thought about the price and how I would use it I could n't see shelling out the $ 600 . Most folks seem to almost use their IPADs as a status symbol ... They like to show that they have one , but really only play games on it , surf the web and watch videos on them . The Archos 70 is priced right and because of the price I think it is actually better than the IPAD . I do everything on it I would have done on an IPAD . The IPAD may be a little better here and there but not $ 300 better . Sort of like the difference between a good $ 20 bottle of wine and a great $ 150 bottle of wine . Can you tell the difference . . yes . Is the difference worth the extra $ 130 . . not for most folks . So if you just like IPADs and you have some extra money , go for it . Or buy two Archos 70s . One for you and one for your wife . What I like : 1 . Light and about the size of a Kindle -LRB- I picked up the Kindle app on the Android Market place -RRB- . In the vertical I can hold the pad and type e-mails with my thumbs without shifting my hands . 2 . I do n't need a software application , like Itunes , on my computer to sync and move videos , music , etc to my Archos . You just drag it to your tablet . 3 . I can see my other computers on my network and I have downloaded items from the shared drives . 4 . When I rip my DVDs I do n't have to convert them to an MPEG4 -LRB- which is what you use for an IPAD -RRB- , the Archos can read an . AVI file . This means you only have to rip the DVD , there is no need to covert to a different format . This saves me a few hours . 5 . Expandable with a mini-SD card . As soon as I received my Archos 70 I ordered a carrying sleeve , a screen protector and 16 gb mini-SD card . 6 . External speakers , which are good enough that I can listen to Pandora while I work in the Kitchen . 7 . The kickstand seemed gimicky at first but I find myself using it more and more I would n't be scared of some of the comments that you have to be a techy type to get to the android market . I put off doing it for a day or two just because it seemed like a hassle . But all you do is download the file from ArchosFan.com , move it to your Archos 70 -LRB- just like moving music or a video . . drag and drop ... and then click on it in the Archos70 file manager . -RRB- Worked great . I would recommend updating your pad first to the newest Android available for the Archos 70 and that can be done from the Archos.com site -LRB- You do this just like moving music or video ... drag and drop ... and then click on it in the Archos70 file manager . -RRB- The upgrade is almost like a practice run for the download for the Android market . What I did n't like : 1 . The standard apps that come with the Archos 70 are okay , but the Archos library is not all that great . Once you get the Android market place you wo n't use the Archos library . 2 . I have to use the power plug to charge the Archos 70 , does n't look like it charges through the usb connection .

This has been a nice gadget for me . Nothign over the top , but i love it none the less . Music plays well . it does n't hook to itunes , and it sorts all music automatically . thats a little annoying having all the singles come up in album and artist view , but i ignore it . you have to put playlists in manually . buuuut . the speakers are FANTASTIC . i woudl say 3 times as loud as ipods ? screen is bigger , and internet connection is solid . it does n't have multi touch , but the camera works great in good lighting . i could n't tell the difference between pictures taken with my archos and my digital camera as long as it was daytime , outside ! i find it work a bit like a computer . after sitting around for awhile , it gets slow and has to warm up for a few seconds . also does n't work well at low battery . a lot of people would get frustrated with it , bu tit has many redeeming qualities and most of the time , is awesome . and , and by the way , Sweet ! I 've just received my free minecraft giftcode ! >> Minecraftcodes . info << apparently , minecraft is on android now . my life is complete 	Computer
I decided to get myself a new gadget this Christmas . But having a budget in mind , I could n't afford the Ipad , so Creative ziio it is . It seemed to be a good choice as it 's relatively affordable and suits my budget . What I like\/enjoy : 1 . Sound quality : The speakers are loud - useful when sharing music or videos with my friends . Sometimes I just play music directly from it while I 'm home . I like it : -RRB- 2 . Lightweight : Given that we girls do n't really enjoy carrying too much bulk around , this fits nicely into my handbag , even with the leather case on . And it 's not heavy at all . Feels just like a book in my hand . 3 . Screen : I am not sure if the touchscreen seems to be a trouble , but it does n't cause me much hassle . My boyfriend owns an Ipad and I notice the differences in the touch experience . With ziio though , I find that the screen responds quickly to the provided stylus . Sometimes I even use my fingernails , which works as well - something which i can not do on the Ipad . The screen is also really bright and all i have to do is to drag the videos into the ziio folder and viola it plays ! 4 . Store for apps : It has a store that recommends apps , which I can browse , download and install . It 's quite easy to use : -RRB- What I dislike : 1 . Front camera - I feel that the front camera could be better , because the current quality is average . 2 . No 3G - May not be convenient while commuting . I heard there are some ways to hook up your handphone 's 3G to the ziio but i have yet to try that out . I hope Creative will improve on this . Just my 2-cents , hope that helps ! 	Computer
The SyncMaster BX2231 arrived on time , as promised . The colors are bright and vibrant and contrast is outstanding . The control buttons -LRB- touch the lower RH side of screen -RRB- can be a little temperamental . I do n't always get the controls to adjust as I try to change the settings . Finally got the setting adjusted and it made a huge difference . I 'd buy this monitor again . 	Computer

I waited a few days -LRB- week -RRB- before writing a review just so I could get a feel and use of the NEC PA271 . After researching and looking at so many aspects for a good if not great monitor I finally ordered the NEC . Make no mistake this is a high-end color accurate display with a very strong build . The appearance alone look top notch pro series . Initially the display is bright and contrasty yet neutral in the grays but after calibration using the Spyder3 Elite this took on a new feel . VERY good color\/temp\/neutrality in the grays and the ability to select both white point and brightness created an excellent viewing experience . Compared to an Eizo I saw which was very nice , there 's absolutely no reason to think the NEC is a lesser display of not in my opinion better when one considers the image and color quality at a MUCH better price range . I ignored ALL reviews that griped about instruction and setup etc. . I did n't even bother with those since anyone with a fraction of experience can set this display up no problem . I have it connected to a MacPro using the DVI supplied cable and the ATI 5870 - it 's simply great . I wo n't hesitate to recommend this display to anyone in the photography field or graphic design field - I ditched my Apple led 's and have not a single regret in doing so as this display is a superior product for color critical work . Bottom line is that the top authorities on color management will mention this NEC or the 30 '' one over the Eizo or LaCie 's . Outside of these three brands it 's not worth considering anything else but my vote goes to the NEC . -LRB- incidentally LaCie uses the NEC but with an added price bump -RRB- . Again though you will need to calibrate with either the NEC spectra view or in my case I used the Spyder3 Elite . 	Computer
Arrived promplty , works great . Do n't forget to order an optical cable if planning on connecting with that type of connection . 	Computer
Guys , I needed something cost effective since I was giving this to my 5yr old son . I needed a device he could listen to music , watch his animations , plays games with the added benefits of some learning apps . I researched for 3 days and this was the only device within my budget that could do all I needed . I saw the bad and the good reviews and decided to take a chance . I have since regretted that decision . I got it , loaded some apps and videos then said to my self '' I am lucky it is working great '' two hours after handing it to my son the screen started flickering , the power button does not respond and reseting it did nothing . It was completely unusable . Beyond the show stopper , the other negatives is the sound which was very low -LRB- do not think I did maximize the volume . I do IT for a living -RRB- , so low its best to use a head phone . The only reason it got a 1 star was because I could not give it a negative 0 . Take my advise do not purchase this device . 	Computer
I ordered this item , off because I wanted a new LED monitor with HDMI to use with my pc and game consoles . Add in the 3D capability and I was sold instantly . The color , contrast , size -LRB- upgrade from 19 inch -RRB- and in full 1080p greatness !! 2D display quality is amazing ! Far better than the standard HP monitor I was using . 3D display looks great as well , slight ghosting in some cases . Seems to work much better with the included TriDef software on the PC than playing games in 3D on PS3 , which there is a noticeable loss in quality . Not a fault of the display , something that is necessary for the PS3 to push out 3D video . Overall great item , and I would highly recommend it to anyone looking for a great monitor and the occasional 3D fun . 	Computer
Just purchased this 15 '' LCG monitor and love it . I replaced a Sony CRT 17 '' and found the viewable area to be equal to the CRT . Colors are brilliant and text sharp . Plug and play , with no need to utilize any additional software . At 9 # and slim depth my Desktop looks like a desk again . Set at 1024x768 32bit true color . I could ` nt be more pleased 	Computer
I bought this device for my wife for Christmas this year . I have mixed emotions about it and figured I 'd see if anyone else had comment about it . Pros : ------ - Creative makes great audio devices . This follows suit IMHO . The a2dp bluetooth works great , and I even like the X-Fi codec enhancement . - I appreciate not being roped into crap like iTunes where my music is wholly unavailable without an Apple product to save the day . I can download from Amazon 's MP3 store and things are just fine and dandy . I just have to do it from a computer and copy it over to the device manually -LRB- you could use software I guess -RRB- ... - It is pretty small for a tablet but still big enough to see easily . - Android is open which opens the future of this and other Android devices if you like to hack around . It 's cheaper than an iPad by a long shot and both will be old and janky three years from now anyway . -LRB- Remember the 1st gen iPod ? They look like they were made in the 60 's ... -RRB- Cons : -------- - Does n't seem like a polished product . A lot like a '97 Mazda 626 was but with less expensive problems . I am looking forward to some software updates out of Creative but am not holding my breath . - The ziistore apps and stuff on the device are lame links to websites . They really do n't help much and the pages are not really designed for display on the danged thing . Does n't present well . - Really not built for non-technical people . To install the Kindle software I had to go find it on my computer , download the APK , connect via USB to the tablet , copy the file , eject the tablet , check the thing to allow third party apps , and then install it manually using the file browser . Maybe I missed something , but searching in the ziistore `` app '' did n't ever once return any results no matter how much I tried . Getting music for\/copied to the device was similar in nature and was in no way `` intuitive '' . The emusic.com store did n't seem very well thought out either and we had to go through gyrations to actually get the music downloaded at all . - No multi-touch . Anyway , it might sound like I 'm down on this device . I 'm not . It 's actually a nice device considering the money people are spending on these things . It does have a resistive touch screen , which is a little crappy these days , but that 's really not that big of a deal I guess . 	Computer
These monitors are great ! I purchased two and was very surprised at the quality . The stand moves up , down , left , right , tilts , rotates , all with ease . My previous monitors did n't move around very easily . These also turn on very quick , and when I calibrated the monitors both were already very close to perfect . 	Computer
The wife bought one a few months back and likes it . So I bought two -LRB- dual monitors -RRB- She never told me that when clicking on a video -LRB- any one . avi , mov , mkv etc. -RRB- the screen goes black for about 2 sconds or so . And when you close the video ... black again for the 2 seconds or so . Since she works with text mainly it 's not a big deal for her . But I work in graphics and video . Major PITA . Hanns wants info so they can get them serviced but if it 's the same with all 3 I doubt even replacing them will help . Also interesting is that you do n't get a DVI cable with them . Which I find odd since it does have a DVI port . Just comes with a vga and a DVI to HDMI . When I first plugged them in , the old DVI cables I had on the old monitors -LRB- an asus and a samsung -RRB- would n't work . So had to use the odd DVI\/HDMI combo . All in all ... not a happy camper . 	Computer
I purchased one of these from Fry 's for $ 88 and then added an 8 GB micro sd -LRB- I think it was $ 14.99 -RRB- . I expected it to perform slow and do limited tasks ... and it does . Mine has 802.11 B\/G wireless NOT 802.11 n - so do not expect fast internet -LRB- e.g. . You can get a hack for netflix but it is so slow you ca n't even watch it -RRB- . Games like angry birds run well sometimes , but other times can be slow and jerky -LRB- cut the rope and the jewel games seem fine -RRB- . The eBook reader is good . No issues there . You can watch movies on it which you load through the USB port -LRB- MP4s -RRB- . Email works fine - I connected my yahoo account to it in about 30 seconds . Pandora works great -LRB- though it is difficult to kill -RRB- . Stored music -LRB- MP3s -RRB- play fine . Also , mine has an 800mhz processor ... not a 1Ghz as this spec states -LRB- hmmm ... the description on Amazon here is a bit weak -RRB- . I ca n't speak to the problems people have had with it arriving DOA . I have had mine for several months and no issues . Use the stylus ... you can use your finger but it will just make you angry . So , use it to play some games , read eBooks , check your email , listen to tunes , and watch movies you have transferred to it . Do n't compare it to an iPad , Samsung tablet , or a Kindle fire . If it is worth $ 93 to you to do the above , then buy it . If not , save your cash for something else . But if you are flying to Hawaii and plan ahead it can keep your kids busy for 3-4 hours before the battery dies - and if you forget it on the plane ... well you 'll be glad it was n't an iPad .

I agree with the earlier reviewer who said that there is a very limited vertical viewing angle in order to get consistent contrast . Otherwise a very decent monitor for its price . 	Computer
I bought this monitor from computer direct a couple months ago , and I have been very satisfied with it so far . Some specifics from my purchase experience were : 1 . The clarity and contrast are exactly what I was looking for in a monitor , and spec for spec , it is a bargain compared to other brands . 2 . The computer direct processing and shipping was outrageously fast . I ordered it on a Monday afternoon -LRB- around 2 PM -RRB- and with no extra shipping costs , the monitor was at my door in Chicago by the time I got home from work Tuesday . 3 . The stand is by far the most inferior aspect of this monitor . It will only move the monitor side to side -LRB- no up\/down or tilt feature -RRB- . However , the view angle on this thing is so big that you will see very clearly on any desk\/viewing situation you normally run across . 4 . Just in general , make sure your graphics card can handle the native screen resolution on this monitor . Many computers from 2003 or before may not be able to . 5 . I have seen no dead pixels or color bleeding that I 've heard about with other ACER models 	Computer
This is the best monitor , hands down . ... <p> I compared it to my recent 15.4 '' laptop , 15 '' desktop Acer and 15 '' Envision . Result ? Cornea beat them all and it was so mich brighter and crisp than others . What a picture ... 	Computer
I 've got this setup as a HTPC and it works great streaming Hulu\/youtube via a wireless N router . The router sits across the house and the connection is still strong enough to not have to worry about it . 	Computer

When the monitor first arrived , I loved it , it 's big , bright , beautiful display . And then 60 days after arrival the HDMI port gave out . Just stopped working . So I ca n't use it with my MAC anymore , or my ROKU , just and old laptop that happened to have a VGA attachment , the picture quality is not good with VGA . 	Computer
A very good LED Nothing bad , works great and the picture showing excellent . need some ajustment at the begainning . 	Computer
Someone gave it 4 stars , how ? It is small , easy to use , and does exactly what it is supposed to . The little screws that hold it to each piece are even there , for both the piece\/device you are attaching to and the cable coming in . Worked great ! Has to be 5 stars . 	Computer
This unit worked great ... then it went dead . I contacted warranty services and they offered to repair the unit . However , I HAD TO PAY FOR THE SHIPPING FEES !!! 	Computer
I ca n't go back to using anything else at all . Make sure you have a nice , smooth mouse , as well a rig that can push out -RRB- 120 FPS on most games . Even my SLI 570 's ca n't do that for Crysis , though . Changing brightness is easy , with four presets and one user changeable -LRB- I leave that at minimum brightness for at night -RRB- . The screen is a very pleasing matte , and the colors are great . You change it to 120 Hz in the advanced screen resolution settings in Windows 7 . 	Computer
Everything on this unit seems fine so far except for one item . Almost all new video cards have DVI only connection . This means that the vga connection will not work with my computers . I will have to find an adapter of some sort which is a pain as a cable should be sent with the unit in my honest opinin . 	Computer
I use this monitor exclusively for gaming . It 's hooked up via DVI-D to an nVidia GeForce FX 5950 card . I have nothing bad to say about the monitor 's performance - the games I play look spectacular with it . <p> I am used to a Sony Trinitron 19 '' CRT and now , when I look at the CRT alongside this Samsung LCD ? The CRT looks terrible : -RRB- <p> Best part of this Samsung LCD ? The blacks are REALLY black . When I use xterms the clarity of the text is out of this world . <p> If you can afford ~ $ 1200 , I really recommend this monitor to anyone . 	Computer

To start this product review I just want to say this monitor is amazing . I normally would n't say that about a product but I was blown away by this product , though I should have expected nothing less from ViewSonic . The screen size of this product is just about 22 inches measured diagonally or from the top left to the bottom right of the screen . This makes for the perfect size monitor to have on a desk or possibly mounted in a kitchen or on a small patio . It is extremely thin measuring about 16 inches high using the included base and about 21 inches wide . The TV is very thin and has VESA , standard used in wall bracket , screw holes so that it can be wall mounted . It is the normal 16:9 widescreen ratio that is seen on most widescreen TVs currently in retail stores . It is a LED LCD -LRB- Light Emitting Diode Liquid Crystal Display -RRB- or in simple terms super thin display with really good contrast ratio and clarity . In fact the contrast ratio of this display is 10,000,000:1 which means there are 10,000,000 shades from the darkest black to the brightest white -LRB- Be sure to adjust the setting on the display to allow for the dynamic contrast ratio . Non-LED displays range from just 1,000:1 to 100,000:1 . This makes a huge difference when watching movies that are displayed in the dark . Though the quality of the video has to be able to support the different shades which unfortunately seems hard to find , unless watching a Blu-ray . I personally stream HD videos off of Netflix and the quality of the video does n't do the monitor justice . The resolution is 1920 x 1080 or Full HD . This means that the monitor has the ability to produce video quality up to 1080P which is the highest quality video currently being used on both the Playstation 3 and Xbox 360 . As stated previously this is a monitor not a TV , meaning there is no tuner inside . That being said there are two input channels to select from so you can have two devices connected at a time . For example , I use this as my monitor for both my PC and Mac with each using one of the inputs . Other devices that could possibly be connected to this are Xbox 360 , Playstation 3 , HD DVR , Blu-ray Player , or any other device that contains an DVI\/HDMI1 output or VGA output . The audio is limited on this display seeing that it only has a single 3.5 mm jack , headphone jack . This being said there are other ways to produce better audio such as computer speakers or surround sound system . Depending on your situation this may be a deciding factor for you . I personally am satisfied with the audio though at times it does seem a little soft . Overall this product is an excellent bargain and should exceed most expectations . The price point of this product at time of post is around $ 170.00 on Amazon.com . After spending multiple hours looking for a new monitor that would n't break the bank I found this one and have been completely satisfied . This product is a MUST BUY whether it be a gift for someone else or a treat for yourself . 1HDMI input would require a DVI to HDMI cable in order to convert the input . In doing this sound will not be outputted through the monitor . -LRB- ... -RRB- 	Computer
The operation with the increased memory option was flawless with the Windows 7 Home Professional instaled otherwise other netbooks with Windows 7 Starter doesnt allow , and nobody mention this . This is a plus with this netbook , the increased size of 1.6 inches means better and clear view of webpages and woks made in Office . 	Computer
It was great to now that I could get such comprehensive protection for my new Macbook . The great thing I was able to get it 50 bucks cheaper on Amazon . However , I do feel that calling it a 3 year protection plan is very misleading in that it counts the 1st year of ownership in the 3 years . Therefore , it is actually a two year extended warrenty , go figure ? . I still do n't get it , but its still worth it to get the coverage due to the fact that anything and everything does happen to these delicate electronics . 	Computer
If any company could build a consumer tablet and do it right , that company is Sony . The S1 is an Android tablet done right . Build quality is first-rate . The angled -LRB- book-like -RRB- design of the S1 is cleaver and functional . The screen -LRB- with its deep blacks -RRB- is outstanding . The tablet is very comfortable to hold and carry . I 've only had the tablet for a few hours , but I am very impressed . Setup out of the box was simple . After an initial charge , I was up and running in no time at all . I was a little surprised that Sony did n't include any documentation -LRB- other than a Quick Start sheet , and the usual warranty and end-user license agreement -RRB- , but documentation was n't really needed ... and it is available on-line if necessary . Amazon -- thank you . You promised quick delivery and , as usual , you came through . I 'll update this review as I continue to explore the device , but if you are looking for a first-rate Android tablet , consider the Sony S1 -- you wo n't be disappointed . 	Computer
Just to keep it short : Excellent quality Excellent price -LRB- I 've seen it for quite a bit more at local stores -RRB- <p> The only problem I 've had is when viewing something full-screen , there 's a bit of distortion . But that 's probably something I 'm doing wrong , since the screen is absolutely perfect in all other settings . <p> So much quieter and smaller than my old 19 '' CRT monitor . <p> Highly recommended .

I purchased the PA246Q monitor in June 2011 after reading mostly favorable reviews . I use the monitor for photo & video editing and general computing . My son loves it for gaming . It is one of three monitors on my system and I drive it through the Display Port connection a high-end ATI graphics card . My monitor has not exhibited any dead pixels or other screen quality issues . Like most other reviewers , I too find that the monitor is too bright , so I adjust the brightness to the low end of the 1-100 scale . -LRB- Like setting it at `` 10 '' -RRB- . The monitor came with a color calibration report from the calibration done at the factory . I found that very little adjustment was needed once I did my own calibration . But I have had a consistent problem that has cost some troubleshooting hours before I learned how to avoid\/fix the issue . Sometimes , the Monitor will not `` Power-on '' . That is , after using the power button to turn it off -LRB- vs leave it in Standby -RRB- , I have had the unit refuse to turn back `` on '' . I have discovered that if I do n't turn the monitor `` on '' before I turn on the computer , I will not be able to turn on the monitor until I un-plug the DISPLAY PORT cable and power-cycle the monitor . Once I do this , the monitor will again turn `` on '' with a push of the power button . Then I can reconnect the DISPLAY PORT cable and all is well . I have not tested if this behavior occurs with other -LRB- DVI , HDMI -RRB- inputs , but if you experience a problem with getting this unit to turn `` on '' , try disconnecting your digital signal cable . My experience with ASUS Support is via email . They responded in 1.5 days -LRB- even on weekend -RRB- . The response on the power problem described above was adequate , with a couple of obvious suggestions , then some links to fill out a Return Material Authorization -LRB- RMA -RRB- form if indeed I needed to send it back . Now that I know how to prevent the problem , I have chosen not to send it back for repair -- everything else works great . The unit comes with a three year warranty , with one year on the IPS Screen . It is thicker than some LCD monitors , but that 's the price of the better IPS screen . Overall , if you 're looking for a good quality screen for photo processing or other work that requires accurate colors , you ca n't find a more cost-effective option right now . Oh - and the graphic screen overlays to put grids on the screen for accurate measurement of images on a page are very handy for work that is to be laid out on paper , or for cropping images to standard photo sizes . Conclusion : Good value for money if you look around for deals under $ 500 . Sometimes , you 'll see this unit for under $ 440 . Grab it when you do . You probably wo n't be sorry ! 	Computer
I have to put something in here . And it has to be long enough to make some buttons work . Twenty 	Computer
The vendor selling this now appears to be price gouging due to lack of availability . I got this from Amazon for 271 . This is a great little device for tooling around on the web . I love of . But it is not worth 400 dollars . Wait until Archos or Amazon has it back in stock . 	Computer
This was very nice on the second try . The first monitor developed a horizontal line after two hours of use . So I returned it for replacement . The replacement came two days later . It produces a bright , very sharp image . I wanted a monitor to occasionally use with my laptop . But since I hooked it up , I have hardly used my desktop computer at all . 	Computer
I read all the reviews before purchasing this product , and took the gamble that most people who decide to write reviews are driven to do so by a bad experience , and that not everyone who had a good experience posted a review . I owned the Archos 101 before purchasing this product , with the 16GB flash memory . At the time it was awesome compared to other tablets because of its file compatibility . It was a little slow , and at times non-responsive , but I could get past that because the USB port allowed me to use an external hard drive , meaning I was n't limited by the small internal memory . With this new one , I 'm not limited by a small memory , it 's touch screen and OS are significantly better , and I have full Play Store access , unlike the 101 . This means Netflix , etc. which is fantastic . It 's also a lot beefier than the 101 . Where the 101 was very light , and made of cheap plastic -LRB- I dropped it on the corner from about 6 inches up and the corner cracked -RRB- , this one does n't feel that way . I 'm sure if dropped it would react in a similar fashion , but it feels stronger . This is in large part due to the heavy hard drive inside it , but I do n't care where it comes from , I feel more confident carrying this around . I installed a firmware update yesterday , which I 'm sure had some bug fixes , but I have n't had time to check it out , so the problems are all prior to any update . The hard drive does run a little slower than flash memory , obviously , and this has only been noticeable when listening to music . If you go to skip a song , it takes 3-4 seconds to load the next one . Not too much of a problem . It does also have a problem with corrupted video files . Where a computer would just skip the frame or two that have issues , the Archos closes the video , meaning you have to reload the video and skip ahead to where the file is no longer corrupted . This is only an issue with anything that has been bit-torrented . I have had 3 instances of freezing in the 2 weeks I 've owned the device , but it takes so much less time to reboot than the old one that this is n't a problem for me . What was a problem was when I was on a plane over the weekend and the display became exceedingly bright . It was n't that the brightness was too high , it was that everything was distorted . This was only temporary , and I think was caused by low battery life . It was accompanied by bad behavior on the part of the battery , which drained from full to 15 % without any usage . This only happened the once , so I 'm assuming some sort of human error was involved . In terms of other complaints I 've heard about -LRB- specifically transferring files -RRB- , I think everyone is blowing it out of proportion . As long as you update to ICS before transferring any files you should not have any issues moving anything up to 15-20 GB at a time . I moved 4 seasons -LRB- 20 episodes per season -RRB- of a 30 minute TV show in one go , and had no trouble . That said , I tried to move 9 at once , and it stopped half way through . Part of this is because I told the computer to convert the files , and this just takes longer and keeps the hard drive running . I was n't concerned about checking up and moving more files every hour or two . I had nothing else to do . Others might care . It 's worth the wait for the end result . SIDE NOTE REGARDING CONVERSIONS : If you 're hooking this device up to Windows , WMP might ask you if you want to convert your files before transferring . If you get the cinema plug in -LRB- $ 10 on the Archos website , totally worth it -RRB- , this is unnecessary for most every file out there . I made the mistake of converting some of mine and it just doubles the time it takes to copy . There is no benefit to conversion unless you are unable to play the original file format . Overall I think this is an excellent device . I think that is clear based on the fact that it is one of only very few devices that Google lists as having Android 4.0 , and I think it runs it very well . Everything is very snappy , runs quickly , and looks fantastic . I 'd say for the money , there is no better option for a tablet of this size . The memory , the display , the size of the screen , the feel , and the UI make this a unique product . What makes it a fantastic product is the file compatibility . It plays all video formats -LRB- save a couple that I 've yet to come across -RRB- , has full Google Play store access , can accept third party applications , and runs everything with ease . These are all things that the vastly more expensive iPad can not say . The iPad also has 1\/4 the memory capacity at most . 	Computer
The Syncmaster 173S that I very recently purchased is doing fine . However I would n't know who to blame for the broken pixels , but most likely Samsung . The constant black dot and then the blue and red one I see every so often are a bit annoying , but supposedly most LCDs come with it . It 's too much of a pain to exchange it and demand for a new one or for it to be fixed , but that 's a personal preference . Overall though , the crispness and clarity is amazing and i 'm satisfied with that . I 'd prefer the neck to have more flexibility . Size is decent at this stage in technology ~ 	Computer
My P C Tablet came earlier than expected from Vostrostone . The unit works great and my hd videos play very smooth on it . The memory storage on this unit is 32gb and the installed software takes 20 + gb . The expansion will take an additional 32gb . The only two concerns that I have with the tablet . First is the touchscreen is not as sensitive on the edges of the screen . Second is when you need to replace the batteries , they are only serviceable by dealer , Vostrostone is in China . You have to send the unit back to them . This is vary costly . The price to send the unit back for replacement batteries is $ 50.00 to $ 100.00 plus the cost of the batteries . Vostrostone has been very helpful in trying to resolve this issue . They are contacting the manufacture and get battery replacement instructions , along with a replacement battery for me . I think amazon should post dealer and country location on websight . This would be very helpful to customers 	Computer

As someone said to me the other day in looking at my monitor , `` That is the best looking display I have ever seen '' . <p> Jon 	Computer
This is by far the best tablet I 've ever seen . I could n't believe it existed or had been invented when I first saw it . I 'm surprised it has n't gotten more attention . The price might be a problem . Also , it 's a real computer so you 'll have to make some customizing decisions once you get it -LRB- for example , deciding on screen brightness control , choosing which virtual keyboard to use , and assigning flick gestures -RRB- . If you 're used to a toy-like device , it might be an extra annoyance to deal with that . In any case , the samsung slate is capable of everything I had wanted a slate computer to do including note taking , translating written notes into printed text , and running all MS Office products plus Photoshop and PDF editors . If you can afford the $ 1000 + price , it would make no sense to buy any other kind of tablet . I use it to wirelessly transmit HD signals to a tv and projector -LRB- WIDI included -RRB- , for interactive powerpoint presentations , for sketching images -LRB- pressure sensitive wacom pen included ! -RRB- , and essentially everything a full on Windows PC can do . The only things I can complain about are the 4-5 hour battery life and the slow rotation from horizontal to vertical . I guess the pinch to zoom is not quite as smooth as you 'd expect after using Apple products . These are n't really significant flaws considering everything else this computer does . It 's really a brilliant device . 	Computer
This Tablet does everything I need and more ! Email , enjoying photos and Skype are great . Perfect for the backpack or the coffee table . Easier than a laptop for the young or old . Recommend the Toshiba cover that doubles as a stand . 	Computer
I 'd been looking forward to move up from a 22 '' LCD monitor for a month or so and finally decided on this one . Once I had it set up and sitting on my desk , I became giddy with excitement . It really does look beautiful . Turned on , I was amazed at how bright and clear the Windows 7 login screen looked . I proceeded to calibrate the monitor with a Spyder 3 Express and it made a noticeable difference in the colors . Much better ! All I 've really gotten around to doing , so far , is playing Dead Space 2 . The game looks pretty great . Backlight bleed is n't an issue -- which is nice for games that have you running around in the dark ! I have to say , though , the little bit of ghosting I 'm experiencing is hanging in the back of my mind as I 'm playing it . I came from a 2ms monitor and this is probably why . I do n't think most people would get hung up on it like I have . Yes , unfortunately , there are more gripes . When using browsers or viewing any white screen , the viewing angle issue - will - become very noticeable , very quickly . I have the screen sitting as far back on my desk as I can get it and it 's still an issue . When people say 2-3 inches movement to your left or right makes a difference , they are n't lying . Also , I noticed another review stating that , once set below a certain level of brightness , the screen will start to flicker . It became apparent to me as I started calibration , starting around 75 brightness for me . As much as I wanted to dig this monitor -LRB- and I have in some way -RRB- , it just missed the mark for me . I 'm sure plenty of people would be ecstatic about owning this screen . I 'm just gonna have to keep looking around . I 'm in no hurry ! 	Computer
i use this monitor for cad , and after using other viewsonics , this one is pretty darn good . lines and text are all very sharp using the native resolution of 1280x1024 . i would have given it 5 stars if it was n't for one bright green dead pixel , and a more discrite one darker and off to the side . from reading other reviews , it seems to be common for this monitor 	Computer
I appreciate all the full of excitement reviews from folks who recently purchased their Toshiba Thrive and now after a week or two they want to share with the world how great this tablet is . I felt the same way when I purchased mine , many , many months ago . I did select the Thrive for the same very reasons as many of the excited reviewers did , namely for the `` control '' and `` accessibility '' . I did like the ports , the rest seemed to be on par . It was my first tablet , had no point of reference . Three months later I bought my wife the Transformer . Very soon started noticing the differences . Yes , it is true that Thrive has the ports , which I used . But everything else , the user experience -LRB- when you have a chance to compare to other tablets side by side -RRB- lags behind . First , the tablet is slow . When awaken , it takes up to 30 seconds for the icons to populate the screen . When trying to shift to the next screen I experience a visible delay . Applications take their precious time when launched . For the purpose of full disclosure , I periodically clean my memory and reboot the tablet every several days . Second , after the most recent update certain apps do not longer work . Even after removed and reinstalled , I am unable to make them work . I was offered refunds from the Play store for those apps as the developers knew of the problem . Keep in mind that I also have access to my wife 's Transformer . When I can put my hands on it , my preferred choice is the Transformer as it is much , much faster than the Thrive . The same apps that do not work on Thrive , work perfectly on the Transformer . Maybe the reason why is that the Thrive is still on Honeycomb 3.2 where the Transformer is on the Ice Cream Sandwich 4.0 . That brings the issue of manufacturer support . The technology is changing very fast these days and what was hot six months ago , today is a yesterday 's toy . Toshiba seems to be busy producing newer tablets with more advanced version of the operating system , while the Thrive is still on 3.2 . Before you jump the ship and decide to go with the Thrive , check the Thrive users forums to see how many users feel neglected by Toshiba and swear not to buy another Toshiba tablet . Count me in , I need a product that is fully and actively supported by the manufacturer so it can keep up with the times . I would not recommend this product . 	Computer
For all the reasons given in the 5 star reviews , I am very pleased . I am totally new to tablets and the android system having always been using your typical Windows pc . I must say that I am getting used to Honeycomb OS . Very simply , this tablet works for me . As for the issue of the sleep mode , it happened to me once AFTER I installed the wifi timeout app as many said that would help the problem . Well only after I uninstalled that app did my tablet function normally AGAIN ! I also want to add that the suggestion of turning off wifi by selecting no wifi when screen is off AND turning off notifications by clicking on the time in the lower righthand corner then putting the tablet to sleep manually , that is , do not wait for the timeout you have set , seems to work like a charm . Toshiba , I have read , knows about this issue and will address it in some kind of software update as it seems to have something to do with the new version of the Honeycomb OS . While I have also read that some people are quick to bash this tablet and bring\/send it back for some other one , patience is needed as with the release of any new product . The features and performance of the Thrive are excellent as far as I have had it for 5 days . Give it a chance folks and do n't be nasty in your comments to those who like this tablet and are patient for what is not a major problem . No electronic device is without some glitchs ! 	Computer
It is a excellent Netbook , works very well , I like the keyboard and the performance is sufficient enough to my expectations . If I were able to change something in the design I definitely would change the way as battery assemblage to the machine . It is very inconvenient for a device designed to be carried . The battery seems like it were apart of the computer and occupies an extra space and then it is going again the compact design . However I have given 5 starts to the Netbook because this small issue is well observed when you see the purchase item in Amazon pictures -LRB- no hidden -RRB- and definitely is not against the overall excellent quality of it ... I have n't used the Notebook very much yet , so maybe in the future I can offer more detailed impressions ... 	Computer
I bought this monitor as an addition to my existing desktop monitor . The images are vivid and crisp , the text and fonts are very clear . Absolutely love it and cant beat the price ! 	Computer
Bottom line : If you are looking for an ultraportable computer , get this one . Worth every penny and then some . The 2010 MacBook Air gets serious about the ultraportable concepts introduced in the first MBA . The most important change is the 11.6 '' screen , representing just about the smallest possible form-factor without compromise to the keyboard . The screen is also right at the sweet spot , with a true 16:9 resolution and more pixels than the old 13 '' screens . I generally find it to be equally viewable as my desktop 's 20 '' , and bright enough even at 1\/2 brightness for most circumstances . This computer is anything but a netbook . Do n't call it a netbook . The MBA is a full computer that just happens to be ultra portable . The size and thinness really is all it 's cracked up to be . At 2.2 pounds , it 's lighter than most netbooks and actually lighter than any of the actual books I carry . It 's thinner than most paperback books . It takes up less space in my backpack than the printout of my course outlines . In fact , its overall volume is actually smaller than that of the floppy drive in my first computer , and I owned at least one cell phone that was heavier . When I take breaks from class , I usually hide it underneath a textbook , and you ca n't tell it 's there . Battery life is great and consistently exceeds my Macbook although not as good as some of the new Pros . I frequently get through six hours of actual work between charges , keeping Bluetooth turned off and brightness around 50 % . I moved to my MBA from my aluminum Macbook , which has since become my desktop computer . I have installed Office 2008 and 2011 , which actually run better on the Air than on the more powerful Macbook , due to the fast SSD . It really is faster than other laptops in several ways . When resuming from suspend by opening the cover , it is ready very quickly , including reconnecting to wireless . Booting from shutdown is incredibly fast , usually 4x faster than my other Mac . Opening files is fairly quick , although MS Office itself is a very slow program no matter what hardware you run it on . iPhoto is surprisingly snappy , but limited by hard drive size . The only areas where I 've noticed a performance issue are in very processor-intensive tasks like video conversion , although on those tasks it still outperformed my high-end 2006 model . This machine is not built to be a powerhouse , but it holds its own very well , especially when compared against similarly sized units. , many of which have single core chips . Remote Disc works well , but not as well as I 'd like . I recommend using it to copy the disk onto a local file , rather than actually running even an installer program off the remote disk . If optical discs are a frequent need , invest the $ 79 in the external drive . It works very well , and still keeps the overall weight well below that of a `` regular '' laptop . Basically the performance of this laptop is fairly impressive despite not setting any records . It shines in portability , and is more than adequate in most other areas . Some strange weaknesses versus some other Macs : - no backlit keyboard - no ambient light sensor - no sudden motion sensor -LRB- not needed because no HDD , but still fun in third party software -RRB- On the whole , this really is one of the best laptops that Apple or anyone else has ever made . Get one . 	Computer
This is a awesome LCD display , especially for the price . Easy to hook up and program . Have n't seen one around with the 10k pot included with , pretty sweet . 	Computer
I bought this screen manily because it would double a a TV , but I was pleasantly surprised to find that it is actually the best flatscreen monitor I have ever used -LRB- and I have used some ... -RRB- . The monitor worked right out of the box on my WinXP system , The TV worked right away as well , and the quality is fine at the distance I use it , which is about 10 ft. . Highly recommended .

Use on eof these at work . Woudlnt buy this if it was half the price . Picture is grainy regardless of setting and case is cheap plastic . this model is without any real quality components . Avoid HP products in general . Poor workmanship ! 	Computer
I purchased my L7EH monitor from COMPUSA . When I first connected it there were 3 dead pixels -LRB- below the count for RMA -RRB- . It was n't as bright as the CRT I replaced but we got used to this relatively quickly . Last week the monitor starting to shut down about 30 seconds after the PC was booted . Every time I had to turn it off and back on again . This would still only work for about 30 seconds . I put the CRT back on and everything was fine . I tried the flat monitor on another PC and the same thing happed . I called KOGi support and the first thing they asked me was what AC adapter I was using . When I told them , they said it could be 1 of 2 possible lighting problems . 1 was still under warranty and the other was n't . They told me there was no way to tell what was the problem unless I sent them the monitor . If the failing part was n't covered under the warranty the cost to fix would be $ 370 . After I stopped laughing I politely asked them about returns on this monitor and what was the breakdown of warranty vs. non-warrany repairs . At this point the conversation headed south quickly . They told me they did n't have that kind of information available . I liked the LCD monitor for all the space it freed up on my desk -LRB- more room for other clutter -RRB- . This was my first LCD flat monitor and I will be buying another rather than roll the dice with KOGi and their repair policies . 	Computer
Add me to the list of people who have encountered the dreaded `` H07 '' error . The unit is slightly over a year old and was lightly used . -LRB- about 2-4 times a month -RRB- Last week , I powered up the unit , put a DVD in , and up comes the error message on the display . THANKFULLY , I was wise and purchased the 3 year extended warranty . Why ? Because my last DVD player , also a Panasonic -LRB- DVD A120 -RRB- , suffered from the infamous laser pickup failure . This is the second machine I 've owned that 's went bad on me , and although my unit was repaired , I will no longer consider another Panasonic product . Over the years , I 've been a faithful customer of Panasonic\/Technics , but since around 2000 or so , they have had some serious quality control issues with their products that prevents me from recommending them as a first choice . Although their TV line is still acceptable , I 'd be hesitant to recommend any other Panasonic product . This is inexcusable why these things are suffering from major failures when they are still rather new . Whatever happened to the days when something would last 10-15 years and seldomly -LRB- if ever -RRB- needed repairs ? Are all companies designing products with a short lifespan now ? This is nonsense . I have an old AM\/FM console stereo with turntable and 8-track that is STILL working fine after nearly 30 + years of weekly use . What 's going on ? It seems to me that in the electronics field , anything over 3 years old is considered antique , so why not buy a new one since the cost of repairs will likely exceed what the product is worth ??? Come on Panasonic , get your act together ! We 're not talking about mass-market junk here , we 're talking brand name products from -LRB- once -RRB- reputable companies . In the past five years alone , I have replaced the following , -LRB- all within 3 years old -RRB- : <p> Zenith TV after two years -LRB- bad picture tube -RRB- Panasonic DVD -LRB- laser pickup failure -RRB- RCA CD changer -LRB- general failure -RRB- Sony Discman -LRB- motor failure -RRB- Technics Receiver -LRB- general failure -RRB- <p> Teac Single-CD player -LRB- laser failure -RRB- Zenith VCR -LRB- piece of junk that never worked right -RRB- JVC double cassette deck -LRB- unrepairable problem -RRB- Pioneer Amplifier -LRB- circuit board failure -RRB- <p> I 'm getting sick of having to go out and buy new A\/V equipment almost every other year . No sooner would I get something paid off , then something else would go on me . Maybe I 've just had bad luck , but reading all these other reviews , as well as reviews from other makes\/models , really makes me wonder just what is going on . Are they ALL producing junk now ? First it was the dreaded laser failure on Panasonic DVD players , now it seems they are having issues with the tiny DC motor that spins the stupid disc . Oh sure , I called their 1-800 number , but after spending almost 45 minutes on hold and getting bounced around the switchboard between customer service and their technician , I hung up . It was painfully obvious to me that nobody had a clue what I was even talking about . Took it into an authorized service center , and the guy smiled and yelled out to the back room : `` another Panasonic player on the fritz '' , which leads me to believe that the place must have been FULL of these things . It took nearly a month to get it back , and although Panasonic agreed to honor the warranty , they said that next time they would n't pay for it , and to just go out and buy another player . -LRB- which is exactly what they want you to do -RRB- Apparently , the life expectancy of these things is only 2-3 YEARS ? Come on !!! As for me , I learned my lesson the hard way . From now on , I 'm not going to purchase anymore `` quality , brand-name '' products , since they do n't seem to hold up any longer than the mass-market Wal-Mart junk does . Buyer beware . 	DVDPlayer
After three of us could finally figure out how to get the tv set up , it worked perfectly . However , after two days , whenever it was turned on for a few seconds it let out a loud roar that would not stop . I notified the seller who indicated that there had never been that kind of a problem , so I said , send me a postage paid sticker and I 'll just exchange it . Should n't have done that . The second one arrived and it appeared to be a used boom box - marred on the top . And , the remote would not work . Tried changing batteries and it still would n't work . Too bad , because it was exactly the type of product I was looking for . 	DVDPlayer
This product comes just as advertised . It is sturdy , has excellent padding to protect your device , and ample straps to make various adjustments . It even has room to store extra cords\/wires and a couple DVD 's as well . 	DVDPlayer
I purchased this to use primarily with my mp3 player although the other features looked attractive also . I read all the other reviews & understood that reception might be a problem as i live in a somewhat large metro area . . Memphis , TN , but decided to make the purchase just to test out the product . The GSI transmitter was put together well & all the controls & features were easy to figure out . It 's not a bad product , but I could not find a station that offered static free reception . If parked in one spot it worked fine , but while driving it did n't take long to get static & have to find another station , also the volumn controls had to be turned up substantially . It may work for you , but I 've resorted back to ear buds . 	DVDPlayer
The remote did n't work . I had to wait more than a week for a second remote . It worked , but the door open button did n't work . On at least two of every three DVD 's watched , the screen would freeze at some point . I 'd have to eject and start over . Last week it would n't even power on , so I shipped it back . I 'd be surprised if I ever get the reimbursement promised . 	DVDPlayer
Well from reading the other reviews I can only add the same ole same ole . Purchased in Nov 2003 worked pretty well until 2 months ago . Seems like we are reaching the max use range on this product . Disk errors started cropping up , would not read the disk it just wrote too etc. etc. . I just got word from the repair store today and the laser lens is shot and $ 350 to repair , needless to say what my decision was . Less than 3 years of use and now I have a VERY expensive DVD player . -LRB- while that lasts but who knows for how long -RRB- . Customer `` no service '' at Philips could seem to care less . They spend 10 minutes getting your personal information and 3 minutes on diagnosis . All in all I ca n't recommend the machine or the company . I may make the same mistake on a different manufacturer or model but I wo n't make it again on a Philips product . 	DVDPlayer
I bought it last week . This DVD player works great ! 	DVDPlayer

I finally decided to purchase this DVD player after searching many other DVD players . I needed a region free one for me to watch DVD from Japan . Except the fact shipping and handling was little bit expensive and it didn ' t have good tracking system , the item FINALLY arrived and just little bit confusion , I was able to change the setting to region free . It has been working good ever since . I would recommend this items to everyone who is needing region free DVD player . 	DVDPlayer
I 've been wanting to get a portable dvd player for a long time and with an upcoming 13 + hour flight from Boston to Alaska , I decided to take the plunge . -LRB- ... -RRB- To my surprise , the little Panasonic LS5 player with 5 '' widescreen display was a standout ! The Panasonic LS5 has a bright , clear picture which even I , who need glasses for close work , could see just fine . The coolest part about the monitor is that you can adjust the angle of viewing just by popping the LCD forward -LRB- as shown in the picture of this player on Amazon -RRB- . The screen can fold down almost flat on top of the player so it takes up even less space . The whole player , even with the battery attached , is really small - perfect for travel . This does not come with a car adaptor , but I found an extra battery , CGR-H601 , with about a 4 hour playtime -LRB- I actually watched two dvds on a recent flight and did not run out of power -RRB- , online for $ 49.00 . That 's a lot cheaper than the car power adaptor . You 'll also need an earphone splitter -LRB- they are very inexpensive -RRB- if you want to watch using earphones with a friend as there is only on earphone plug . -LRB- ... -RRB- This really is a great little portable dvd player .

My old Panasonic blu-ray player delivered an excellent picture but the slow load time drove me crazy . This one loads very quickly and also delivers an excellent picture plus great digital sound -- the separation is astounding . I often find myself looking over to my left or right when the sound is in the movie . Setting up the Netflix streaming was confusing but I called Panasonic and they walked me through it step by step . Netflix HD movies look great and there is no pausing while the signal catches up . I do n't have a 3D tv but it 's nice to know that the blu-ray player can handle one if I should choose to buy one in the future . Panasonic did a great job on this one . 	DVDPlayer
This sounds like other reviews on Amazon.com . After about six months of use , my recorder started losing the ability to recognize commercial DVDs . Then , it locked up while dubbing from HD to DVD-R , went into Recover , and made the disk useless -- at $ 1.50 or so a pop . Then , it stopped working altogether . The repair place that Panasonic sent me to said that they could n't get a new `` deck '' from Panasonic for about six weeks . I called Panasonic , got the part expedited , but , when the repair part was installed weeks later it turned out to be defective . That was weeks ago . New repair parts are still weeks out . The parts guy at the repair place told me that these things break constantly , specifically that they were released to the market before the technology was right . So , the Panasonic DMRs are piling up at the shop . It takes a long time to talk to someone at Panasonic -LRB- I 'm on hold now and have been for about 20 minutes -RRB- . The people I 've talked to are nice but refuse to connect me to anyone above them and essentially are not permitted to do more than pass on the problem to their bosses . The most recent one even said this was my fault because I did n't call every few days to see if they had done anything about the part . When I told him that this was corporate responsibility , he just got evasive and continued to make it my fault . So , if you buy this , expect it to break , expect that there are no parts , expect to get the run around . I paid a lot of money for something that does n't work and ca n't be fixed .

I purchased this DVD player for my teenager 's room . I wanted something that was not really expensive , but would run DVDs 24\/7 . -LRB- I can not tell you how many times I have woken up in the middle of the night to find the DVD player still running without anyone watching it . -RRB- The only feature that it does n't have that I wish it did have is an automatic screensaver when the DVD is at the main menu and no one has made any selections -LRB- see above for reason -RRB- . Other than that , this is a perfect no-frills DVD player . 	DVDPlayer
I have had this product only 1 month . The features were why I purchased this item & I have not been disappointed with that . However , multiple segments on the function display did not illuminate . This was a gift for my son & the hassle of repackaging , returning to vendor , waiting for a replacement made an exchange non-desirable . In this case , buying the product from a store rather than over the net would be my recommendation . 	DVDPlayer
I bought this system for immediate heavy use . We were going on a roadtrip to Disney , then flying from Germany to the states and back , as well as a lot of driving in between . I did n't want to prematurely review this item , but I feel that the hours of use we have put it through give me a pretty good idea about its overall performance . Let 's start with the drawbacks since most people look for those first when considering a new purchase . Cons : - Mounting straps are difficult to get on . Not impossible , but not easy . Once you have untangled them and attached them to the units themselves , they are much easier to work with . The initial set-up is a bit more difficult . They do hold the units securely to the headrest , so I ca n't complain , but they did n't feel as sturdy as I would have liked . - Second unit has to be plugged in to work . This fact itself is n't a problem for me . But , the way they did it is so weird . The main unit has an internal battery that will only power the main unit . Fine . But , if you want to use both , you plug a car adapter into the main unit , then connect a power cord -LRB- and A\/V cable -RRB- from the main to the second . I think it 's also supplying the main unit with power so that the battery is n't drained , but it was quite a hassle figuring out which unit had to go where because of the power cord . -LRB- I should note , this was only a problem because our main car adapter port was in use by the GPS , so we needed to use one in the back -RRB- - The cable that connects the 2 units has to be inserted completely to work . Sounds like a no brainer , but the A\/V cable sometimes feels like it 's all the way in , but may not be . Another reviewer complained about how their second screen would only display `` AV IN '' and this is why . It happened to us the first time we tried to use it and it just turned out that the cable was n't all the way in . - When using a USB stick , the unit takes FOREVER to recognize it . This is my single biggest complaint about the unit . We have to tell it to read the DVD even though there is n't a DVD to read . Then it usually -LRB- but not always -RRB- notices the USB and lets us select that . When it does n't , we just repeat this until it does . If you use a SD card , it recognizes those instantly , so you should n't have this problem . It 's almost annoying enough to fork over money just to get a large SD card that can replace our USB stick . Almost . Pros : - Has an internal battery so you do n't have to be in the car to use it . And if you do stop for gas , or whatever , the main unit keeps playing ! -LRB- Those who complain that it turns off and has to restart must not have charged their batteries first -RRB- This was a real lifesaver when our van broke down in the middle of nowhere in France ! The internal battery does have to be charged by a standard adapter , not a car adapter , but for us that has never been a problem . - Has 2 screens so kids sitting in different rows of the car can still watch the same movie . They are n't huge screens , but my kids have yet to complain about not being able to see and that 's what matters . - Each screen also has a little fold-out stand so it can stand up on a table if you are not in the car . - Reads USB and SD cards . I 'll be honest , I have n't even tried to put a DVD in it . I did open it to take out the cardboard shipper , but that 's it . It 's SO convenient to have a USB stick with several movies on it and just let it play without having to change DVDs mid-trip . I 'm not normally one who likes to let the kids watch movie marathons , but on long car\/plane trips , I can make an exception . The massive downfall to this is that it is VERY difficult to rip DVDs onto the computer ! Before I get any comments from `` copyright nazi 's '' , I will say that I legally own a copy of every movie I ripped and it still took me an entire day to figure it out ! The player reads several formats , but I went with MP4 , mostly because it was the only one I could figure out . Oddly enough , I actually had to convert them from MP4 to MP4 , so make sure they are NOT H. 264 encrypted . - Comes with a carrying case , earbuds -LRB- not what I would call `` headphones '' -RRB- , all the cables you will need , and a remote control . We have n't used the earbuds or remote , but we have tested everything else . I really love that it came with a case ! It 's not fancy at all and does n't have any padding , but it 's the perfect size , has a handle for easy carrying , and it keeps everything together and out of sight of would-be robbers . Is this unit perfect ? No , but I do n't believe there is such a thing . Every person expects something different out of a travel DVD player system . This one is a great value for the money and I believe it was worth every penny ! Would I buy it again ? Absolutely !! If you can live with the cons I mentioned , then you wo n't be disappointed !

I have lots of films on my laptop . I used to connect the laptop to my flat screen tv to watch them , then I heard they have these DVD players that you can use a usb stick with video files on them to play on the tv ! I also rent foreign DVD 's from a great video place in town that I have n't been always been able to play on my laptop . The people at the video store said that I need to play them on a standalone Dvd player . I researched a bit , saw that this one had the best reviews overall for low end players with usb . I only wanted to spend $ 50 or so but mainly I wanted it to work with the usb stick . Great news ... it works . Occasionally a video file from my laptop will be in a `` codec '' -LRB- basically a type of file -RRB- that is not supported by the DVD player . This happens about 1 out of 25 times . When I stick with AVI files they work fine . I was a little suprised by how light the player is , but it 's also very slim and fits into a narrow slot under the tv . I 've had it for 6 months or so and used it almost every day . The image is great . One setting that I 'm glad I finally found was the sleep setting . Basically if you pause the video and leave it paused for more than ten minutes or so , it 's automatically set to turn off . When you turn it back on , you have to manually fast forward to the spot you paused it before . I guess this saves energy . It 's annoying , but you can change the setting so it does n't do that , or at least not for a few hours . This is key if you 're like me and constantly pausing to do other things -LRB- like write this review -RRB- . There may be nicer ones out there but if you 're not looking for bells and whistles , this is a great value . I would not hesitate to buy this again . 	DVDPlayer

This was my second attempt at trying the Sony DVP FX750 . Our last one performed fine , then one day the input for the power cords collapsed into the unit , just disappeared inside . That was after , maybe 25-30 hours of use . We tried again , because we were hoping that was just bad luck . However , this unit started giving us trouble pretty much out of the box . The movies would just freeze , if you smacked the door , you could sometimes get the movie going again , only to have it freeze moments later . Do n't bother , it looks good , it feels well made , sleek , heavy etc. . Those are red herrings , poor quality manufacturing . Time to put all our movies on an iPad ? 	DVDPlayer
I purchased this DVD player for my daughter for airline flights . We currently own the Panasonic DVD-LS5 and decided to upgrade to a 12 inch model . The problem is that my 17 month old daughter can only sit still watching a show called Boohbah and does n't like watching it on the 5 '' monitor . We noticed when running it on our 15 '' laptop , she was fine . So , we got the 12 inch model . When I put in the DVD , the picture is was way to bright and straining on the eyes . All other DVD 's look great but when it comes to certain movies with bright colors , the colors are exaggerated like stated in another review . `` The picture quality suffers from bad black level . Imagine watching a movie that takes place in darkness and instead of the night being black it 's gray . I tested a couple of CGI animation and it looked too bright that everything looked washed out . Significant lost of detail was obviously lost in bright scenes . Picture adjustments did n't work too well . Low light settings were way too low that a lot of detail in the picture was lost . Inside light settings provided the picture more sharpness and brightness but edges were exaggerated . Outside settings provided more color to the picture but looked unnatural . Standard was the best picture it provided . '' All in all , it 's a great player . Just ca n't watch movies with bright features . 	DVDPlayer
The Coby TF-DVD7107 potable DVD player is a very good value . The player comes with earphones and connector to both a regular outlet and the 12 volts car outlet . I have only had the player about a month , but I am very satisfied with it . The player easily holds a charge for the duration of a movie , the picture quality is good and it never skips . There are a few nits . It only display widescreen format and when I use it to display my photos from a cd they get distorted . The speakers are not great , and the batteries for the remote control did not work when I recieved the player . But who needs the remote anyway for a player that is meant to be used within arms length . In spite of the minor flaws it derserves 5 stars considering its price\/value . 	DVDPlayer
Stalls movies intermittenly . Can not play my foreign dvd . Makes some noise . Picture quality and optical output are good when it works , of course . 	DVDPlayer
I got this hoping to replace my DVD\/Karaoke player AND Audio Receiver and ended up with worthless piece of junk . The surround sound did n't work no matter what setting I tried in the setup ... the front speakers would not do sound . I had to connect it to my audio receiver . The DVD function of it kept freezing up and the sound kept cutting out . Otherwise , I may have kept it to connect to my audio receiver in place of my other DVD player . But , it still was n't worth keeping ... even with the very low price . Guess I got what I paid for ! 	DVDPlayer
This machine is solid , performs well , and very easy to use . I highly recommend if you 're sick of spending hundreds of dollars on equipment that seems as if it was made in a toy factory . 	DVDPlayer
This truly is one of the best Bluray players on the market . The picture quality is outstanding , easy to use interface , I ca n't believe how quickly the disc loads . You ca n't go wrong . This will last me years and years 	DVDPlayer
My DVD711 was used a grand total of 4 times when the laser reader died . After writing of my experience to Philips , they pretty much told me they were very sorry . Sorry does n't walk the dog . BEWARE buying any Philips product becasue they obviously do n't stand behind their work . Add this to the fact that they 're pricey compared to other brands and there is no reason whatsoever to choose Philips . 	DVDPlayer
Do not waste your time buying this DVD player !!! I am serious !!! I 've had this thing for couple of months and now it just wont work . I guess you get what you pay for !!! The screen is jumping up and down and there is no more color . I have tried everything and it still doesnt work !!! What a piece of junk and waste of money !!! Do not waste your money on Coby products !!! They seem promising at first but then couple months later doesnt even work !!! ... Dont even think twice about this product !!! 	DVDPlayer
I bought this to replace a cranky old Sony which refused to play DVD+R and had a hard time with mass copied DVDs . The Panasonic does okay with home burned DVDs , but chokes on marginal quality commercial DVDs . The showstopper : A lot of the time , I watch part of a DVD , then turn the unit off and return to finish later . This unit will not automatically remember where you were in the disc - you have to press a cleverly hidden button on the remote - and it 's a button which no universal remote I have can duplicate . So the drill is to put down the universal remote , find the Panasonic remote , find the magic key , press it , then use the universal remote to power off the DVD\/TV\/audio system . If you do n't hit the magic button , the DVD will play from the beginning . Pain in the butt . 	DVDPlayer
What a disapointment ! Love the idea of the Karaoke . Ran out and brought Karaoke disc 's and microphone only to be totally let down . No graphics on screen . Volume teribble ! Three days after that the DVD player would not work start playing a movie all of a sudden it just paused , now all we get is black & white pictures and constant rolling of the picture . Tried all the instructions from the troubleshooting guide still nothing ! of course all this happens after the warranty is up ! 	DVDPlayer
I have been looking for something like this for a long time . I think this is the best ever , and the price was great . I have a boy 7 and a girl 4 neither wants to watch the same movie . I will say they need help to work them , but the fact that they can watch different movies and wear headphones is a plus . I am able to do everything from the front seat while my husband drives . My son is getting better at working them . If you leave them pluged into a power source they play back from wear you left off . They are easy to remove and place under a seat if you go into a store or someplace . My kids love them the sound is great and the picutre is great . We use them to go on trips and the fact that they can use them in a hotel room to is wonderful . I would recomend them . hope my review is helpful . 	DVDPlayer
Yes , it is region free . Yes , good price . Yes , has a remote . Yes , has a few extra functions . But , that 's where it ended for me . I am on my second Cyberhome . The first one stopped working after 3 months . The red light would come on but would n't turn on nor would it open up . So I thought I got a defective one . Brought it to my local electronic store and it cost more to fix it ! So I plopped down another $ 35 and bought another one . Same thing , this time , it lasted 4 months . I played both approx two times a week . I did n't move it after I set it up nor did I drop it . My sister has one too so maybe it 's just mines . She has dificulty getting it to turn on too but after she unplugs it and plugs it back in , it works fine . I 'm still searching for a low priced dvd player for my den but so far I 'm temporarly sticking to my Sony and Panasonic . For the price , it is the majority of why I gave it a big 3 stars . And for basic easy to read functions . For function or longevity , I give it a zero . If Cyberhome comes out with a new model , I have to say that I will be REALLy tempted to try it for the price . Four months may be worth it . Next time I 'll prob repair mines . Where else can you buy a dvd player for this cheap ??? 	DVDPlayer
This DVD player is the pitts ! I have replaced it on 3 different occasions and it breaks with in 30-45 days . I will not replace it again . Before it broke it would load S-L-O-W ... save youself the hassle pay 50.00 more and avoid the frustration , Unless you prefer frustration then by all means Buy Mintek ! 	DVDPlayer
This is a great DVD player if you do n't mind that the car adapter will not stay plugged in . It loses power constantly ! Then my 10 month old 's video cuts off ... which means mom has to restart or ff back to where she left off . It is awful !!! I have tried the car adapter in a Lexus , Ford , Mazda , Pontiac and Mercedes . . -LRB- we travel a lot -RRB- The plug worked the same in all of them . I would not recommend this DVD , and if I could return it I would !!!! 	DVDPlayer
We just spent six months living in Japan and purchased several DVDs while there , but ca n't play them on our DVD player here , so we purchased this All Region DVD player . Beware , you MUST follow these instructions to make it region free -LRB- the user manual clearly states that it will only play region 1 DVDs , but if you enter code below , it will play all -RRB- . 1 . No DVD in the tray . The tray closed . The unit and TV on . 2 . Press `` Setup '' on the remote . 3 . Press the `` down '' arrow repeatedly until the top heading shows `` Preferences . '' 4a . Then press `` OK '' and Audio will be highlighted . b. Press the `` down '' arrow and the next category `` Subtitles '' will be highlighted . c. THEN enter this 6-digit code : `` 138931 '' Immediately the screen will show `` Region Code 1 '' . d. Press the `` up '' arrow and `` Code 1 '' becomes `` Code 0 '' . All Region or Region Free . e. Press `` Setup '' to exit . 5 . Turn off and then back on to remove green bar along the top of the screen Thanks to other reviewer who posted these instructions ! 	DVDPlayer
I have a 32 '' letterbox Toshiba TV -LRB- NOT high definition -RRB- . I put in a DVD and then used the zoom to fill the tv screen . The picture quality degraded very badly . Be clear , it was not a minor amount . The faces became blurred and the colors turned to mush . I tried everything in the manual to correct the problem . I tried the same test on my old Philips DVD player and the picture only degraded a minor amount . I am not recommending Philips because it has a hard time with episode DVD 's , remote is bad news , and loading is forever . <p> I am not a picky detailed person . If something works okay that is good enough . I do not expect perfection . <p> The remote on the Panasonic was okay and the DVD tray opened quickly . See , I found something good to say about the Panasonic . 	DVDPlayer
If you 're like me and all you 've ever used is the buds that came with your player or ten dollar ones from Target , you need to get these . The sound is really great . They have very punchy bass , without sacrificing treble . The cord does not tangle easily . They have a clip on the cord to prevent the buds from pulling out . They come with a handy little bag to stash them in . The sound isolation is quite good as well . They 're not amazingly comfortable , because there 's this big piece of hard plastic just outside your ear canal , but even that complaint is a four star versus five star kind of thing in my mind so I 'm sticking with 5 stars given all the other good points .

HI THIS IS BILL AND I RECOMMEND THAT EVERY BODY BUY FROM COBY U.S.A. THIS IS THE 2ND ALL REGION PAL\/NTSC DVD PLAYER THAT I BOUGHT FROM THEM . JUST REMEBER TO CALL IN TO TEC SUPPORT AND GET THE CODES TO TURN ON `` ALL REGION '' DVD PLAYER . 	DVDPlayer
Like many of you , I 've read so many reviews I was afraid to buy ANY player . I just like to watch movies , and this player is spectacular .

The Zenith DVD216 has an excellent picture and the unit is atractive , but the remote is useless . On any input from the remote , there is a very , very slow response from the DVD . It takes forever to select a particular scene . I am sending back the unit for a replacement . It may be that this unit had a defective remote or a defective sensor eye on the DVD . Amazon is sending me a new unit . I will follow-up when the new unit arrives . Zenith Electronics Incorporated is useless . They do not have anyone on tech-support . Customer service at Zenith did not help either . They wanted me to fax them a copy of the bill , and then they would let me know what to do . Their fax machine was busy all day . Amazon was terrific . They are sending a new unit out today . It will arrive in 3 or 4 days . The defective unit will be picked up and shipped back for free . 	DVDPlayer
I 'm very happy with my new DVD Player . . , it allows me to playback burned DVD 's , multizone DVD 's , also I can download videos from the WWW , and burn it on a Video Cd -LRB- VCD -RRB- or Super Video Cd -LRB- SVCD -RRB- and it looks great . It also allow me to reproduce mp3 and audio CD 's while I 'm doing something else . It have a yummy screensaver that appear when you hold on the movie or while you listen to music . It also reproduce Cd 's with images ... , a great feature ... , cuz you can see with your friends and realtives your pictures . It allows you to rotate them , change the way they appear . It 's a great product ! I recommend it 101 % . E8A 	DVDPlayer
These are fine for cheap portable DVD players . I bought 3 of them and got 3 different power bricks . After a few days , one of them stopped working . I did the standard replacement procedure through Amazon and less than a week later , at no expense to myself -LRB- they sent a shipping call tag -RRB- , I had a new unit . 	DVDPlayer
This is one of the best deal DVD on market nowadays . With CD-R . CD-RW , MP3 compatibility and Progessive Scan , it has the same level with Panasonic RP-56 and Sony DVPNS700P . But it also has one more extra cool ability `` ZOOM '' . That 's the extra star is for . I just hate the remote . With its color -LRB- pale gray -RRB- it looks so cheap . It does not match the `` cool '' view of the player itself . It does matter to me , as the remote is the only part of the DVD that will always be near me whenever I watch the movie . 	DVDPlayer
I am trashing the DVG-9000N for one reason : the Daewoo DVG-9000N is advertised as having a VGA output and some of the DVG-9000N 's mysteriously do n't have the VGA capability . The Owners Manual for the DVG-9000N on Daewoo 's own web site describes the DVG-9000N as having a VGA output and shows an HD-15 plug on the back but the DVG-9000N delivered to me did not have VGA out or the HD-15 plug . Daewoo 's reps in New Jersey , though they were courteous and friendly and promptly returned my call , had no expanation for this feature deletion . Daewoo really ought to change model numbers or otherwise specify when it takes away a feature from a product so consumers will know what they are getting . 	DVDPlayer
I have read the many reviews of this DVD player , and I have to say that I have had no problems with installation , playing new DVDs and playing older dvds . The remote layout can be confusing , but once you get the hang of it , you should have no problem . I highly recommend this player for everybody 	DVDPlayer
This DVD Player is THE ABSOLUTE BEST in the price range offering tons of special efffect features . Many reports of `` skipping '' on this DVD player are true , but they have to do with the disc , not the player . Some DVD discs are recorded in a `` duel-layer '' format , causing a slight skip , once , at the same place on the disc every time . If the disc is recorded in this format it will say so in the fine print on the back of the cover . This `` skipping '' should also be prominant on other DVD players as well . 	DVDPlayer
I researched FM transmitters for my original iPhone on Amazon and found a lot of them to have very unfavorable reviews . So I looked for the one with the best reviews and it was the one from GSI . It worked easily and flawlessly right out of the box . The sound quality is good especially for fm quality . It does sound a little heavy on the bass for some reason , but that can be adjusted through your stereo equalizer or your iPhone equalizer . The docking mount is sturdy and charges your iPhone while also functioning as an fm transmitter . And it was only $ 14 while qualifying for Amazon free shipping . I would highly recommend this product . 	DVDPlayer
I bought this player for 50 $ + shipping . I expected 10 $ mail-in-rebate . I did n't get the rebate . I think the player worked well for about 3 or 4 months , As I used very rarely . Then When I started using it really , The small door for the slot , where we insert and remove DVD 's got jammed . It is very delicate . I opened and fixed the spring inside . But It got jammed again after 1 month . Now when I tried to open the door to insert to DVD , It will open and close immediatly . It will not stop in open condition . It is not worth of our time to buy cheap Player like this . Better to buy a good brand name player for almost same or little bit more price . Thanks , 	DVDPlayer
This item was pretty inexpensive , less than $ 100 , and everything was included . BUT , it is very cheap !!! I 've had it for a week , and the clip to the bag broke because it was only made out of cheap plastic . So , I can no longer use the strap to carry the bag . I called Audiovox to see if I could get another strap , and they said they no longer make that strap , wonder why ? Could it be that it broke too easily ? Than , today , my daughter was trying to put the head phone on her ear , and that broke in half . I could n't believe how easily it broke , but then , it was made out of thin plastic , too . Luckily , it came with two headphones , so now , I have to guard it like a hawk to make sure it does n't get damaged , too . If you get it , you need to be really careful with the parts . Oh , also , the dvd player makes a sound when it is on , a little noisy . Good luck !! 	DVDPlayer
This unit provides excellent A\/V output when you have HDTV and Digital Receiver . To achieve best out , you do need to read the menu including the fine prints .

My advertising agency is really booming and my wife and I are traveling out of state at least once each month . We fly everywhere we go and usually it is magazines and a book that passes our time . A friend told me about the Toshiba portable DVD player and so after some research I decided to buy it . The deciding factors for me were : one of the biggest screens in a portable and the fact that it had to external , headphone jacks . Most of the ones I read about had only one . Janie and I just flew from Dallas to Philadelphia and the flight seemed liked a blink due to the fact that we were enjoying a FREE movie . If you travel , you need to add this one to your TOY list . <p> Bill Russell 	DVDPlayer
I 'd heard a great deal of buzz about JVC 's new XV-S60BK DVD player - much of it revolving around the low list price and the anticipation that it would deliver artifact-free progressive-scan images . Buzz aside , the player looked unassuming enough when I removed it from its box . The sleek front panel has only the most essential control buttons , plus an indicator that lights when the player is set to its progressive-scan mode . <p> The back panel is equally streamlined but has all the usual outputs . The component-video jack is switched to progressive mode by pressing the Progressive Scan button on the remote and holding it for a few seconds . In a new and very welcome trend that saves you quite a few bucks , JVC packages a set of component-video cables with the player . <p> The JVC 's remote control felt substantial , with large buttons I could easily locate by touch in the dark . The controls you 'll use most often are on the lower half . Directly above them are buttons for less used functions like picture zoom and shrink , Digest -LRB- displays a grid of images from each chapter on a DVD -RRB- , and picture-quality presets . The remote can also be configured to control your TV . <p> Pressing the On Screen button near the bottom of the remote during playback shrinks the movie to a quarter-screen window and fills the rest of the screen with a control panel . Several functions can be accessed from this panel , including repeat modes , time and chapter search , and selection of soundtrack and subtitle language or camera angle . It also includes bar graphs indicating elapsed time and the disc 's data-transfer rate . When you 're playing a CD , a similar onscreen control window is available to set up repeat modes or program track order - if you do n't mind turning on the TV . <p> The JVC 's 2x fast-scan mode delivered smooth , fluid playback . Another neat feature is aspect ratio control , activated by selecting the 16:9 Normal setting in the setup menu . This will prove useful if you have a widescreen HDTV that locks into a 16:9 or `` full '' display mode when it receives a progressive-scan signal -LRB- a number of them do -RRB- . Set to its 16:9 Normal mode , the JVC player formats standard 4:3 images so they 'll appear on widescreen displays with correct geometry instead of being stretched out to fill the screen . <p> Like the Marantz changer , the JVC effortlessly sailed through my progressive-scan torture tests . Scenes with fine horizontal lines combined with moving cam erawork all came through without any artifacts . Colors , too , looked solid , with no combing visible in either the bright reds of Yellow Submarine or the catcher 's orange chest protector in For the Love of the Game . <p> When I switched to another reference DVD , the Hitchcock classic North by Northwest , I thought at first that the JVC came up somewhat shy on picture detail . Checking the sharpness control in the player 's Normal preset , however , I noted that it was a notch below maximum . Bumping it back up let me clearly see both the texture in Cary Grant 's impeccably cut gray suit and the details in the intricate furnishings of James Mason 's library . Setting sharpness to maximum added slight ringing artifacts to the lines in the resolution pattern of Ovation Software 's Avia test DVD , but I did n't notice any with movies . <p> The JVC XV-S60BK is an all-around excellent progressive-scan player that 's also very reasonably priced . Having finally gotten my hands on it , I can attest that it more than justifies the buzz . <p> Order yours now ! 	DVDPlayer
I bought it when the price was $ 370 and Amazon had $ 30 off $ 250 certificate . At that range , it simply creams everything else . Most others were about $ 100 more . Unlike most others , it plays - r , - rw and - ram formats -LRB- all panasonics or sonys do not -RRB- . Only catch is u have to be in the - r\/rw camp . Note that this will effect your future choice of dvd camcorders also -- so be careful . You want both - rw and - ram formats as you do not know which will win out . Only problem is that most TVs do not have a S-video OUT so you can not record higher resolution . Else , works as advertised provided you buy `` standard '' discs like Memorex etc -LRB- Compusa dvds did not work -RRB- . AFTER 5 months ... \*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\* The DVD will not often load - R discs -- even the discs it created ! It is a crap shoot -- sometimes , the same dvd will load and sometimes not ! The - r disc is the right version and this used to be great 3 months ago . A user in avforms suggested he opens\/cloese the drive and sometimes this solves the problem . The RAM and - rw discs load fine . Unfortunately , WARRANTY IS ONLY 90 DAYS FOR LABOR . Toshiba has discontinued the model . 	DVDPlayer
This is a quality DVD player that has great battery life . I can recommend this product for anyone who needs portability and viewability . 	DVDPlayer
This player is not region free , as some have claimed . It had trouble playing certain foreign and indie DVDs -LRB- not DVD-Rs , mind you -RRB- from day one . Some disks just would n't play at all , even though they played fine in other players . After 5 months -LRB- not long after the warranty ended -RRB- , the player completely crashed . Wo n't play anything now . If it does play , it stops after the 4th or 5th chaper - just freezes and has to be ejected and reloaded to even get the menu . Tried emailing the manufacturer and predictably they never answered . In short , this thing plays okay -LRB- and just okay -RRB- until the warranty is up . 	DVDPlayer
I never thought I would have made such a bad purchase when I bought my HK DVD 5 . The unit is in for repairs more than it is playing DVDs . The worse part is that practically no one in America is qualified to repair these things so you have to ship your unit half way across the US to get it fixed -LRB- at your expense -RRB- . Mine just stopped working for no reason at all . I eventually found out that the power supply went bad , after owning it for 14 months -LRB- the warranty was over -RRB- . Strictly from a warranty \/ repair viewpoint I will never buy HK again . I purchased a Panasonic DVD player while my HK DVD was in for repairs and I swear the picture is just as good if not better .

We almost bought the Sony S360 , but this one was cheaper and had zoom . Sony does not ! Bought it 2 months ago and have watched over 25 DVD 's so far . We had a couple of problems that were attributed to Blockbuster rentals . Never had any problems with new DVD 's . Started out using regular RCA plug for video and was severely disappointed . When I switched to S-Video , WOW !!! The picture is amazing ! The sound is great , also ! We love the zoom , ff , rew , pause features too ! Everything works great . We absolutely love it ! I highly recommend it ! 	DVDPlayer

We 've owned this unit for two years , and it was a workhorse during that time . But , like the other reviewers , I bought this player to last much longer than two years . Heck , I have a boombox that is 21 years old and still plays tapes and radio just fine , not to mention our 13-year-old VCR which shows no signs of slowing down . Oh , and our 13-year-old RCA TV set ... still looks great . <p> My point here is that Panasonic should offer some kind of refund to owners of this player . Two years of life is ridiculous in this day and age . 	DVDPlayer
Great product , i do n't regret buying it at all . However there are some annoying control related issues i could do without : \* Pressing the up arrow button will reset random setting . I like to randomize playing my songs and if you accidentally hit the up arrow instead of the >> button -LRB- to move to the next random song -RRB- , the random setting is lost\/reset . \* When in randomizing mode , the << button does n't move to the previous random song . \* When switching between input settings -LRB- AV input , to radio , to cd player -RRB- the cd player does n't stop . In other words , the cd continues to spin . For example , say i am listening to the cd player then i switch to the radio , i can still hear the cd spinning in the background because it 's still `` playing '' . I have to manually press stop before switching to the radio . And if i then happen to turn off the car and turn it back on , the cd player starts up and continues to `` play '' again even if i did press stop previously . Very annoying ! \* Maybe this issue is just related to my car . If i have my ignition turned off but have the car in `` idle '' to listen to the cd player . If i then turn the ignition back on , this unit will momentarily turn off then turn back on thereby interrupting whatever music i was listening to . Why does it do this ? My previous cd player never did this . I never turned the car off therefore the cd player should continue to play and the unit should n't `` blink '' . 	DVDPlayer
Worst DVD player I have every encountered . Not even worth the $ 39 price . DVDs do n't play , remote only works if you stand inches from the player . Absolutely awful . Mine works occasionally , but I am just going to throw it in the trash as I can replace with a good player for little money now . Do not recommend ! Update . It is now in the trash . 	DVDPlayer
... I have to say I 'm pleased with this unit is and under statement ... it 's sleek and a handsome unit . The remote -LRB- which lets face it ... to us guys will be held more then our spouses -RRB- is comfortable and easy to read -LRB- again for us guys -RRB- and easy to use -LRB- a major plus -RRB- and handles the unit great . The picture is nothing less then Fantastic with a ` THEATER POSITION ' buyton on the remote to change the visual settings and it does a great job of setting he mood for some pictures ... you do n't want Shrek and Hannibal on the same playing field . Then you have the sound quailty which again is top notch , and also has different settings called ' 3D PHONICS ' which emulates a home theater sound on a 2 speaker TV ... and it too works quite well . Overall if you are looking to buy and you can skip past the savings of a APEX , MINTECH , or any of the other cheaper brands , pony up a little extra and spend it on a unit that will last you years to come . So all in all Great Unit that screams for a Home Theater System ... and you wont regret spending the extra -LRB- $ -RRB- on . Thanks ! 	DVDPlayer
I was given the player for Christmas . The first one did not work and I returned it for another . It worked for 5 months and then started freezing either 10 minutes or a hour into a movie . The warranty is only 90 days and then they charge $ 100 to fix it . Plus , the Audiovox customer service people were totally rude and unhelpful . They would not even listen , they just kept telling me to send them money . When I went to try to return it at the store the honest saleman did tell me that this was the DVD player most returned . DO NOT BUY AUDIOVOX 	DVDPlayer
Excellent player , and looks great , too . I have not tried it in multiregion mode or at 240V , but have no doubts it will work . Despite what Thai Dang Vu said in his review , DP300 IS in fact 240-volt compatible . I was slightly puzzled when I looked at the label on the back -LRB- of DP300 -RRB- indicating it 's 120V . I then called Norcent technical support , who told me that since my player was from a batch manufactured for sale in US , it mentioned only the 120 , but that all units work at 240 . I then called my friend in Europe for whom this player was a gift , and a few minutes later he informed me that the player works like a charm . He has a PAL TV , and was able to view US DVDs I sent him , as well as region-free and region-locked DVDs from UK , Russia , China , and Italy -LRB- I stopped following up at that point : -RRB- This time I purchased 2 302Vs , tried them here in the US just to see if they work -LRB- and they do -RRB- , mailing them to my relatives in Europe now . By the way , Norcent 's Tech Support is fantastic , they pick up quickly -LRB- 1-2 minutes -RRB- and will answer any of your questions -- feel free to inquire about specific countries \/ regions \/ voltages .

pros : multi zone , lots of gimmicks like ripping cds into mp3 right to a usb stick , usb input etc cons : the unit i received had a modified power supply that can handle 220v as well as 110v . i consider that to be a fire hazard . this is not a manufacturer-authorized modification , so it is not subjected to manufacturer 's QA inspection . this , btw , was not mentioned on the product page . picture and sound quality are mediocre compared to the SONY DVP-SR500H i bought instead .

Bought to have a spare . I have had the previous model for over two years now playing at least 3 hours a day without problems so far . Needed a backup just in case and the price was great ! 	DVDPlayer
I thought I might be disappointed when it arrived based on other reviews but not so ! Very impressed - easy to use , started dubbing VHS tapes immediately w\/o even looking at the manual . This was exactly what I wanted for the price I paid - which was $ 249 . If you need this type of unit , VHS to DVD dubbing , then do n't pass this up ! It also has easy connection to copy from camcorder to DVD ! 	DVDPlayer
Got this item and plugged in my equipment without any problems . Love the remote included . Now I do n't have to switch out the equipement from my TV . Easy set-up and easy to use . 	DVDPlayer
Thank goodness for extended warranties as this machine only had a 90 day warranty . It seemed like a nice deal with all of the travel accessories , but buyer beware ... at least purchase a warranty if you decide to try this machine ! 	DVDPlayer
I shipped this product back the same day I received it . Even when using a brand new DVD , it skipped . Sometimes it would not even play at all . Please do yourself a favor and avoid this product . 	DVDPlayer
I have watched this player in a store and in internet I have searched for its features , is amazing , is as good as 414 and maybe better . Right now in this week im going to buy it , then im going to tell you its pros and crons . Remember it is newer than 414 , then it must be better ! 	DVDPlayer
I always knew that Pioneer brand products were excellent quality ; however , I have never purchased a Pioneer product before now because their products are usually very expensive . I purchased this DVD player and am very pleased as the price was reasonable and the quality is the best I have ever seen . I highly recommend this product as I know that it will stand the test of time compared to other brands . 	DVDPlayer
Our daughter loves watching TV , so we take our portable DVD player with us on trips . The battery the player came with only lasts for about 1 movie , so when we traveled to Europe we really needed an extra battery . I found this and it has worked great since we bought it 4 months ago . My only complaint is that it does n't attach to the DVD player , so it 's kind of a pain to have the DVD player AND battery to deal with . 	DVDPlayer
James J - review of Nyrius SW201 HD Component Video Switcher - 3\/15\/2010 This product works perfectly when you want to streamline your component cables going to your TV , or you do n't have enough component inputs on your TV or receiver . The remote is a plus and so is the price ! Installation is pretty straight forward : 3 sets of component cables in and 1 set out . Switching between the 3 is as easy as pushing a button on the remote or on the box itself . Inputs and outputs are labeled clearly . I researched on the internet to find the proper product for functionality and price . This is it ! I have been using mine now for about 6 months and have had no problems . I recommend this product to anyone who has to fix the issue of too many component video YPbPr cables . If you are reading this review than you need THIS product ! 	DVDPlayer
I was skeptical when I ordered this setup because the price seemed too good to be true ! I am happy to report this setup lives up to the description . The sound is great , and it was amazingly easy to set up and connect with my Blu-ray player . The wires are color coded to the connectors on the back of the player , so even someone who is technically impaired can easily put this system together . One small negative ... though I was able to connect the system to my Blu-ray player and have great sound when playing movies through Netflix or DVD 's , I am still trying to figure out how to connect the system to my television to have great sound when watching T.V. . . seriously , this is most likely not a big deal and I am probably missing something quite simple . I will contact the customer service representatives to figure out this minor issue . Another issue is the sound . If you do not turn your sound down to -0 - on the television set the system causes an echo . This is easy to fix . . simply turn the sound on your television set to -0 - and the sound quality will clear up and sound great . 	DVDPlayer
I recieved the Palmtheatre free through a contest . I never really thought about owning one , and I was not about to shell out the money to get one . However now that I have one and know how much that it is used , I would have no problem what so ever purchasing another one . I take it with us on trips , camping . When I go to a friends house that does not have a DVD player , I can take it along , take the patch cords , and my movies . Very nice and convenient product . 	DVDPlayer
The TV tuner needs a good antenna or you need to be close to TV stations . DVD is ok . The file reader from a memory card is very slow . It takes way too long to watch photos . 	DVDPlayer
These were very comfortable , but the sound would cut out when turning my head , or just allowing the cord to swing - as it will when running . Returned both sets . 	DVDPlayer

Bought on-line , picked it up the same day at Circuit City . I liked the idea that I could buy it on line and pick it up at the store the same day and not have to wait a week or two to get the item . 	DVDPlayer
Ok , so I guess its true . You get what you pay for . I paid almost nothing , and that 's what I got . I 'll start off with the good stuff : <p> Usually , if the kids want to see a movie , I can put the movie in , press play , and the kids get to see their movie ... no problem , no issues . Worth the -LRB- minimal -RRB- money I spent . <p> Now the bad news : Movies freeze . They just stop . The machine locks up and I have to turn it off . That has ruined about half the movies I 've seen . I seem to have better luck with the kids movies . I do n't know why . <p> The remote control is terrible . Really . Trust me on this one . You do n't realize how important a good remote control is until you have to deal with one that is this bad . Get this : you have to be within 7ft of the DVD Player for the remote control to work -LRB- this is by design , if you can believe it ! -RRB- When 's the last time you sat within 7ft of you TV ? So if I want to use the remote , I have to get up off the couch , walk two feet forward , and then click . Also , a DVD remote control needs to have some kind of lit buttons\/labels . Think about it . You watch DVDs in the dark . You ca n't see a thing on the remote when its dark . You need to get up , turn the light on , walk two feet forward , then use the remote . And , do n't even talk to me about the miniscule size of the buttons , and the inexplicably pale text on the remote ... are they purposefully trying to hide the names of the buttons ? <p> More bad news : The electronics are fussy . Here 's an example . Try to get a disk out of the player ... just try it , and good luck ! Press the eject button ... nothing happens . Press it again , and the door opens a quarter of an inch then immediately closes . Press the eject button again ... nothing happens . Wait longer ... nothing happens . Press it again , and the door opens a quarter of an inch then immediately closes . No kidding . I once sat in front of this thing for five minutes trying to get the DVD out of the player -LRB- because it was freezing ! -RRB- , unsuccessfully . If there was a hammer within my grasp , I would have smashed the thing to bits . <p> You get the basic idea . ... Pay any more and you got ripped off . I 'd recommend spending a little more and getting a player that actually works . 	DVDPlayer
Having subscribed to Amazon Prime , I was looking for a device to steam it with . Seen as how we did n't have a Blu-Ray player , I figured I 'd get one with wifi and kill two birds with one stone . I was inclined to get Panasonic as my TV is a Panasonic , and panasonic 's are advertised to play well with all their peripherals . This unit was very simple and straight forward to install . It was 10 minutes between unboxing to streaming Amazon and Netflix and Pandora , if you subtract the 10 minutes worth of firmware updates there were . As advertised , my Panasonic TV very nicely turns on when the BluRay is turned on , and switches itself to the right input channel . The USB and SD card functionality works well as well . Occasionally the unit 's software seems to bog down when navigating the internet menus , and the unit does n't seem to stream as well as my Wii for Netflix , but these instances are rare so far . 	DVDPlayer
For the price , this player is a very good value . Manufactured in China and featuring the same firmware as other players -LRB- just with different name plates - check out the Mintek DVD-1810 - including full-size home players -RRB- right down to the menus , it plays many disc formats . <p> Speaking of formats , all those listed work great . I 've confirmed it will not play WMA files . This was n't listed on this page but neither was an S-Video output and the player has it . JPEG pictures can be rotated easily with the left\/right arrow keys on the remote or unit itself if needed . As far as HDCD is concerned , I 'm not sure how much can be achieved using just the player 's built-in speakers . Unfortunately , at least for me , the player does not support DTS in anyway . So forget about selecting the DTS audio option on movies are playing DTS-CDs . <p> Something most sites and `` re-badge manufactures '' of these Chinese players fail to mention -LRB- but should -RRB- is their use of computer type DVD-ROM drives . They may be a little nosier than standard DVD player transports but they are incredibly fast . Navigating menus is quick with minimal load times . Fast forward and fast rewind searches , while not ultra-smooth , are still much smoother than other players and act more like a computer 's DVD-ROM drive . More importantly , layer changes are so quick that they are almost unnoticed , especially if you do n't know where they are beforehand . The player runs very hot and will need proper ventilation . <p> I think everyone should know about the audio\/video output : it 's reversible . I mean it can be made to input signals as well as output them . Think about it . With a RF modulator and a RCA patch cord -LRB- supplied with the player -RRB- this can be a small screen television . Also , the player could be used as a small screen display for video game consoles like X-Box , PS2 and Gamecube . I 've had it hooked up to a VCD\/CDG Karaoke player and it worked great . <p> As for the display , I do wish it was higher resolution but for the price it is quite good . The display surface is quite `` rippled '' when compared to more expensive portable players and laptop computers which are truly flat -LRB- this mostly disappears when a movie is actually playing however -RRB- . The image quality looks closer to 480i instead of 480p . Sharp diagonal lines produce stair-stepping , there is much pixilation in some scenes , etc. . The screen 's brightness is excellent but it is so bright , even on the lowest setting , an accurate black-level will never be obtained . Overall though ; the image is quite pleasing , particularly when you remember you did n't pay $ 700 + to get it . <p> The sound from the speakers is quite good in my opinion . If you plan on setting the volume high enough to fill an entire room then of course they will fall short . Set at an adequate level though , they are quite nice . The headphone jack is always available and works great too . I have n't tried the optical digital out despite having the proper connection and theater system for it . That 's one feature I personally will probable never use having stand alone home DVD players . <p> The remote control is awesome . It is very small and wafer thin yet has all the controls you need . <p> One final thing , a friend of mine from Cambodia let me borrow one of his Region 3 PAL DVDs he could not play and it played in this player ! I can not confirm the disc 's Region 3 coding -LRB- it is listed as such on the packaging which is mostly in Khmer -RRB- but I can confirm that it is in the PAL video format . So add PAL\/NTSC conversion to this player 's list of `` hidden '' features too . 	DVDPlayer
In the past I 've played DVDs on my HDTV and it was widescreen but with black bars all around and I was forced to ZOOM on the TV causing the picture to be a little pixelated and the quality not great . With this upconverting DVD player the picture is amazing . The quality is similar to watching old non-HD tv shows that have been converted to HD , such as old Law and Order episodes , the show was n't shot in HD , the quality on the HD channel is definately better than SD but not quite HD-quality . If you get this player make sure to adjust the settings , I had to specifically set it to 1080P this was not the default . 	DVDPlayer
This was a Christmas gift , one that I had high hopes for . Alas , it was a total letdown . When I first plugged it in , all it would display is `` LOCK '' , which I could n't get rid of . The manual was -LRB- and continued to be -RRB- of no help . The customer service line disconnected me twice . I found out how to get past this on the internet . Then , I could get no audio . My older DVD player used those very same lines with no problems , so it had to have been the JVC player . I am amazed that a company that could turn out such an inferior product could stay in business . 	DVDPlayer
Another reviewer mentioned the horizontally `` squeezed '' look of the picture . Indeed , when first taken out of the box , the DVD player is set to display on a 16x9 set -- not what most of us have these days ! All one has to do to `` fix '' this is to go to the settings menu and set your TV type according to what you have -LRB- I used 4x3 , letterbox and the picture looks just fine -RRB- . <p> The remote control is better laid out than many that ship with similarly-priced DVD players . A\/V quality is pretty standard . There are component , RCA , S-video , and both coax and optical digital audio outputs . <p> I lowered the point score of my review for the following reasons : <p> 1 -RRB- The remote control sensitivity is below average . It works , but it 's not nearly as sensitive as most of my other equipment ; <p> 2 -RRB- There 's only one set of RCA A\/V outputs . Granted , it has a full complement of outputs -LRB- see above -RRB- , but an additional set of RCA A\/V outputs would have been helpful in my particular configuration . 	DVDPlayer
This was my first Toshiba product ever . And I am most satisfied with it . I saw that Toshiba was one of the developers of the DVD and it shows with their fine players . This player is excellent . Great video with progressive scanning , incredible sound with very realistic surround sound effect , well laid-out , ergonomically designed remote control , and solid craftsmanship on the player . Probably the best thing about this player and all Toshiba 's is their ability to ZOOM on a picture . I have a standard TV and I get really annoyed when DVD 's are only made for widescreen . And with my old player I would only see half the screen and get those annoying black lines at the top and bottom of the screen . No more . This player has a zoom that eliminates that problem , and now I get the whole picture . Furthermore , now I can finally see why DVD is so much better than video . Toshiba does not have the name like SONY and Yamaha , but their products are fantastic and a lot less money . This unit is -LRB- $ $ $ -RRB- less than a comparable SONY -LRB- which does not even offer a ZOOM feature -RRB- Buy this DVD , it maybe the best player on the market with no exceptions ! 	DVDPlayer
First let me thank `` Linard7 '' for his helpful review . I followed his lead and did NOT buy any of the confusing array of accessories that comes up on the screen . I only watch DVDs and have no need for Karaoke or any of the other options . This arrived from Amazon.com right on time , in perfect condition , and I had it working within minutes . I am a 71-year-old woman , so it really IS easy ! 	DVDPlayer
THis machine was so good I sold my other dvd 's and bought 2 of these . It plays everything I want -- including SVCD and MP3 -- It could use some GUI inprovement for MP3 . . and a remote on\/off - other then that the unit is the best I 've used . . 	DVDPlayer
It was advertised as multi region 1-6 but it would not play European DVDs . I bought it as a gift for a friend in Europe thinking it would be perfect for the region . The biggest issue I had with it was that the item clearly was not new . Scratches , screen protective plastic unstuck half way . After I checked it thoroughly I decided to keep it anyway as it would have been too much trouble to go thru the return process and I did n't have the time as it most likely would take weeks to get it back . 	DVDPlayer
I bought one for myself and another for my boyfriend . We needed new headphones for the gym . We used to have problems with the cord always getting tangled up on our last headphones . No issues with tangling at all with these and the sound quality was an upgrade as well . Highly recommended ! 	DVDPlayer
Product works great . Just what I needed since my surround sound reciever only has 1 fiber optic input . Hooked it up & have no problems . 	DVDPlayer
I do think they are a terrible company that does NOT stand by their products . First off , I bought 2 items . This item and another combo TV\/DVD player . NOT ONLY WERE BOTH `` Defective '' -LRB- their words -RRB- , but I had to pay to ship to them and GET THIS - include a $ 25 money order for them to send back . Its just outrageous that they conduct business this way . NO ONE should ever buy Coby electronic products b\/c companies like these do not deserve to be in existence . If you are going to sell products STAND BEHIND them . If they are defective , fix them , or replace them . Do n't make the customer pay for your defective technology . SHAME ON YOU Coby Electronics ! 	DVDPlayer
I 'm building a swamp cooler from a bucket and spare parts for Burning Man and this fan has it all : quietness , speed , high cfm and rpms , low amps , and small ! Great fit . : -RRB- The seller is prompt and their products are great . I 'd highly recommend . 	Fan
It 's working well and good price . It has no much noise . Easy to assembly Best of luck for the summer and it helps to cool you off 	Fan
THIS IS GREAT , IF YOU WANT TO KEEP YOUR BARBIE DOLL COOL ... THE actual size of it is about the size of the pic ... TINYY !!!!!!!!!!! 	Fan
This was a bit too small for my netbook and the fan was really small . My netbook gets rather warm and will need a cooler with more cooling . 	Fan
This is a great fan if you are looking for something quiet for sleeping or a nursery or something . Ours is just in the living room to move the air and keep the area cooler . It 's cool looking and modern , and you can change the height of the airflow , but the oscillation speed is one speed only and it 's very slow . . The top of the fan is big and really heavy , and the base is wide but even still , one wagging tail on a dog literally almost knocked this thing over . I would be nervous to have it around little kids , and worry about it falling in general . Otherwise it 's a fan , and it 's cooling me off in the heat . : -RRB- 	Fan
This fan is not battery operated even though it came up in my search for `` battery operated clip on fan '' . Very disappointed ! 	Fan
This fan is well worth for the price . At first , I was thinking that it may not be effective given that the blades are made of plastic Almost 75 % of the fan parts are made of the plastic . Also was concerned that my wife will not support by decision to buy this since it may look cheap fan made of plastic . However , when the fan arrived in a nicely packed box from Amazon and once I assembled it within less than 10 mins and when my wife saw it , she was very much impressed . Turning the switch on further amazed us as to how effective this fan was . It gives out a nice breeze and is very powerful fan . One afternoon , I noticed my ceiling fan which was switched off started rotating and I thought I had left a window open . But then I noticed the ceiling fan was moving because of the Lasko 2527 which was running at a distance of over 15 feet . And that too the Lasko which was set on the floor was driving the ceiling fan which was atleast 5 feet heigher . I was quite impressed . I found this a little expensive compared to a $ 16 pedestal fan I bought at one of the local brick and mortar retailer stores , but for the price you pay , you get a nice breeze out of this fan . And although it is made of plastic , it actually looks expensive fan . Plus the black finish gives it a nice elegant look so as to be kept in a living room . We even took on our vacation getaway and I could collapse it by turning the height adjustment knob to bring the height down by a few feet . One thing to note is that it is not a quiet fan , but we like a little noise when we sleep and the noise from this fan does not bother us at all . This was a harsh summer but we were kept cool with this fan . I will be buying another one if I ever need another for one of our bedrooms ! But we are almost nearing fall and it will start getting cooler in another couple of weeks . I would go for it if Amazon drops the price . For now we are good as we already have 3 pedestal fans . But if you are shopping around for a quality fan at a reasonable price , buy this one and you wo n't regret it ! In my opinion , its money well spent . 	Fan
Was n't prepared for how big this fan is . . that being said , like other reviewer 's noted , it 's super quiet . . which is a great plus ! So , I 've found a spot for it on the corner of my desk and so far so good . . hopefully , it 'll help me be less reliant on my A\/C 	Fan
The fan works well for a short while on the two d batteries . Then it begins to slip away , so not good for many hot nights or hot days . It was purchased for bedside around the house . I have heard that Walmart sells a model that includes a 3 v ac adaptor . The one Amazon sells includes an ad for an adapter for -LRB- I think -RRB- an additional $ 14.95 . Rip off . It should include the adapter . 	Fan
I think this fan is a good value ; I purchased two for under $ 20 each . The fan seems to produce sufficient breeze to cool one person . It 's most effective when it is up to 5 feet away from you at the lowest setting ; or up to 10 feet away at the highest setting . It does produce some noise but I consider it to be more like white noise rather than a distraction ; especially after I `` fixed '' the bottom of the stand . The fix : well , it makes no sense to me that the bottom has four little round feet ; but only two of them have rubber stoppers at the end ; while the other two are bare . This is true of both units I purchased . My fix was to take two of the rubber stoppers from one unit and placed it on the other so that one fan has all four stoppers and the other does not . Then I put felt pads on the other . When left bare , the bottom rattles against the floor or desk surface and produces a loud sound . I took a star off for this oversight . Otherwise , I like this fan . From reading other reviews , I hope mine lasts a long time . Otherwise , I would have to reverse my view that this is a good value . 	Fan
What I could n't tell from the pictures , and I did n't see mentioned in any of the reviews I read -LRB- I did n't read all of them , maybe 10 or so -RRB- is the entire fan cage\/grill is PLASTIC that snaps together . It does n't look too bad in the picture but in real life it looks SUPER cheap . The fan cage\/grill SNAPS together , I do n't know how I feel about that if it 's going to come apart if it 's bumped into . Quick shipping by Amazon , and an affordable price , but if had known it was all PLASTIC and not a metal wire cage I would NOT have bought this . Honestly the only reason I bought it from Amazon is all the local stores ran out of stand fans . If I had seen this in a store I would have kept walking . Only time will tell if my wife decides this thing is too cheap & tacky looking to stay in the living room . I suspect it will get migrated to a guest bedroom and I will be buying a better fan in the near future . 	Fan
I 'm very happy with this little fan . It stands ready on my nightstand , and I just reach over and flip it on if I wake up with a hot flash -LRB- which happens all too often these days -RRB- . It has a low and a high fan speed . Also , I 'm still on the same first 2 D batteries I put in when I got it two weeks ago , even though I 've often accidentally left it on while sleeping . I like it so much , I 'm buying two more -- my husband wants one for his side of the bed , and the other one 's for my desk at work . 	Fan
Nice fan , Nice design but awful motor . If you want to move air twelve hours a day I suggest you look on . For 15 dollars might be worth it , I paid close to 25 and it burnt out after less than a year . 	Fan
If you 're after quietness , this is one of the best quiet fans available today . If you slow it down a bit -LRB- your motherboard might be able to do that , or look online for tricks to feed it 9V , 7V , or even 5V -RRB- , you 'll have one of the quietest and best performing fan you can get . This fan crushes most of the competition -LRB- Scythe are also good -RRB- in the noise\/cooling ratio . In this category , it will do great as a replacement for your CPU fan or video card fan . The rubber mounts are a nice addition . 	Fan
I bought 3 of these fans and I have been experiencing recurrent problems with 1 of them . The problem is that the fan likes to turn itself on . I contacted Hunter who said that is was caused by an interference and we needed to change the code on the remote and the fan . We did that and the problem persisted . Hunter informed us that the codes sometimes needed to be changes several times . We have now changes the codes 5 times -LRB- this is not a trivial task -RRB- and the problem is still persisting . One of the other fans is now intermittently having the same problem . This has been extremely frustrating , and I will never buy a Hunter product again . These fans are meant to be energy efficient , but they are actually costing us more due to the fact that they turn themselves on . Also , the light is very florescent and ca n't be dimmed , which is very unpleasant . I am stuck with 3 of these fans , and really regret buying them . 	Fan
The fan was awesome , and easy to put together except that the end of the adjustment pole was n't straight and i had to saw off a half an inch or so off of the pole to get it to fit onto the fan head . But it worked in the end and puts out decent air . 	Fan
Love this - its quiet , small and really powerful . I use it under my desk to keep my legs cool and the white noise is far less than other fans I have used . Recommend ! 	Fan
I received my fan in great time . The only issue I had was putting the `` casing '' together . It says it is supposed to snap in ... but it was n't as easy as that . 	Fan
Not a bad fan at all , slightly noisy , but pushes a good about of air . When it arrived , the box was in great shape , but the top portion of the plastic frame was cracked - apparently broken prior to packaging at the warehouse or manufacturer . It 's annoying but not unsafe . For the price , it is n't worth it to me to fuss with returning it , although Amazon has made returns fairly painless in the past . 	Fan
I needed a fan to move the air around in my beer kegerator and my brother in law told me about this fan and I got it this is perfect for what I needed it does a superb job I very happy with it . 	Fan
Ive had this fan a little over a year at my office , where for whatever reason they keep the place hot . I use it almost all the time on a low\/medium setting . However after a while it started clicking , then it would no longer start up . So now its basically dead . Im impressed with the durability engineering capabilities of Honeywells staff such that they can design the thing so it dies just 3 months out of warranty . I definitely dont feel I got my moneys worth from it . I just ordered a Vornado Zippy from Amazon as a replacement , hopefully it is more durable . 	Fan
This is a very good fan for small spaces . We ordered one for our daughter 's dorm room to use at her desk or use at night . It conveniently clips on to the side of her desk and circulates a steady stream . It arrived quickly and is doing a great job . 	Fan
Perfect size and capacity for my small apartment , cools down rooms very quickly . Love it being so light weight and easy to lift , excellent choice . Delivery was exceptional and fast , ordered one day , received the next afternoon . Price was right , and it does the job ! 	Fan
PROS : Compact design Puts out an impressive amount of air for it 's size Runs quietly , more descreate -LRB- when you use it @a restaurant table -RRB- Fits in your medium size purse or packs well for travel Lightweight Takes only 2 D cell batteries -LRB- cheaper & less weight -RRB- Still running on the same alkaline batteries we put in 3 weeks ago ! Not power hungry , should last a weekend camping trip running almost constantly CONS : None that I can think of ! We had the larger version of this fan , but had left it at the beach house . We needed to take something with us on our trip to Nicaragua from April into May as I 'm dealing with hot flashes on occassion and the town of San Juan del Sur is not air conditioned - anywhere . The averge temperature - high 90 's - think `` Dog Days '' of August - in Huston or the Florida swamps . There are only dirt roads outside of the town , so one needs a 4 wheel drive vehicle - with air conditioning - just trust me on this , and not because of my hot flashes ! Driving on these roads kicks up a cloud of dust you would NOT believe ! You will need to roll up the windows , put the air on and hit the indoor recycle so that you do n't suck dust into the cabin ! Even then , we still could smell the dirt ! Now that I 've set the the stage , this little fan quietly supplemented the few restaurants with ceiling fans and no air conditioning . The base adjusts the angle and snaps the rest of the way , flat against the back of the fan for packing and storing . It also fits in my small , backpack-style purse easily and was a lot lighter than the the larger one as it only takes 2 D cells . We lived in a time-share house outside of town that looked beautiful online and said it was air-conditioned . I noted the stove , coffee maker , plates and microwave - which is all I needed for our 25th wedding anniversary trip . The roads were NOT mentioned . Neither was the fact that in the entire country , the term `` air-conditioned '' means a unit in your bedroom - nowhere else . Not the kitchen , bathroom , or in the case of a hotel , anywhere else BUT in your room . Also not mentioned is the unpredictability of power . The electric was out about 2\/3rds of the time as we were outside of the town of San Juan del Sur . The town itself was out of power for three hours during a rainstorm . I do n't have to tell you how well the air conditioning works during a power outage ! We took this fan everywhere with us . Going through market places , eating at restaurants , going for free WIFI at coffee houses and such . We kept it in the bathroom as it was so hot and humid in there , my makeup was melting ! -LRB- I started keeping it in the fridge -RRB- Heck , I was melting ! This little fan sat between the two of us all night as we lay on top of the covers getting what sleep we could . The power was out 17 hours straight one night . You just never knew when you would have power . I ran the coffee maker when power was on and then kept the coffee in the fridge . Who wants hot coffee anyway when it 's so hot ? We conserved what water we had as it requires a pump to get to the tank on top of the house . No unneccessary flushing ! Needless to say , do n't drink the water . Anywhere . We tried to calculate how many hours she ran during our 2 week vacation ! At least 10 hours of bathroom use , probably more . An approximate hour or so at each dinner we ate out at , that was about 14 + hours for that , several hours of touring around town - difficult to calculate , the 17 hour power outage where I never went anywhere without it turned on and running . Multiple , sporadic outages requiring it 's use during the night or day . So that is probably 48 hrs and still counting ! I think you could go on a weekend camping trip with one set of alkaline batteries and run that fan continuously ! A LOT less weight in your backpack if you 're not packing extra D cells ! We took her out , one week after coming back from our trip to take her to Region 8 World Tang Soo Do kids Black Belt camp this past weekend . She is showing no signs of slowing down on that same set of batteries ! I even found a pocket sized fan from O2Cool that you wear around your neck that I took to the camp so I would n't drip sweat on my patients , and that worked pretty well , too ! I had to add a lanyard squeeze toggle so I could adjust the length of the string , and put a piece of tape on the slider switch so it would n't turn itself on all the time , but that was pretty handy as well . I would tuck it in the top pocket of my scrub shirt when not in use , and sometimes when I was using it so it would n't wave it in a patients face ! Very cool product ! Literally and figuratively .

got this fan 2 days ago but there is somthing wrong with the fans one working and the other one not ! crosair dispoint me realy : -LRB- 	Fan
I purchased this fan for my son 's bedroom . It arrived very quickly , and it is exactly what I was looking for . I assembled it myself in about 10 minutes , and I 'm in my third trimester of pregnancy . The directions are clear and easy to follow , and there were no tools required for assembly . The features I love about this fan are the tilting fan head -LRB- there are 3 tilt positions -RRB- , the oscillating motion , and the three fan speeds . Great fan for the price ! 	Fan
I bought several of these and I love them So quiet no problems !!!! 	Fan
The fan is great quality , however the air power is not very strong . There is n't much difference between the high , med , low . It is very quiet , but wish it produced more air flow . 	Fan
We really like this fan . Could n't find a metal fan anywhere ! Hubby looked more and found this one . It pushes the air around very well . We need it to cool the garage down or when he is in an attic doing work so I would highly recommend it to anyone . :0 -RRB- 	Fan
very light and portable . Extremely quiet . Put toghther easily . For the price and free shipping right to your door you ca n't beat it ! 	Fan
Just as advertised . Works quietly and enough air for desk or small room . Highly recommend as long as you are not looking to cool a large area . 	Fan
Replaced a Delta fan in a Dell . This fan is quiet , but I should have gone with Nexus again . They are definitely quieter . I have a system with 2 Zalman fans and a system with 2 Nexus fans . If you want to get good comparisons of fan noise , check -LRB- ... -RRB- . Definitely used the resistor . Utterly noisy without the resistor . Also : you can connect other fans to the Dell motherboard 4-pin CPU fan header . Just break the plastic socket to make room , and you will avoid the CPU fan BIOS alert . 	Fan
Wonderful fan and very quiet . Easy to setup , very sturdy , with options to pan or stay in one position plus the ability to tilt up . When I use the medium setting , fixed position , pointed over my head I have the advantage of room circulation without distracting background noise or blowing items on my home office desk . 	Fan
My CPU is the i5-2500k . I used the LNA -LRB- black -RRB- wire . Under 100 % load stress tests , CPU temperature hovered around 62 celsius and makes some noise . When playing Starcraft 2 the temperature is about 45-47C . During light use -LRB- typing , web surfing , music , etc -RRB- the temperature is about 36C and the fan is totally silent . The ambient temperature is about 25C . Highly recommended . 	Fan
In the eternal quest for the perfect desk fan , I believe I have landed upon Nirvana . This small , adjustable , strong , quiet little machine is perfect . Perfectly perfect . Admittedly , I just opened the box and plugged it in ... so I ca n't vouch for durability yet . But , so far -- so amazing . 	Fan
This is a cool little feature if you want to simultaneously add and control airflow and help to regulate Memory temerature . Believe it or not I use this fan with a Hyper N520 CPU Cooler -LRB- looks like the transmission from my mustang -RRB- and low-profile ram - it works fabulously . As mentioned in other reviews , a possibly serious drawback is the metal legs . These could easily be pushed or slid to have contact with other components in your case if the legs are n't tight . To top that off they are entirely metal and would short any circuitry they came in contact with . I was trying to dream up a quick insulative solution , like elmer 's and a fine grade snd mixture . This could be applied on the lower two cm of each leg then allowed to dry and possibly sand the solid product . Perhaps even a thick coat or two of fingernail polish would do the trick . Someone else accurately remarked that these fans are not the holy chalice of well oiled ~ Whichever reviewer said it , it was a good idea - a drop of motor oil on the fan spindle should be a semi-permanent fix for the minor scrape sounds I detected . They were n't overpowering or even really obvious , but once the fans had broke the factory seal a bit they began to sound poorly oiled . After the oil these kittens purr , quiet as a baby and they make the entire inner chassie a sacred dwelling place for blue flashy lights . 	Fan
It does what its suppose to do . Keeps the RAM modules nice and cool . No complaints . I use these over 4 sticks of DDR3 Modules . Quiet and cool . Cant go wrong ! GJ Corsair ! 	Fan
What more can you ask for ? This fan works great and is a great price ! I was a little skeptical because I saw a few bad reviews but , turns out it 's just fine . 	Fan
Bought 2 of these for my kids rooms and they work great ! Yes they are made of plastic but they still get the job done . I did notice the first few times I used it that there was a slight burning rubber smell but not a big deal . Sturdy and easy to turn on ! 	Fan
After receiving two out of three of these fans with serious defects , I am forced to conclude that this product is made with zero quality control . The first fan I ordered arrived with minor shipping damage . However the distributor cheerfully sent me replacement parts without charge , and other than this the fan looked great and ran quietly and powerfully . So I ordered another one . However , the second fan arrived with a bizarre defect : it looked like one of the blades had been bent with a pair of pliers ! That a fan looking like this could leave the factory should have been a red flag to me . But since Amazon was willing to replace it without cost and my first impression had not quite been broken , I accepted a replacement , tested both fans again , and then put them away until the summer . Well , now the summer has come , and guess what ? Soon after beginning to use one of the fans I watched it slow down , pick up speed -LRB- but not to its prior speed -RRB- , and then begin to squeak continuously . Bottom line : in less than 20 hours use one of the `` permanently lubricated '' bearings has failed ! I own a fan which has run like new for 10 years without care other than cleaning , but this fan failed in less than a day 's use . It remains to be seen what resolution Amazon and the manufacturer will offer , but no matter what they do , I have wasted my time with this product . Do not buy this brand of fan ! 	Fan
I have just finishing setting up the Lasko pedestal fan . From reading the reviews on Amazon I was prepared for this fan being made completely of plastic and I agree with the reviewers who have said that despite not being made of metal it does n't look cheap . I 'm pleased with how it looks and the price was great so I think that it is excellent value . It 's fairly quiet - not silent but just a smooth hum that is n't distracting . I also wanted to mention how easy it was to assemble . It was out of the box and running within 10 minutes . The last fan I bought was very fiddly to put together and took more than an hour of puzzling over badly drawn diagrams before it was ready to use so I was very pleased at the contrast with the Lasko fan which I thought was well-designed so that the minimum number of separate parts are used and has clearly written instructions . I gave it 4 stars because I do n't know yet if it will turn out to be reliable - I have no issues so far . 	Fan
I ordered this for traveling in the car . My husband has to have air blowing on him , which means the air conditioning is set low and freezes me ! This fan does the job . I can keep the air blowing on him and the temperature in the car is more comfortable ! I do n't have to wear gloves in the car when it is 95 degrees outside ! The only improvement I would ask is to have a way to attach it to something in the car so that he does n't have to hold it all the time ! 	Fan
Love this fan !!! Had a similar one that was made by a different copany that died on me , so When I found this one I was delighted . If you want a window fan that is able to oscillate this is the solution . Love it !!! 	Fan
I am ordering a 2nd fan for one of our offices . It is light weight ... making it easy to move around . The employees like the fact that it is a little bit noisy and drowns out noise from each other . We are using them in small rooms , one has a lot of windows , to circulate air when adjusting the thermostat is n't quite enough . I 've had the first one about 6 months . I did n't put it together , so I ca n't speak to that . 	Fan
Though I have n't used this fan a lot but it looks good to me , pretty light and less noisy . However , it does n't have the oscillation feature and also has this fuse functionality in the plug which in my opinion may be a hassle in future . Overall , it 's good . 	Fan
- No assembly required - Does n't move as much air as I had hoped , but moves enough air to satisfy - A bit off balance so it wobbles a little , but it does n't wobble enough to be a concern - Satisfied with the product overall 	Fan
HHave had this fan in 24\/7 for three years . It is wonderful . Might be a little noisy but not distracting at all ... thinking of getting another for other side of room . Cuts down on a\/c ... 	Fan
This fan works great . Kicks up lots of air flow . I bought two of them and they dramatically help keep my loft cool . My house has AC but my loft is always hot no matter how cool the AC is set . I put one in the back of the loft and one near the stairs and railing . The loft is now nice and cool like the rest of the house . Do n't expect some small table top fan . These are big and you will want them on the ground . 	Fan
For the money , this is a great fan . No squeaks , rattles even when oscillating . That leaves just white noise ... great for sleeping . 	Fan
Wanted a fan for the bedroom at night and this guy does the job ! It does make an audible noise as other reviewers have noted , but I like white noise at night so this is a perk for me . This fan outputs a good amount of air - so much better than my previous tower fan . It 's also great to set in a window sill and really get the breeze moving . 	Fan
Our local Wellness Center uses three of these fans during exercise\/treadmill use . The fan is metal construction and puts out a good flow , even at lower speeds . It seems to be an excellent fan for the money . 	Fan
I have the old HT800 model -LRB- the model on this page is the new HT900 model -RRB- -- I love the old HT800 because it 's really loud and drowns out noise when I sleep . I decided to get another Honeywell fan for the same purpose , and unfortunately , Honeywell decided to make this model that is purportedly 25 % quieter than the old HT800 . It seems like it 's more like 50 % quieter . Not happy . I returned the fan and am now looking for another loud fan . Honeywell , why would you do such a thing ??? 	Fan
I purchased a few tower fans before this one , but none were tall enough to feel while laying in bed . This fan is more than tall enough , is built solidly , easy to assemble , and has plenty of settings . The remote control is nice -LRB- batteries not included -RRB- and the fan has a wide range of timer settings and a height adjustment . Just what I needed for this already hot summer . 	Fan
I bought this fan for my office as the AC is not as cool as I want sometimes . I did not want a little fan that people leave on a desk . Bought this fan because sometimes I want a real strong breeze . I leave this fan besides me on the floor . When I feel the need for some breeze I turn this fan on and my colleague sitting 20 feet to my right feels the breeze as well . He has been recently asking me to turn it on so he can cool down . I did not expect such a powerful fan at this price . I leave the fan on on the lowest speed . Never had the need to turn it on medium or high . I loved it so much I bought a second cyclone for my home as well . 	Fan
Love to review products before I buy , never write them so ... . Bought this for my husband who sleeps hot and keeps me and the kids freezing at night . It works great , it 's quiet , it can be adjusted to fit just right . I had to put a box under mine to fit the height of the mattress . We keep it on his side of the bed and I do n't feel a thing . The best thing is the air temperature can be kept more reasonable than 66 which should save us considerably in the summer months ! I would recommend this product if one of you or both sleep hot or suffer from night sweats , it will help . 	Fan
I bought one of these originally at Menards , at was very happy with the amount of air this thing circulates . I live in an converted attic apartment , and the living room windows are the kind that open out , so an air conditioner can not be installed . By purchasing another one of these fans I am able to move the air from the bedroom a.c. to the living room and keep it cool ! This fan is a must have for anyone who needs to cool an area ! 	Fan
I had a desktop\/server machine that was locking up , and after doing some analysis I found that the CPU fan was running slowly , and would speed up and slow down on its own , causing the CPU to overheat and the server to lock up . I replaced the existing CPU fan on my ATX motherboard with this one , and the CPU is running fine and no lockups so far . Reasonably priced , installed easily , and working great , what more can you ask for ? 	Fan
I bought this item to replace a dying pedestal fan for my bedroom . Our bed is raised up off the ground so we needed something taller than the norm - preferably something that did n't need to be adjusted for height because we all know that over time those extensions start to give way . The fan comes with a nifty little remote and a couple of different options for timers . It 's sleek , efficient , and looks good . The only real downside to it is that its highest power setting is n't quite powerful enough for my taste . It 'd probably be perfect for someone 's living room while entertaining guests , but if you want to feel the power and get some noise-maker quality , this is just a little too quiet . 	Fan
I bought this fan as a sleep fan to drown out the snoring of the other guys on my FD and I am disappointed in this fan . The amount of air this fan produces is not what I would have expected from a fan of this size even on the high setting . It also is much quieter than previous versions of this fan . It may be good for use in a small room to move some air but in a standard beedroom or dorm room in my case , it just does n't cut it . 	Fan
This is a great little fan . It is VERY quiet . I have to look at it and see if the blades are moving to tell if it 's on or not . I have it in my bedroom doorway to blow the heat from my pellet stove out in the living room that comes down the hallway . The fan moves it into my bedroom . It helps keep that room warmer . It 's the only room that was n't really getting the heat , but with this fan , it 's fine now . I would recommend this to anyone looking for a quiet doorway fan . 	Fan
I am very happy with my purchase . I have a tall bed so I purchased the fan for the height which is perfect . It is easy to move around the house and the remote control is so convenient . 	Fan
Bulbs not included with fan . Appearance is very good . Great shipping . Not too happy about going out to the hardware to find the specific bulbs to fit the light fixture . 	Fan
First time using a Noctua fan . Not crazy about the colors -LRB- only Austrians would choose pink and brown ! -RRB- but who cares about that inside the case . I also had no success using the supplied Vibration dampeners , broke off two of them trying to mount so I just used the supplied screws . I used this to replace a generic 92 mm exhaust fan on a rebuild I 've done for a friend of an older HP system . Once I booted up I literally had to put my head near it to hear it and I checked that the blades were actually turning . Pushes sufficient air for the needs of this system . Cons : Pricey . You could easily get 2 generic fans for the price of this one but you would n't come close to the quality and quietness of this fan . Highly recommend . 	Fan
After buying new leather furniture for our dark living room , all it needed was a new ceiling fan . The old one was ugly , noisy and did n't have a light . This new one exceeded our expectations . It is good looking , I like the globe rather than individual lights , and it is very quiet . Now I ca n't wait for summer to use the fan . Now we wo n't have to turn the TV up to compensate for the noisy fan . It is perfect ! 	Fan
I am frustrated with this fan . This is not the kind of thing I normally would buy on the internet because it 's just too much trouble to deal with if you do n't like it . Amazon does make it kind of easy to send it back , but this is the type of item I would rather look at in the store . I swear a piece must be missing because there is no way to attach the pedestal to the motor case . Unless you are desperate for a cheap fan , leave this one alone . This is number two , I sent the first one back for the same reason . I have put many fans together before and I 'm not stupid , so I do n't think the user is the problem in this case . 	Fan
I bought this fan based strictly on reviews . Initially I am very pleased with the purchase . Just $ 31 for this fan seems like a fantastic buy . It is relatively quiet for the amount of air it moves around . On the low setting it does a fine job at low noise level . On high it moves a lot of air and is noisier as it should be . Overall Lasko has hit a home run with this model . 	Fan
After 2 years using NV + , finally I decided to replace the noisy stock fan . It was very simple to replace the stock fan . I have it running in 15 mins . The fan keeps the system as cool as the stock fan but only at half of the RPM . In addition it is very quite . No more annoying fan noise . It comes with installation screws which I did not need to use . 	Fan
Just a average fan . On high it does n't really blow air very well . What it is good for is putting in corners or in rooms that you do n't a fan in the window . Very quiet , just wish on high speed it would blow more air . 	Fan
Ordered product on Tuesday and recieved it on Friday . Talk about fast delivery !! Ca n't wait to put fan together and keep room cool . FANTASTIC ! 	Fan
I personally have had these fans for 4 years . My uncle had bought them years before that when his air-conditioning broke , and he needed something powerful . I now use them in my vacation house which has no air-conditioning . The internal isolating feature is amazing . We have more than one and use them frequently , and never had an issue with them . I ca n't speak for their durability outside since I 've always used it indoors , but indoors its great ! Only problem its a bit loud so do n't expect to hear the person in bed next to you . 	Fan
Were got this fan about a week ago and we 've had no problems with it . Easy too put together and even tho we have it across the room I car still feel it on the lowest setting . Very quiet . 	Fan
I like my netbook cooler . It is very comfortable in use and keeps my netbook in good condition . 	Fan
Quite large and it does move a lot of air . I use it positioned as low as the stand will go . I enjoy a fan in each room even when the air conditioner is on to keep the air circulating . 	Fan
I have been purchasing Hunter Fans for over 30 years and this is the most expensive one I ever bought and the first I have had trouble with . The problem is in the remote control receiver , they say . I now own 3 similar Hunter fans and none work very well . Hunter customer service is better than most , at least you are talking to an English speaking rep in USA . Unfortunately , after two calls to customer service , I ca n't get them to commit to honoring their warranty on a fan that 's only a few months old and did not work properly from day one . 	Fan
I bought this fan in hopes that it would move more air than my 20 '' box fan . It does . When comparing the two , the Lasko fan moved more air on setting 1 -LRB- lowest -RRB- than the box fan did on setting 2 . On setting 1 , the air movement from the Lasko can be felt roughly 8ft away . The stand keeps the fan stable and allows you to pivot the fan just like it says . There is also very little noise from the motor . The majority of the sound it creates is just from the amount of air it 's actually moving . In my opinion , it 's quiet enough to use in a bedroom . 	Fan
This is just about the best fan I 've ever used . BAR NONE . I have one in my living area , positioned on the floor between my couch and my computer desk . Even on the lowest setting it keeps me cool and comfortable . My second one is in the bedroom , and also keeps the room feeling great . It is a GREAT product . It is also nice and quiet , and far more sturdy than tower fans . I swear by HONEYWELL , One fan is seven years old , and the other will be two in August . They 've paid for themselves 10 times over in what I 've saved in air-con costs . 	Fan
This fan is wonderful . It has a small `` footprint '' which is what we were looking for . It is a plus that it is an outdoor fan . The only con would be that it is a heavy and difficult to move from one place to another . We had a problem with the first fan , but customer service was the best !!! 	Fan
I had help on the installation , so I ca n't speak to that -- it looked easy for a guy who 's done it before . The fan itself is good-looking and functions well -- but the remote is a bit tricky and seems to have a mind of its own , in spite of what the manual says . I may call the factory on that , but the unit itself is fine . One Year Later : We bought two of these FANS . They look great , move air just fine and are quiet . After reading the Amazon reviews , we did swap out the light for a softer coil - that 's fine . One of the fans is flawless and we have no complaints , the other one suffers from the poltergeist effect mentioned by another reviewer . The fan goes on high by itself while we are gone or while we are asleep , the light comes on by itself in the middle of the night and scares us . My husband called Hunter customer service who told him to change the jumper arrangement . He spent a couple of hours perched on a ladder changing the jumper settings , put the unit back together and had a beer . 30 minutes later the danged light went on by itself again ... and the fan continues to jump into action at random times . Of course we do n't want it to come on while we are out of town , so we turn off the breaker when we go on vacation . Will call Hunter again , but the hassle has outweighed the classy look . Phooey , classy look , but flawed . 	Fan
After reading all the reviews and recommendations , I decided to try these case fans . I was pleasantly surprised at just how quiet they really are . I have them installed in a custom built HTPC ; replacing the case fans on a Tsunami tower . One for intake at the front , one for exhaust on the side panel -LRB- after modifying the panel -RRB- and one to replace the fan on a Corsair H50 cpu cooling system that was much too loud for my liking . I did not use any of the included mounts or wiring to lower noise or speed . The fans ' speeds are controlled by the mother board . From 10 feet away , in a quiet room , you can barely notice that the computer is running ; and , then , only if you are aware of it . As far as the cooling properties , the internals of the computer remain consistant at 46 degrees C under load . This is a room with an ambient temperature of 78 degrees F. I am about to modify my personal computer with a similar setup . I highly recommend these cooling fans for performance and noise reduction . I have been building my own computers for over ten years and will be using these from now on . 	Fan
So many reviewers seem to never actually read the description of the products they buy . This little fan is , by nature and purpose , `` little . '' It is meant to cool you off within reason . It is the perfect little fan to have near you , by your desk , nightstand or next to your favorite lazy-boy chair . Why do people insist on trying to force it to be more than what it is meant to be ? All I can tell you is that I bought this Wespointe fan two years ago for my office desk and then decided to purchase another for my home desk . They are built like a tank , all metal , no plastic anywhere in sight . They provide exactly what they are meant to deliver : a pleasant , quiet flow of air to cool you off . Want a heavy blast of air ? Buy something else . Want a little workhorse to cool you nearby ? Get this little gem . 	Fan
I replaced a noisy 80mm fan with this one in the back of my case and the difference is nothing short of phenomenal . Now , most of the noise I hear is from the CPU and power supply fans , and if I 'm not next to the machine it 's often hard to tell that it 's running ... even in an empty house . Great product ! To the previous reviewer that could n't tell the `` low noise '' and `` ultra low noise '' adapters apart , there is a small slip of paper that came with the fan . The adapter with the red shrink-wrapped part -LRB- resistor -RRB- is the low noise . The one with the black shrink wrap is the ultra-low noise . However , the fan is so quiet that I opted for the higher air flow and did n't bother with either of these . 	Fan
Had two of these before to use mainly onstage for shows and they both pumped . Ordered this one and was surprised and a little upset with the output being so weak . Seemed like it was a smaller\/weaker motor in the same exact models that I had before of this product . The frame was also flimsier and weaker . Still a good fan though . 	Fan
The bulk of this fan is made out of light plastic . It might feel cheap , but it 's more than sufficient for it to perform its duties . It has a wide , solid base and light for easy moving and relocating from room to room . It moves air very well and the oscillating feature is a definite plus . It was easy to assemble and does n't require any tools to put together . The noise from the wind it produces is tolerable and is expected when it comes to high velocity fans like this . Definitely a good buy and will recommend it to others looking for a high velocity oscillating fan like this . 	Fan
It cools down my room . it oscillates and it is very quiet . even on the 3rd speed it is still quieter than other high velocity fans . overall I 'm satisfied , it is thinner and taller than my previous high velocity fan from lasko . the remote control works good . have n't had a problem with it . I have it running day and night because it 's been really hot lately . it still works as good as the first day and I believe I had this fan for 3 week or a month now . 	Fan
I like the price of this fan and it was simple enough to put together , but not the quality I had hoped for . You put the plastic parts together . The issue with the one I got was all of the plastic clips that hold the fan protector on did not all line up and those that did , did not clip in completely . I actually had to use krazy glue to get a tight fit . 	Fan
It is a bit loud and it does not really chill the room down . It is like you hear the sound of the fan working but you look around and you dont know where you should sit to enjoy the results of having a fan on . 	Fan
This is a great fan for a great price . It was super easy to assemble and the speed control is awesome . The highest setting is really powerful and it is n't as loud as fans that are similar . I recommend this fan for anyway who wants a powerful fan for a reasonable price . 	Fan
I have been looking for this fan for quite a long time to match one I already have in the living room . This is a great fan , runs quietly and looks great . However , the shipper did not pack it very well and the light globe was shattered . Thankfully , it was packed inside a bag and most of the broken glass was contained in the bag . 	Fan
This is the perfect fan for traveling or home use !! Took it on a vacation and it fit perfect in my suitcase . 	Fan
We had a similar Hunter fan on the patio for over 30 years . When it needed replacing , Hunter was the obvious choice . We found the fan on Amazon and purchase was easy and delivery was better than promised . This new fan has more features and looks better than the old one . The design seems to be improved . Installation was simple . Highy recommended . 	Fan
I took a chance and purchased this fan in spite of the reviews . Right out of the box I can say I 've had much larger fans make much less noise , and that 's just referring to the parts which move the air . After only a few hours of operation the oscillation mechanism began making the annoying clicking noises as predicted by other reviewers of this product . Can I live with it ? Yes I can . Do I wish it were more quiet ? Definitely ! This fan produces a gentle stream of moving air . The oscillation pattern is nicely wide , so it covers a broad area with its soft breeze . It does not , however , operate in a `` whisper-quiet '' fashion as advertised . I doubt there 's been a single unit of this model ever produced which could truthfully boast `` whisper-quiet '' operation . 	Fan
I purchased a half dozen fans claiming to be silent -LRB- -LRB- 20dBA -RRB- , and while their fans rotated reasonably quietly at max RPM , and silent at ~ 60 % , all of the motors made some buzzing sounds as low as 20 % . This is the only fan that I 've found thus far that is truly silent -LRB- both motor and fan -RRB- in its entire rotational range . Of course , max RPM is 500 , so you 're definitely not moving a ton of air ... ... but there 's something to be said about being able to rely on the CFM rating instead of buying another fan that might move more air at 100 % RPM , but is so noisy that you have to spin it down to 40 % . I wish someone sold the 800 RPM version -LRB- SY1225SL12L -RRB- on Amazon , as that 's just as silent but moves more air . 	Fan
The fan is quite for how much air it pushes out , but I would spend another $ 5 for one that had `` High\/Low '' settings . 	Fan
I work in a poorly air conditioned area , and this fan keeps me cool . I like that the fan is not large and that it is easy to clip it out of the way . It is also fairly quiet . 	Fan
I bought these fans based on their high reputation for being quiet and long lasting . These are cooling a new , overclocked i7 CPU , and I did n't want to take any chances . I just wish they were a little less expensive . I have some less expensive Coolermaster fans running in other parts of the case , so I 'll see which ones last the longest . Noctuas are significantly quieter to the other fans . 	Fan
This fan is amazing . It has turned terribly hot days into quite tolerable ones . I do n't know what I would do without this thing . I 'm definitely a fan of the fan . 	Fan
if you do not like the noise of standing directly in front of a Boing aircraft , you will not like to run it on level 2 or even 3 . level 1 is also noisy but okay , however , it does not cool down the room ... 	Fan
I have ordered a 2nd one for my son and it works great , it is compact and travels well , if you need a fan to help cool you net book or laptop this is a good one to get . 	Fan
I replaced a Silverstone fan with this unit . It 's VERY quiet , and it increased air flow enough to drop the motherboard temp by 20 degrees ! Only two issues : Which cable is which -LRB- low noise vs very low noise -RRB- ? -LRB- I left off the adapter cables so that the unit can reach its max rpm when needed . Other is the color ... oh well , you ca n't have everything ! 	Fan
Bought two of these for a scout campout , one for my and one for my son . It was HOT and the tents were damp . These were worth their weight in gold . On low setting the batteries lasted 2 nights , and it provides plenty of breeze . I was the envy of all the adults camping that weekend . 	Fan
The wife wanted me to get it for her little sister who just got her license as a gift . It served the purpose until she crashed her car . 	GPS
I updated from a 4.3 inch screen . Really nice unit , I use it to travel the Midwest in My work ! The price was right & shipping was fast . I am very satisfied ! 	GPS
This is my fifth GPS unit . My first GPS unit was a Lowrance GM100 followed by a Garmin and a Magellan Sportrak and then a Lowrance Go2 . All have been good units . I was very inpressed when I first received the Lowrance H20 unit . I was impressed by the screen size first and foremost . Second , I was pleasantly suprised to find the car power adapter . Shortly after purchasing the unit , I bought the software package . It includes the map software , a 64mb SD card and the card reader . I 'm very happy with the set , but I would have preferred a direct cable connection to the unit as opposed to having to use the card reader to transfer data . The software is also somewhat limited in features as well . I would like to see more features involving trails . The maps are great and very accurate . Transferring data works great but is somewhat difficult in that you must remove the card which requires removal of the batteries . I would give the unit five stars if it were n't for the above limitations . If you just look at the unit itself based on accuracy and useability , it definitely ranks five stars . 	GPS
All i have to say is that GARMIN is one the best companies that i have ever dealt with . I have -LRB- 3 -RRB- GARMIN GPS 's . The C340 is an excellent piece to have in your car . I will not go into as to how good it is , because all of the other comments below speak for itself ... What i would like to emphamize is the warranty and service from them . I have recently had my C340 fall due to the window mount failing -LRB- that is another issue that i have addressed to them about -RRB- and the screen cracked , ect . . well , then are not only fixing it for me under warranty , but they are also giving me at no charge a new tripod mount for the dashboard which is over a $ 50 value ... . THEY ROCK ... I wo n't buy any other brand other then Garmin and neither should you ! 	GPS
"Got this as a Gold Box special a couple of weeks ago . My old GPS , a <ahref=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000SATCUQ/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/175-8727456-5384417""> TomTom GO 720 4.3-Inch Widescreen Bluetooth Portable GPS Navigator </a> that never quite worked completely right , was freezing up too often and I could n't get the data service to link up with my new Blackberry , thereby killing the benefit of the traffic subscription . I actually really liked the 720 when it worked -LRB- though that was intermittently -RRB- , which is why I was willing to consider another TomTom in spite of the issues . Besides , the Magellans do n't impress me , I hate my wife 's Garmin -LRB- constant moans of `` re-cal-cu-la-ting '' and last-second turn instructions wear thin -RRB- , and I 'm not about to spend many hundreds of dollars on glorified versions of the free Google Maps app on my phone . That said , it was a good Gold Box deal and about what I paid for the 720 just over a year ago . Considering lifetime maps and traffic were included , it was tough to pass up . I did n't need a ton of bells and whistles , so it seemed to fit the bill of a good replacement for the old one . I did n't pay close enough attention to the product description , so I failed to notice the lack of an SD slot , but , seeing as how I 've never used it on my 720 , that was n't a problem . Well , did I get a good deal ? OUT OF THE BOX The 335 has the same size screen as the 720 and is just a smidge smaller , except when the ring mount is attached making it significantly thicker and not as portable -LRB- though I think most people would n't be packing it that way -RRB- . The suction cup attachment seems much more adhesive than that of the 720 , which I was constantly pushing back against the window since it fell off at least once a week . The little recessed cubby for the USB power\/computer connection is a bit of a pain , requiring more digging around than I 'd like . Overall , its physical ergonomics are pretty pleasing and it seems quite secure when driving . UPDATING THE MAPS Here 's where the first issues came up . If you 've looked at other reviews , you know I 'm not alone in troubles . I already had the TomTom software installed on my XP netbook from my previous GPS , so I was as close to plug and play as one could get . I logged in , switched my account to the new device and it immediately asked me if I wanted to update the map through the Latest Map Guarantee , something that 's promised on all TomToms out-of-box -LRB- in case yours has been sitting on a shelf for a while -RRB- . I did . And so began a process of downloading that took about 90 minutes on my fairly quick Internet connection . Of course , once that was all downloaded , I had another excruciating wait while it transferred the ` latest ' map to the unit . Fine . I put in my time and was ready to get going . But then I got to the ` Update '' screen that lets you know if there are new GPS fixes or Map Share corrections . Strangely , there was a new North America map for me to download . Did n't I just do this ? Based on my experience with the 720 -LRB- and logical programming in general -RRB- I decided to go ahead and click through , figuring the software would tell me if this new map was already on the device . Either the software is really dumb or the ` latest ' map I got under the guarantee was n't in fact the most recent \* , because I waited for another few hours while it went through the machinations and installed the new map on my device . -LRB- \* I supposed there 's the very slight chance that TomTom put out a new map in the time since I first hooked up the new unit , but , as you 're about to see , that probably was n't the case . -RRB- OK , so two updates to get the ` latest ' map . Things could be worse , I suppose . Right ? Right . I entered my registration code for the free lifetime maps and \* SHOCKER \* I was told there was yet another new North America map . This time , I took note of the version numbers : The update took me from version 830.2284 to 850.2781 . I 'm no mathematical wizard , but that seems like a pretty big jump from one version to the next . Three hours later -LRB- and about half a day after I first connected to the system -RRB- , I finally had the last of TomTom 's ` latest ' updates installed . Not a good way to start . It makes the all the guarantees offered by the company seem just a little disingenuous . ON THE ROAD -LRB- INCLUDING COMPARISONS TO MY GO 720 -RRB- This screen is dim . At 100 % brightness on the day settings , it 's about half of my 720 's illumination . This is annoying . It 's not the worst thing in the world for me , since I have good eyesight , but I do n't like it and I think it would make the unit unusable for many people -LRB- my wife included -RRB- . Initial routing is sloooooooow . I would get annoyed when my 720 was taking more than about 10-15 seconds to plan my trip . That is light speed compared to this sloth of a machine . Changing my destination means I better put aside a minute or more of my life while the new GPS goes into a state of deep reflection . If I 'm already moving and want to avoid the traffic delays ahead , I better remember upcoming directions since the screen will go into a mapless ` analyzing ' display for sixty or more seconds . Once it has analyzed alternatives , it might ask if I want to avoid toll roads or carpool lanes . No matter what my answer , it will then go through all the analyses again . Seriously ? It could n't have accounted for the two different possibilities before asking me ? Better yet , it could n't have asked up front so it could simply get it right the first time ? I never had any kind of lag issue like this with the 720 . On the other hand , maybe all that advanced planning helps a little if you 're prone to going off course . I 've found that when I pass on one of the directed turns with the 335 , it 's much quicker to re-plot than the 720 . I really do n't know what 's more bothersome : having to wait to get going or having to wait to get my course corrected when making the slightest deviation . The RDS traffic service seems less reliable than the traffic updates I got through the phone data with my 720 . Whereas I could pretty much rely on the 720 's ` Go ' traffic being gospel , the 335 's RDS traffic accuracy was pretty spotty this past weekend on a road trip to San Diego . At one point around San Juan Capistrano , I went about 10 miles in 25 minutes , but the GPS was telling me my road was free and clear . Voice routing is really odd . I never used the spoken street names feature with the 720 , opting instead for one of the more natural-sounding voices simply telling me where to turn and such . The 335 's computer voice has some quirks . Firstly , pronunciation is really spotty . Living in Southern California , I 'm obviously surrounded by streets and cities with Spanish names . All I ask is for some consistency : Either give it the authentic Spanish treatment or completely Anglocize it . You ca n't say ` Loss Ahnheles . ' It 's either ` LOHS Ahnheles ' or ` Loss Anjelez . ' Do n't split the difference . Hearing ` San Joaquin ' is even more painful . On the other hand , the computer lady does say ` San Diego ' as if she 's Ron Burgundy explaining the city 's rich German roots , so that 's pretty funny . Someone else mentioned that the computer voice does n't pronounce the ' 0 ' for highways such as 101 or 405 . Mine does n't ignore the ' 0 , ' she just has some kind of reading disorder . When she wants me to take I-405 , for example , she says `` four-WEST-five . '' Highway 101 becomes `` one-WEST-one . '' The only way I can begin to make any sense of why this happens is that the computer reads the ' 0 ' not as ` zero , ' but as the letter ` O. ' Since ` O ' would be the indicator for ` west ' in the Frenchier parts of Canada , maybe the 335 is trying to show off its worldliness . Of course , that 's just a theory , though I ca n't think of any other remotely plausible reason the GPS would be doing something so dumb . THE VERDICT As I said in the title , I 'm not sure if I 'm keeping this thing . It 's got some quirks I find very bothersome and much of it does not live up to my good experiences with 720 when it was working its best . On the other hand , I 'm not going to find similar amenities at a comparable price and , more than not , the 335 does the basic job for which I need it . I think the question comes down to whether I feel good about rewarding TomTom for regressing their technology , not to mention they lost a lot of credibility as a company with the repeated map downloads despite their ` latest map guarantee . ' Frankly , if I could get the 720 to link up to my new phone , I 'd be keeping that one even with all its issues . The 335 is working well enough to keep me considering it , but it 's far from giving me the warm fuzzies . The next couple of days will find me doing some serious research to see if there 's a better unit to be had without making a huge financial leap . If not , I 'll probably keep it , but I do n't think I 'll ever be too excited about it . \*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\* UPDATE AUGUST 27 , 2010 \*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\* OK , so I ended up keeping it . I 'm still not going to endorse it as a fantastic unit , but I think it 's good enough for most needs if you 're not comfortable crossing the $ 125 -LRB- or thereabouts -RRB- barrier on a GPS . I 've not yet followed the instructions for improving the voiced directions someone posted in a comment to this review , so I ca n't speak to whether the problems I complained about are fixable . Just as a further example of how schizophrenic the voice is , however , I 've noticed that she can do an admirable job with the street name ` Cahuenga ' but ` Sacramento ' is mangled beyond belief to become something that roughly sounds like ` sah-ka-la-mah-kis . ' It 's actually impressive how many consonants are omitted and replaced by others to make California 's capital sound like a Greek shipping company . I now have to mute it when my wife is in the car because she 's not amused with my fascination at how ridiculous most of the spoken names are . Nagging issues continue to be the dim screen , the ' 4-west-5 ' thing , and the points of interest lacking completeness sometimes . An example of the latter was when I was across town and had a sudden hankering for Del Taco -LRB- do n't judge me ! -RRB- . I thought I was near one I knew from when I lived near there , so I put ` Del Taco ' into the search . A half-dozen within a few miles came up quickly , but the one I was thinking of was n't listed . I remembered where it should be and drove the eight blocks or so to get there . Right where I thought it would be , but the GPS did n't know about it . Same thing 's happened with a couple of other chain stores , like Lowe 's . Very odd to me . I should mention that the biggest nagging issue might be the multi-step , analysis mode of replanning routes . It gets ridiculous . Whether replotting to avoid traffic or part of a route , it 's a waste of time and patience for the unit to spend a minute or so analyzing alternatives , present a list of said alternatives with the travel time and distance of each , have the user select which alternative , then go through further analysis on the route allegedly just analyzed . Basically , it 's the equivalent of asking your navigator to plot out three courses , calculating the distance of each , selecting one of the options , then having the navigator re-plot what was already done to create the options in the first place . Silly . Another note I forgot to include initially , despite the ` quick fix ' updates , it takes a minute or so for the unit to pick up satellites when leaving my garage . Also , in one of the first outings with it , I actually lost all satellite signal for a couple of minutes on a stretch of open highway between Burbank and Sherman Oaks . I feel like it might have happened one other time , but , since I ca n't speak to it with specificity , I wo n't ding it too badly here . It 's just odd . AMENDED VERDICT : A decent stopgap for those looking for basic-plus -LRB- maps and traffic -RRB- options who do n't want to drop a bunch of cheddar while waiting for the industry to get it right and put out better systems . Do n't expect too much and you wo n't be too disappointed . "	GPS
I bought this for my boyfriend and it worked okay for nearly 2 years . By that time , the unit did n't hold a charge at all so it had to be continuously plugged in or you 'd have to plug it in and restart it . Also , the maps got very out of date and it would have been expensive to upgrade them - I thought it would be better to get a new gps , but my bf kept using it until its last dying breath , which was rather painful since it seemed like every time he took it on a trip with him , when he brought it back the touch screen would n't work any more . This made it completely unusable , but then after a while it would decide to start working again . The calibration also got off ALL THE TIME , so we 'd start a trip and try to punch in the information and even the security code would be near impossible to type in so it would take forever to unlock it , recalibrate and then finally put in the destination . There is no way either of us would buy a gps again without it having the lifetime maps feature , but because of all the problems I 'm not too sure about buying ANYTHING that is a Garmin . Right now he 's using his iPhone to get driving directions when necessary , which comes with it 's own unique problems and restrictions , and sometimes just his brain which is probably the best if you 're at all familiar with the area you 're driving but also comes with it 's own unique problems -LRB- haha -RRB- but definitely searching for a stand-alone gps unit that will be better than this was .

I ordered this case for my 1450LMT . This case fits my Garmin Nuvi 1450 5 '' touch screen GPS perfectly . But the side pocket is redundant - even USB cable can not be squeezed in . I am disappointed about this part . 	GPS
Only minor negatives . There is n't a selection for FM output and the voice ca n't be changed . Everything else is great . 	GPS
My husband and I just bought a Pontoon Boat for fishing and pleasure . We both enjoy fishing so we wanted to get some good equipment to go along with the boat and this unit was highly recommended . It may even be more than we need right now because it is `` Loaded '' with all kinds of good things . The graphics are easy to read and clear . The depth finder with alarm is very helpful . Even when the sun is shining on the screen , it is clear and easy to read . The sonar gives a real wide angle of what is below us and in great detail . This unit has more maps than we will ever use , but it is good to know they are there should we decide to hit some other fishing areas . Our boat dealer was kind enough to instll this unit on the boat for us and the hookup they used moves it in all different directions and allows us to remove it easily before trailering the boaot home and pop it on when we are ready to hit the water . I do n't see how anyone could be disappointed with this unit . My husband , who is not a `` Techie '' -LRB- has problems running a computer -RRB- has learned very quickly how to operate this unit . We LOVE it . We highly recommend it . When I had a couple of questions , support from Humminbird was excellent too ! 	GPS
I liked this data logger - it has a very solid feel to it , and the connectivity options are good . It does exactly what I bought it for . 	GPS
It does everything I bought it to do , and it does it well . The problem is I PAID for this item , and they have no right to show me ads . Today I accidentally clicked on an ad and it froze up on me . I called costumer support , and they told me my only options are to turn off traffic , or to pay them another $ 50 dollars . 	GPS
I ordered this to take on vacation and received it about a week before leaving . It took 2 hours to download maps through a DSL connection . There is nothing in the book about how to receive the traffic information . Only after calling did I find out that it is received through the car adapter . it did not work . i emailed Tomtom and got a nonsense reply about ongoing issues that pertained to the Live traffic editions . I called and got someone helpful who explained that many of the traffic receivers did n't work . I was told to mail the receiver back and they would replace it . i explained that I was going on vacation in 2 days . They said they would Fedex a new adapter , but I am ready to leave and did not receive it . Very disappointed . Directions are good though . 	GPS
I bought this product for ~ $ 450 in Feb 2007 , and it worked till now very well . We have traveled extensively on the east coast and the west coast and this unit was a great accessory on our trips . But very recently the unit froze , it fails to connect to satellite . Upon further research I found that this is a very common problem and the only solution is to return the Unit for repairs . I am returning the Unit , since I am out of warranty they wanted to charge another $ 50 for repairs but they waived it off . I do n't expect such an expensive thing to get these kind of problems just after 1 year . And it is not just my unit , many other people are getting such problems . Even 660 and 360 have these bugs . 	GPS
This GPS just overcomed my expectations . Size : the 5 inches display is just perfect . And it makes a huge difference when compared with the 4,3 inches models . Map : is very accurate , was impressed with the street pictures it was showing me for the highway exits . Lowlight : while exiting the highways for gas stations , some time the gps would n't realize that it would be faster coming back to the same exit rather then getting a sideway until the next highway exit . interactivity : I think this is han overall problem from gps devices . Their touch screen interactivity is still ver poor compared with other portable devices as tablets and smart phones . If you are used to your smartphone touchscreen , you will be frustrated when trying to navigate in the gps map to findout about the route suroundings , or to set a new destination through the map . -LRB- again this is a problem in all gps I fave used , this garmin one is nevertheless still better than others . -RRB- 	GPS
This is the second underwater camera I have owned . The other one was a Olympus Stylus 770SW . The Olympus died on me in early April . I was thinking buying another Olympus , when I checked out the Nikon AW100 . I decided to buy Nikon because it seemed a better camera than the Olympus Stylus Tough 8010 14MP Digit al Camera or Olympus ToughTG-1 iHS . In the end I am glad I bought the Nikon AW100 . It has been a month now and I am glad to say I made a good choice . 	GPS
I upgraded to the Edge 305HR after owning the 205 for about 5 months and after deciding that I wanted heart rate information to accompany the wealth of information that was already being captured by the 205 . I 've used the new Edge 305HR for about 60 miles of combined road and mountain biking . Like the 205 it captures a wide range of information about your ride - distance , elevation , calories burned , etc. . After following the directions -LRB- which involve wetting the sensors prior to putting on the heart rate monitor -RRB- , I 've found that the heart rate information is incredibly reliable . It is great to see , for example , that on a recent 32 mile ride in a hilly area of Northwest San Antonio that over an hour of the ride was at my target heart rate -LRB- 80 % of my maximum heart rate -RRB- . I upload my info from the Edge and take advantage of the free Motionbased.com account in order to chart my progress . I have experienced ZERO problems with erratic heart rate readings , etc. that have been indicated in previous reviews of this unit . I 'd suggest owners of the 305HR that are having these problems should review the instructions carefully -LRB- making sure that the sensors are wet and the unit is snug on the body ... just below the breastbone -RRB- or contact Garmin to order a replacement . This unit is working exactly as advertised and will provide a great deal of quality information to help you achieve your training goals . 	GPS
I was not sold on the value of GPS , but since the prices have come down , I decided to buy . What a great piece of technology . Used it on a college search trip with my daughter last week . Simply type in the name of the place you want to go -LRB- hotel , school , whatever -RRB- or an address , then press `` go '' and it takes you there flawlessly . When you want food , simply press the food button and all the restaurants in the vicinity pop up . Select the one you want and it takes you right there . It was definitely a time saver and eliminates stress . I picked this model because I wanted to have the voice tell me the name of the street to turn on , rather than simply say turn left ahead . It makes it more foolproof when you are by yourself so you do n't have to look at the screen as much when you are driving . Also , this is small enough to carry in your pocket when you are walking to navigate a city by foot . Very happy with my purchase . 	GPS
I 've been meaning to get this product for a while and I used to borrow my friend 's all the time which is exactly the same model so I know I 'll like this one . The packaging was nice and everything came in the box was new . It 's just the right size to attach to the windshield -LRB- or wherever -RRB- and it seems to endure heat very well too since I 've had to use it a couple of times in extremely hot weather and the GPS was pretty much `` boiling '' after the car 'd been parked in the lot for a while . I also like the recalculating function very much . 	GPS
Recently I got a new car with a long dashboard , which made it impractical to keep using my SiriusXM Starmate 4 's suction cup windshield mount . I did n't want to get a mount for the dashboard and damage it , and my vents are vertical , removing that option . Originally I ordered this for my new phone , a Samsung Skyrocket , which is a big phone -LRB- think HTC EVO -RRB- . I quickly found that this mount not only worked well for that -LRB- making it a life saver when I 'm using the GPS Navigation -RRB- but also for the Starmate 4 , which is bulky , not symmetrical , with 3 wires coming out of the back of it . The mount fits securely in my unused CD Player slot , and the mount itself securely holds the radio itself . Before this I had my radio near my gear shift , meaning I had to look down to use the radio , thus making me an accident waiting to happen . The only slight complaint I have is that the device itself does feel a little cheap , so I am a little worried about the long term durability of it . Regardless I 'm not going to reduce my rating over conjecture that it may not last . Overall I fully recommend this product . I already recommended it to my dad who 's satellite radio ca n't be mounted anymore . 	GPS
I was only trying to find a cable for my existing cf gps reciver , and this product was the same price as the cable , and came with the gps reciver as well ! Well worth the money ! 	GPS
Do n't read this . Watch a video about how awesome this product is . You 'll learn too much about yourself with this watch . ALSO . i feel this watch is better than the 400 series since it picks up gps signals so well -LRB- better than my gps navigator -RRB- . Fun things i 've learned : I skied 43 miles in 4 hours of skiing . My heart rate peaks about 10 minutes into a run . My house is not that far from the garmin place . 	GPS
The product you purchase today may not be what you eventually end up with . TomTom has a habit of `` upgrading '' the GPS with features they think you want . This is done by removing features you have come to use and like . For example , the original GPS I purchased had an auto-zoom feature in 2D map mode , so as you approached a turn , it would zoom in on the map . This is very helpful when two streets are close together . Now this only work in 3D mode which I find useless . They also took away the direction of travel associated with the compass -LRB- N , S , W , SE , etc. -RRB- . Now you have to figure it out by looking at a little blue arrow that spins around . Expect to spend a long wait time on the phone for customer service and have them tell you `` Well , that 's the way it works now '' . 	GPS
Excellent product , did everything it was advertised to do . I especially liked the 3D view , much more followable -LRB- if that 's a word ! -RRB- . It is very easy to use for those who are novices to the GPS mapping world . The only drawback for me was that it was n't waterproof and I intended to use it on a motorcycle . Hence I had to trade it in for a more rugged model . But for those who do n't intend to use it in the rain , by all means this is the product for you . 	GPS
A step up from our previous Nuvi , this Garmin gets it right again . We have loved our Garmin and loaned it out to family members for their trips , and they all said the same . Garmin has a great product , and with `` Lifetime Maps and Traffic '' with this model , we have a unit that will last us for many , many years . Downloading all of the stuff did take a while , but I had already expected that - so it was no surprise . Worth the wait in my opinion not to have to pull over and look through a map or trust someone elses `` turn left by the big brown house '' directions . Thanks Garmin !!! 	GPS
This GPS worked fine out of the box -LRB- trip home ,40 miles -RRB- . I tried to update and get lifetime maps . Never happened . I already have the same model that is one year old that stopped working , I think this was because the internet connection was momentarily disconnected . It never worked since . I returned the new one to Amazon and promptly received a refund without question , I have made many purchases from Amazon , this is my first return , and it was a good experience and I will continue to purchase from them . With lots of looking and comparing models and makes , I decided to buy another TomTom 6 '' Via and it works fine ... 	GPS
Purchased this to replace an old Garmin Street Pilot that I could not get map updates for . Wow , things change in six years . This unit works flawlessly . It comes with lifetime map updates . The traffic hazard feature works great . It is easy to set up and is just what I need . 	GPS
I was pleasently surprised after using this unit . I read some horror stories from some reviewers after I had already orderded it and even thought about canceling . All you have to do is read the manual -LRB- which is short and concise -RRB- before you start and you should have absoloutly no problems . I read some reviews which complained of shoddy construction . Not true ! The maps that shipped with the unit are working great although they are shipping the newest maps to me for free . For anyone that does any traveling in Europe , this GPS comes pre-loaded with all of the European maps as well as Canada and the US . 	GPS
I had been using an older Garmin GPS in my car for some time . It was n't a street pilot , it was a Garmin III . I bought the TomTom Go 300 and ca n't believe how good it is . The TTG 300 includes everything you need : Detailed maps of the USA on the 1 GB SD card with those maps and additional maps on CDs . It has mounting hardware , power cords , etc. but you probably know all that . I am impressed with how well it picks up the satellite signals . My Garmin would never pick up a signal inside the house , and it would often not find one on a cloudy day . The TTG works fine in both cases . The voice is clear and loud -LRB- adjustable -RRB- and you can have it give you a new instruction at any time . It will navigate to an address , a nearby `` point of interest '' -LRB- bank , airport , park , hotel ... -RRB- . And it will find alternate routes if you hit a roadblock or just do n't like the suggested route . You can tell it to build routes that are fastest , shortest , for biking or walking . You can avoid tolls or not . I really like the choices . I think the screen is easy to see and the screen updates are plenty fast . So far the map data has been fairly accurate . Around my home town I notice that some roads that are 3 years old are missing , but I would expect that . The TTG will show you on the road even if the map data is a little off . In other words , it will snap your position to the map road even if you drive off it a little . But if you go far enough off a road , it will show you exactly where you are -LRB- in the middle of field or whatever -RRB- . The menus are very easy to use . Much easier than I expected . You use the touchscreen to pick a city , street , address , and you 're off . It does have the 3-D view of the map which is similar to the view out your window , but I still prefer the typical 2-D map view . You can see more streets that way . The point of interest database has lots of places . I do n't know the exact number of categories but I would estimate there are at least 25 categories -LRB- banks , airports , rental cars , amusement parks , gas , theaters , courthouses , police , hospitals , doctors , dentists , border crossings , zoos , etc. -RRB- And you can create your own categories and add places . I did not find a list of ATM 's , however , and this would have been useful . You can also view the satellite signal strength , battery life , and actual Lat\/Long . I wish you could enter a Lat\/Long as a destination , but alas , you can not . As other people have said , it is very difficult to see in bright sun . At times , I have to reposition it to reduce glare , but this inconvenience would not stop me from buying it again . I have not used the bluetooth feature and ca n't really see myself paying for the subscription feature . Overall , it is a Very Powerful navigator . It comes on when I start the car and goes off when the car stops -LRB- because the cigarette lighter goes off -RRB- . It is very easy to use and very easy to follow . I actually want to take more trips now just to let the TTG figure out the best way to get there . And now my friends all want one . I see Garmin now has a similar model , which I have n't tried . But I would still buy the TTG again if I was shopping for one . Update 4 months later ... I still like the unit and its functions , but as others have said , the map data and routing is disappointing at times . It always got me where I wanted , but half the time it seemed to take me the longer way . It seems to be reluctant to put me on a freeway for short trips , even when it is faster . And I have n't really compared this to another brand , except for the system in the the Audi A4 , which does seem to do a better job : Even knowing what side of the street your destination is on . But that is not an after-market system . So if I was shopping for an after-market system today , I would most likely still buy the Tom Tom for the features , but I would take a close look at the routes is suggests while driving . 	GPS
The Garmin 110 is an outstanding watch for both training and racing . It shows only the important data : distance , heart rate , lap pace , and time . I configured mine in under 5 minutes , and it requires only two button presses to start a run -LRB- one to start the GPS , the other to start the run -RRB- . This watch is much smaller than any of the other Garmin models , and can be comfortably worn as a day-to-day watch . The strap is wide and comfortable , and the screen is easy to see while running . The SiRFstar IV GPS chip finds satellites quickly , usually between 20-60 seconds , and the heart rate monitor connects within a couple of seconds . The included charger allows charging from a wall outlet or a computer , and the cable is used to transfer your runs to the -LRB- ... -RRB- website . GarminConnect is easy to use and shows your runs in great detail . The replay feature is easily the coolest part of the site . Runs can not be reviewed on the watch , so GarminConnect is an integral part of the way this watch functions . I 've used my Garmin 110 with Windows Vista and Windows 7 . Both work equally well and were easy to set up . I should note that the other extremely negative reviews are misguided and should be discounted . The primary complaint about this watch is the lack of `` current pace '' . The Garmin 110 does not show current pace by design , so anyone who buys this watch expecting that feature will be severely disappointed . The product description on Amazon is sorely lacking , but a small amount of research would have revealed the features of this watch . The several 1-star ratings are misleading , and do not reflect the quality , size , and functionality of this watch . The Garmin 110 is an outstanding GPS watch for anyone who does n't need all the bells and whistles of the more advanced models . This is also the first GPS watch that is small and light enough to be worn day-to-day and actually looks like a watch . 	GPS
My wife is a personal assistant to a commercial real estate developer and a great portion of her time is spent running errands in areas she is not familiar with . She had told me of some close calls she had in the car , as a result of traveling slow to read street signs or address numbers . On other occassions she was delayed when she had to stop to phone the destination and ask for directions -LRB- one of the few who will not talk on the cell phone while driving -RRB- . With the Garmin c340 she is able to give all her attention to driving , keep pace with the flow of traffic , and not experience delays to stop and get directions . She said she has reduced her errand time by 30 % , and reduced her auto expenses by 10 % . I was a bit frustrated when I found the unit came with a quick start manual and you have to go to the Garmin web site to down load the full instruction manual . My wife was not concerned as she has never read an instruction manual for anything and usually tosses electronic gadgets to me to figure it out for her . This thing is so complete and simple to use you do n't need the instruction manual . I had to show her twice where the on\/off button is -LRB- one of the most prominent features on the side of the unit ? -RRB- and then I went to download the manual . She kept coming into the office to show me what she had learned to do with this thing . By the time I had the manual downloaded , on a dial up line , she had figured everything out so I never read the manual ! I originally started looking at the GPS because a friend , who is a electronics wizard and writes computer programs for video games , had a TOM-TOM . He came to visit about two weeks after we received the c340 and my wife was showing him all the features and he sat there with his TOM-TOM and kept saying , `` Mine does n't do that ! '' He called a week later and told me that he knew I was a little disappointed because my wife took the Garmin , and tossed me her new road atlas , and he offered to sell me his TOM-TOM cheap because he replaced it with a Garmin c340 Streetpilot . The review , I read on Amazon , which informed that this unit tells you the street name of exits gave great influence as to my selection of this unit as my wife travels to California for her employer , and we have relatives in San Francisco . We now travel there and navigate the traffic like one of the locals . In summary : I researched every GPS I could find for three months before purchasing and the c340 is the most powerful at the affordable price ; this unit will pay for itself in reduced driving expense , at today 's gas prices , in about 6 months if you run daily errands ; insurance companies should give reduced rates to drivers who have a GPS as it allows you to focus on your immediate surroundings and not impede the regular flow of traffic .

Does a great job protecting my Garmin Nuvi . It 's compact size makes it a perfect addition to any glovebox or purse . 	GPS
Was sold as an accessory but it was n't needed because there was one already included in the GPS box . Returned it . 	GPS
I really enjoy using this device . Entering run information is easier on the computer than manually in the watch . Getting to check out my pace and HR encourages my runs . 	GPS
I purchased this mount for my 2006 Pontiac Vibe . I 've tried all the other `` non-permanent '' mounts out there - suction cups to the windows , something that sits on a heavy base . Over time they all ended up falling down , and never `` stuck '' like they were supposed to again . When I bought my new Iphone , I wanted something that would enable me to easily access my music while in the car -LRB- or the functions of Siri hands-free -RRB- . The Mountek MT5000 does the trick . I have had no problems , and it 's been the best purchase I 've made for my car . I 'm easily able to access my phone , and the mount stays tight . Because of the way my dash is set up , the mount does cover the LCD display of my CD player , but since I 'm mainly using the phone for music , that 's not much of a problem -LRB- only a little annoying if I want to change radio station presets or see what FM frequency I 'm on , but that 's not Mountek 's fault -RRB- . I also have to mention that their customer service is top notch - I had a question about the mount , and I received an email immediately . Seriously , if you are looking for a way to mount your phone , and you do n't mind covering your CD player , consider Mountek . It 's worth every penny . 	GPS
I bought to use in my adventure in Patagonia -LRB- trekings in Toores del Paine and El Chalten -RRB- with my girlfriend , and it survives all weathers -LRB- and help us survive too ! -RRB- . 	GPS
I love everything about this unit , except that on a cloudy day or when near trees it takes way too long to lock onto satellites . Often , I 'm to my destination while it 's still hunting . This is my second Garmin . The first , an I-5 , was the same way . The factory nav system in our other car never has problems finding itself like the Garmins do . 	GPS
I bought this GPS for a friend , and he lend me for the first week of use . It works great , helps you a lot chosing the exact exit lane , so the lane assist is an amazing innovation . 	GPS
Good GPS . Pros Big Screen display Loud and clear voice . Even street names are clear Quick satellite connection Cons Bit convoluted menus Poor touch sensitivity for screen Very poor mount . Comes of easily -LRB- the unit from mount not the mount from dashboard -RRB- Overall Good GPS with no major issues . Update : The mount became really worse . I dropped the GPS many times while mounting or operating when it is mounted . Started disliking a good GPS for very poor mount ! 	GPS
TomTom support supervisor first told me that I had a defective example so I exchanged it . Two weeks and several hours of my time later , I was told by TomTom support that the problem is that this model is incompatible with Mac computers . Who knows and frankly I do n't care at this point . Nothing in TomTom 's manual or Amazon 's sales materials to indicate maps and firmware can only been downloaded through a PC . I 'm just irritated that TomTom apparently has a license through Amazon to waste my time . This is the first and last TomTom product for me . 	GPS
The display is nothing like what is pictured on the web site . The sharpness , black and white , just is n't there . It does not come with a printed use manual . It does have a manual on a CD if that 's the way you like to study a use manual then go for it . 	GPS
This product is a great product and reasonably priced . Overall experience with the Amazon and the Garmin is first rate . 	GPS
I used to have the Tomtom One , with a 4.3 '' screen . I got this one for the larger screen . The software has many improvements , but is essentially the same . What I really like is the red light camera notifications the map update service and the traffic info . If you liked earlier Tomtoms , this is a great upgrade . 	GPS
"The Garmin nuvi 1450 GPS works great . The directions are clear and easy to follow . We used the index of attractions while on vacation and the unit is easy to program and very user friendly .

I bought the 305 from Amazon over a month and a half ago . I was to run a 5K the next day and hadnt tried the forerunner before . I went ahead and wore the forerunner for my first 5k just to see if it would be able to perform and I was pleasantly surprised at how well it did ! This is by far the best purchase I have made . I use it for my runs everyday and upload my data to connect . -LRB- ... -RRB- as soon as I come home . Its so much easier to not wonder or guess how far you ran and what your pace was since the forerunner does all the hard work for you . I have been able to enjoy my runs and improve my endurance a lot more by tracking my heart rate and slowing down when it touches 170 or higher ... I have never lost the satellite signal and I run mostly in areas covered with trees . I turn the forerunner on and then do a a couple of minutes worth of streching before I start my runs so the forerunner has already located the satellites and is ready to go . I can not imagine running without it and I highly recommend anyone who is into running or biking to get one . The only thing I have a complaint about is that hitting the power button to turn the backlight on is a pain ... I wish there was an easier way to turn the backlight on ... I use the backlight regularly since I do most of my running at night . 	GPS
I purchase this Garmin Forerunner so I could track in detail , all the aspects of my runs . Heartrate , distance , pace , elevation gained and lost etc. . I LOVE IT ! Only thing I can see as a small drawback is the short battery life . Otherwise all is good , just put it on its plugged in cradle when not in use there should be no worries . 	GPS
Let me begin by saying that as a straight up GPS , this unit works fine . I have owned it for just over 6 months and it gets me from Point A to Point B flawlessly . The problem is that I upgraded to this unit from an older Garmin GPS specifically for it 's traffic feature . Since the day I purchased this unit , it has \* never \* -LRB- and I mean this literally -RRB- alerted me to traffic in any way that helps me to avoid traffic , and I live in a suburb just outside of NYC where traffic and alternate routes abound . Every once in a while it will alert me to `` traffic ahead '' as I am driving into traffic , and have already passed the turn I could have made to avoid it . And I 'm talking about major highways , not just backroads blocked up by a car accident . What 's perplexing about this is that clearly the technology exists to detect traffic real-time . Google maps does a very good job with this . Why Garmin has not been able to incorporate this adequately into their products is a mystery . So essentially , I through away money on a second GPS . Bottom line : save your money and buy the cheaper non-traffic update model . 	GPS
Simple setup , and worked without a hitch with my canon ip4300 . Had a mixed environment of windows 7 and XP computers printing in less than 15 min . 	GPS
I bought the Garmin 7200 for the big 7 '' screen to use in our motor home . I did a lot of searching and reading forums before deciding on this one . The text to speech is the greatest as it tells me to move to the right lane more than enough advance of the exit or turn , very important driving a motor home or any vehicle for that matter . If I make a wrong turn it directs me right back to the my route . My wife is the navigator and says it is the best addition to the motor home . She says it is a big stress reliever . We can go off the scheduled route and get right back on in the shortest time without worry . The POI 's are wonderful , National Parks , gas stations , stores almost anything . 	GPS
I have nothing but great things about the Garmin RINO 120 . The Navigation is good to go . Some people complain about how much more work it is compared to a dedicated GPS model . Well , when you have to combine the radio and the GPS , there is bound to be some compromise somewhere . The radio feature is great . I got scambling security function , different beeps and tones for different parties , and the GPS location works with the radio . My negative opinions is about the computer to unit cord . . It is a old style nine pin serial port , but the more expensive model have the USB to unit cord . Ca n't they just update the lineup so all of us have the newer connection . Another issue is the software . . All the new maps are not compatible with the RINO 120 , but it is compatible with the new RINO 520 . Yes , I know they still sell the software that is compatible with the RINO 120 , but it is n't updated since 2000 , and I would hate to find out the road is no longer there ... That kind of thing ... So overall , it is a good product , just that it needs some updating ... 	GPS
Purchased this for my wife , who had traded in a vehicle with built-in navigation for a new vehicle that did not offer a built-in option . I 've also had several vehicles with built-in navigation , including BMW , Mercedes-Benz , Audi , and Lexus . From a performance perspective , the Nuvi 350 works every bit as well as the built-in units and at a very low price -LRB- comparitively -RRB- . The only `` nits '' that I can pick are : 1 . -RRB- I wish the navigation announcements could be louder - they can easily be drowned out by radio or CD , and unlike built-in systems the Nuvi ca n't interrupt the audio . 2 . -RRB- The power cord should be on a retracting reel , like many accessories for laptop computers . As it is , the long cord is a little clumsy . But overall , the Nuvi 350 is a winner . 	GPS
Just about impossible to get on the lens on the screen of a GPS -LRB- Garmin Oregon 550t -RRB- perfectly . By the time you put it on the lens is dirty with fingerprints . Perfect is about immposible . 	GPS
Purchased the c330 , and it arrived the day before our trip to So . Florida to visit the grandkids . It only got lost once in Alabama on SR-76 , but I believe that problem has been corrected in the software upgrade that is free from the Garmin site . The product is better than I thought , and is perfect . Visibility is just fine in bright daylight , and it 's a Godsend at night . Every little twist in the road appears on the screen . It switches automatically to nighttime mode , and back to day operations . Worth every penny ! 	GPS
The unit purchased does the job , however listing a bit misleading as it is not actually like the Garmin Original as there is no fuse . Other than this good product so far . 	GPS

While I love this technology and I received it as a gift , there are so many more Garmin on the market now that are blue-tooth compatible , let you change your direction when street is closed but the Garmin does n't know it -LRB- construction or obstruction -RRB- and that are easier to carrier . The Garmin service is great . I learned to not leave it in the glove compartment because of the heat but it 's not easy to carry . Still , Garmin repaired and sent back to me quickly at no charge -LRB- still under warranty -RRB- . Try one of the nice pocket models . I travel enough that this is not convenient and I live in a warm climate so if I ca n't leave it in the car , it 's awfully difficult to carry every place I go . -LRB- If someone 's breaking in my glove compartment , I have bigger worries and insurance will cover it . But carrying it is like carrying a glass baseball in your purse . -RRB- 	GPS
It took a lot of research for me to finally find a GPS CF bundle -LRB- hardware and software -RRB- for a Dell Axim X5 . Some how just buying the one Dell pushes was not good enough and here some of what I have learned ... The Pharos units covers the audio input on the top of the X5 ... why is that important ? Well if you are using it in a car and what to use a device to boost the sound of your turn by turn directions -LRB- ie . a power PDA car holder -RRB- ... Well you would be out of luck . The product has a lot of kinks , it has trouble with re-routing and over all is a good start but for the same money you can get something that is much better . Look into a Haicom 303 ... As far as software a lot of it is personal preference - look at the website of the software makers and see if you like the look of the software . Call Pharos and talk to them ... I think you will find that they are more about good marketing , slick name and packaging than a mature product . Like other reviewers I can not see any difference beteen the PF022 and the PFD22 -LRB- for Dell -RRB- other than something for Dell . Check ` Buy GPS Now com ' for more in depth information about GPS and software products . Amazon has a good start but there is just not enough imformation - like EXACTLY what comes in the box and any thing else -LRB- ie cords -RRB- that you will need to make it work with your PDA . Since you can not return software once you have installed it - you need all the INFORMATION you can get to pick wisely . 	GPS
We been using this GPS unit to measure our horse rides . The display is a bit difficult to read while riding . The documentation clarifies very little and is not in depth at all . Scrolling through the various modes can be tedious . It does keep track of avg speed and max speed . We 've yet to figure out how to easily start a new lap . They could do a lot more to make the interface and documentation more user friendly . 	GPS

Pro : This unit is awesome . It 's literally a pc in your car . Radio , GPS , IPOD\/Iphone and bluetooth works well . Ca n't beat the price compare to other in-dash GPS . Touch screen has a good sensitivity . Con : I do have a problem with the microphone for the bluetooth . Currently checking with the seller if there is a setting for it to adjust the volume or if it could be bad . There are a lot of icons for programs . I would prefer a simple menu options on the display for ease of use . 	GPS
I did so much research before buying this product and saw a couple of negative reviews , but I think they must have just had a defective product because mine is wonderful . It is the first navigation system I have ever owned and would definitely buy from Mio again . The features are great , the wide selection of map color options are great , and the volume is appropriate . My only disappointed moment was when I realized that I would have to buy a separate memory card to save MY POI and stuff . But since I got such a great deal on it -LRB- $ 175 -RRB- , I can still afford to buy a memory card ! 	GPS
I purchased one of these almost a year ago , product has been excellent . I have used the mount on my dirt bike in very rough terrain going very fast , no problem . I have had this mount on my mountain bike in Moab , UT no problem . I ride my dirt bike one to three times a week over rough trails with this mount and no problems . When I go to a WMA on my mountain bike and ride for a whole weekend I never have a problem . I think the people where the GPS fell out after two small bumps and such did not install the mount correctly . I never write reviews unless a product real impresses me and this one did . I have purchased two so I do n't have to keep switching hardware between my dirt bike and mountain bike . This is a great product . 	GPS
I really liked this item - it was easy to put together , is very sturdy and works with both my GPS and smart phone . Unfortunately the dashboard of my car is curved - and in sharp turns the AutoDashmount falls right off . I think if my dashboard had a flat spot , it would be perfect . But as it is , the best I can give it is 3 stars . 	GPS
Great product and quick delivery !! Given as a present and they loved it . Planning a long trip soon and ready to put to good use . 	GPS
This unit does everything Garmin says it will do and does it flawlessly . Battery draw down time is very exceptable even in cold weather . We have gotten it soaked with snow and ice . The first day we had it I hid twelve gifts in deep woods in a twenty acre area . I set waypoints for each gift and erased my tracks . Even in fast falling , blowing , and drifting snow my kids where able to navigate to all twelve gifts within an hour . What a blast . I strongly recommend adding Garmins Mapsource City Navigator for on road adventures . The unit gives extremely accurate on road directions -LRB- in print-no voice -RRB- and seems very up to date at least for our area in Wisconsin . I also purchased the optional external antenne for my vehicle , which is perfect . The unit even receives well next to a window without the external antenne , at least in fairly open areas . Even in severe weather and cloud cover it seems accurate within about twelve feet . I really ca n't say enough good about this GPS . It is slightly more expensive than some of the lesser units , but WELL WORTH the cost . 	GPS
Someone wrote a review saying this did n't work in their Scion xB . I purchased this for use in 2008 Scion xB with the factory upgraded stereo -LRB- the one with the animated graphics -RRB- . Installation worked fine for me and it fits my Samsung Droid Charge in an Otterbox case . You 'll have to remove the bottom bracket and slide your Charge down a bit to use the micro USB port when it 's in the Mountek . It does n't fit my TomTom XL 340s GPS by itself . It may fit if you attach the factory supplied suction ring to the back and use that for the Mountek to hold onto , but I no longer have that and therefore could n't test it out . 	GPS
The GPS unit is impressive , but mine kept dropping the satellite signal and recalculating to a different destination . I tried downloading the latest software from their site , but it did not fix the problem . Amazon is replacing the unit and I will see if the new one works correctly . 	GPS

I just intalled the WGPS606 . It works fantastically as a wireless bridge and print server . Installation was straight forward and easy . I now have two printers , a Canon i950 and an HP 1210xi , accessible on the network . I had a Dell running 24 hours a day so that my family could share a printer . Now all computers will sleep in the household . I should save enough money in electricity to pay for the print server . 	GPS
I was concerned this mount would not be very sturdy , or it would damage my CD slot , but I was pleasantly surprised . It is very sturdy and does n't have any give at all . It fits easily in the CD slot and it does n't seem to put a lot of stress on it . I also own the Arkon mount , which I 'm also very happy with . However , the face on this mount is quite a bit smaller than the Arkon version , so if you plan on having it in your car all the time , this one will probably look a little nicer . As other reviewers mentioned , it is kind of a pain to release the arms because the button is on top behind your phone , but you really should n't be messing with it much unless you are stopped , so it is n't that big of a deal .

I 've used a Garmin 500 for quite some time in my cycling . My main issue with the unit was that I considered the display to be less than adequate . I have tried all manner of adjustments to the contrast , but alas , my cheap Cateye Strada mounted alongside the Garmin shines brightly in all lighting situations - unlike the Garmin that cost many multiples of the Cateye computer . Stupidly , having not seen an 800 , and with idiotic assumption that Garmin would assuredly upgrade the display for something North of 600 bucks -LRB- for the model with extras -RRB- , I had my dealer order me one . Surprise today on my first useage - it 's worse than the 500 if that 's possible . The only lighting that shows the display clearly is when sunlight shines directly on the face of the unit . For most of my ride , I turned the back light on to illuminate constantly which helped when riding in the shade , but of course just a 3 hour ride used up half the battery . I think the worst display is when riding in sunlight not directly shining on the unit - probably the most common situation . I would almost love this unit had Garmin found a way to offer a bright , easily read display . I say `` almost '' in that I stupidly thought that perhaps Garmin would listen to users prior to releasing a new model . I have discussed the fact with them that I thought that with all of the heart parameters that can be read in display windows , a very important -LRB- to me -RRB- reading is the reading of maximum heart rate . Of course like the 500 , that can be finally read in the comfort of your house after you stop the activity , reset the computer and then read the results of your activity . I want to be able to read it anytime I want to on the fly . I had planned to put this on my new time trial bike , but alas with the considerable effort of an all out TT , and the sometimes tunnel vision that results from such a drastic effort , I would guess that the 800 will be all but impossible to read . Will Garmin EVER get it right ? I now believe that the answer is `` NO. '' Between these two units and my Garmin 305 watch -LRB- the most frustrating piece of gear ever -RRB- , apparently I am as bad as them - I do n't learn very easily . __________________ Sandy Scott 	GPS
The GPS works well , except that there is no instruction given on how to mount the GPS on the dashboard , as California law disallows GPS on windscreen . We had to figure it out ourselves , after a long time , and also end up breaking part of the bracket . 	GPS
I have used the optional nav systems that are a $ 2,000 option in most cars , and the Garmin c340 is by far the easiest and best performing nav system I have ever used , at a fraction of the price . It is so user friendly that all I had to do is turn it on and go . The amount of data pre-loaded into the unit is staggering . My relative that lives on a private road with only three other homes was in the system . The other systems I have used could only get me to an intersection , about a mile away . My only regret is that I did not spend a little more to purchase one that is bluetooth ready . I am thrilled with my c340 and purchasing it on Amazon.com was easy and fast . 	GPS
I had a Magellan previously but the screen on this unit is much larger and easier to view when driving . 	GPS
I have owned this unit for a couple of years , and I have upgraded the software recently as well -LRB- rev 5.4 -RRB- . I would not buy another GPS of this model , and I have doubts about Magellan products in general after my experience with this unit . My reasons are a little different than other reviewers . On my unit , the electronic compass is unreliable , and has to be recalibrated every week . This is particularly so if it is used around the electromagnetic environment of a vehicle , and whenever batteries are changed . Most importantly , there is no warning that the compass needs to be reset . Therefore you might find yourself walking along a heading that is completely inaccurate , without realizing it . One of the key issues when using a unit like this is trust , and in particular trust when in the ` nearly lost , semi panic ' situation that we all hope to never find ourselves in . My unit falls short often enough that I can not trust some of the data I am getting . In an effort to improve reliability I have set the compass orientation to `` GPS course '' , so that when the compass fails , then at least the direction of movement on the map will be reliable . However I find it disconcerting when ` heading ' is so dramatically incorrect . Evidently ` heading ' is data derived from the internal compass , and the unit is happy to give data that is inconsistent with it 's own data from the GPS direction . For example , when walking quickly east , the unit will always accurately show my movement on the map as east , even when the electronic compass has lost calibration . However on the next screen the ` heading ' will be labeled as a ridiculous 221 degrees , or some other bizarre number , even when the unit is pointed directly along the eastward line of movement . It seems to me that it should be easy for the unit to be programmed to show a warning to the user that the compass is giving inaccurate data , since the data from the unit is in conflict with itself . If such a warning were reliable , then I would at least know when the unit needs recalibration . Sadly , Magellan seems to have made no effort to accomplish this . Without an internal check of the electronic compass I would n't trust this unit to get me out of trouble . In some ways I should have anticipated this . Clearly , a GPS should not be relied on for simple information as to which way north is . It is much better for pinpointing your exact location , ultimately the most important data that a GPS offers . Therefore if I ever need to buy another GPS I would get one that does not have an internal compass . It would be nice if Magellan were to offer a software upgrade that allowed the user to turn off the internal compass , so that battery use would be lower and data would be more reliable . Spurious data is worse than no data at all . 	GPS
This is my second Garmin GPS . My first one was several years old and needed to be updated but there was a charge for updating . In checking out the new ones I discovered this one has a lifetime free update , so I decided to purchase my most recent Garmin . The 5-inch screen is so easy to see and read . Extremely easy to program and use . Having traveled quite a bit I have found this GPS to be very accurate . Would recommend this GPS to anyone . Love it ! Also , I can not say enought wonderful things about the service I received from Amazon . When I first received the new GPS it had a couple of problems but I need it right away so I just made do until I finished my traveling for a while . When I contacted Amazon about the problem -LRB- eventhough it was way past 30 days -RRB- they could not have been nicer or more helpful . Received a replacement the next day . You do n't get service like this just any where . Amazon is my number 1 shopping place and has been for qite a while . Thank you Amazon . 	GPS
This is my third Tom Tom and is a replacement for one I lost . I have always been happy with the features and accuracy of the arrival times . The routes selected generally are the optimal route as best as I can tell . The battery life is not great but I only use it in the car and it is always plugged in . 	GPS
I 'll cut to the chase -- you wo n't find a better hand-held GPS for the price . I did considerable research prior to purchase . The 450 is the best for the money -- accurate , touch menu driven -LRB- more menu options than most will ever need -RRB- -- very user friendly , however , because of the numerous features , I recommend spending a few hours with the unit early on , so you will get the benefit of all of the features . Do a google search to find websites that provide downloadable maps for free that are compatible with the Garmin and have topographical features -LRB- another reason to buy the 450 rather than the 450T -RRB- . You 'll end up with better topographical maps for less $ $ . I 've purchased 3 other GPS units in the last few years , including 2 Garmin nuvis . After the initial satellite search which takes a minute or so , the succeeding power-ups lock-on to a full compliment of satellites in seconds -LRB- often , literally 2-3 seconds -RRB- . I 've never experienced such an `` instant ready '' with any other GPS unit . Bottom line : as good as they get ! 	GPS
I 'm impressed by the accuracy and sensitivity of this equipment . I went for a jog with this recently when I just receive it . The distance tracking is great with very good accuracy . It can be configured to stop the timer once you stop or jog on the spot due to various reasons like traffic light \/ road junction waiting time . Just this distance , pace , and timing feature of this watch is already worthwhile for any runners to invest in . In the past , I have always enjoyed running on the trackmill machine in the gym just because its able to give me the distance that I have ran . But now , you can do it outdoor and enjoy the scenery while monitoring your distance , pace , calories burned , etc. . Great ! 	GPS
It is true that it does not work great near skyscrapers . Other then that , it is great . 	GPS
540S WTE did not progress beyond the start-up screen . 3hrs of troubleshooting and reformatting failed to cure . Hours holding on the telephone to Tomtom to get an RMA number . Three email series of QandA from Tomtom . Lousy , lousy customer service . Still stuck with the unit . Come ON Tomtom ! 	GPS
The mount attaches to both my bike and my 60Cx fine . I have no fears of it falling off . The problem is when I hit a bump , the gps turns off . Yes , this is a road bike , not trail . For example the bump when you go onto and off of small bridges causes this problem . I think you have to buy a gps made for biking . 	GPS
First of all , I do like this tablet . It is not a flawless , polished piece of technology , but it is pretty good for the money . If you want a flawless tablet experience , spend $ 700 on the iPad . I love that this has USB ports and TWO SD card slots . The ethernet is also nice since large downloads , like GPS offline maps , can take a long time over the wireless . I use this to check my email and surf the internet when I 'm sitting in bed or out and about . Its much lighter than any netbook which would have been my other choice . Some notes on my experience so far . The Cons : - Get a screen protector , the plastic scratches easily . I found some that are made for it on ebay , search for `` superpad '' -LRB- it 's the same thing -RRB- - Sluggish interface response , you can find some youtube videos floating around , that is not the video being choppy it is the interface , use your finger nail or built-in stylus for best touch results - `` cheap '' feel , plastic can be bent out of shape , etc. . - Visible screen flicker when holding in vertical position - Speakers are not very good at all , any kind of noise in the room makes them basically in-audible - display is not visible at all in sunlight , even on brightest setting . - GPS requires external antenna , some have complained about GPS lock on time , I live in the northeast and it does it by the time I can exit the GPS settings and get the GPS test program running . - Shipping did take awhile , but was well packaged and shipped right away , its just coming from China . - I have locked this up once or twice , but its hard to say if it was an android app , or the OS it 's self . The Pros : - Cheap ! - 2 SD card slots that support 32 GB - 2 USB ports , the case I found on ebay has a small usb keyboard built in which is awesome when typing an email on the road - Ethernet port for when there is no wifi - Lots of apps in android market place . - Some folks have been successful flashing this with Ubuntu Linux which I would love to do , but if you mess it up you have an odd shaped paper weight .

This product is amazing ! It is so easy to use and so useful especially when running long distances and you do n't know how far you 've been . I would recommend this product to anyone ! 	GPS
We purchased this unit for visiting in Texas on about 6\/1\/06 . It has the Version 8 maps with the matte screen . Overall , we 're very satisfied but it 's not perfect . We had to send the first sample we purchased back due to a dead pixel -LRB- I 'm not shelling out $ 600 for a flawed product -RRB- . The second model arrived flawless . Since then we 've made the following observations . Pros - Talks to you with the street names , saving having to look at the screen as often . How much is your safety worth ? - Attractive form factor , small enough but yet large enough - Good battery life - Saves gas and time , and reduces getting lost , even around your own town . - Display , we are pleased with the daylight and nightime performance . Cons : - Seems pricy for what you get - Startup time -LRB- acquiring satelites -RRB- seems excessive on a fresh power up . - Dozens of roads in the internal map software were not accurate causing much confusion when driving . This is a software map issue , not a hardware issue . Maps were not accurate . 	GPS
Bought the 1300 LM for the life-time maps and loved how easy they update . Sorry Amazon , Best Buy had it for $ 139 , great deal ! Adding custom POI files was simple as well . Actually got this for my wife as a birthday present and she loved it . Would recommend this to anyone interested in a GPS . 	GPS
i love this telescope . you should know this thing is a monster when it comes to weight . I do n't have a designated place for it , so i have to move it in and out of the house , it can be a pain in the a \*\* . but the optics so far are amazing . light gathering power is amazing . it is pricey but if it keeps performing the way it has , it 's worth it . i took some photos of the moon and jupiter with it , i will post them . I am an amateur amateur photographer and stargazer , the photos are not as good as some taken by some of the more seasoned folks . Reason for 3 stars ? well , star align was the reason why I chose this particular telescope , and it does n't work . I have looked up and read a lot about this problem , and unless you have a very big sky where the weak GPS system can get signal through , you wo n't be able to star align . hills around your house , mountains near by or tall walls around the yard will hinder the star alignment , BE AWARE ! otherwise , spend the green and enjoy : -RRB- 	GPS
My husband had a Garmin GPS which he used for vacation travel and hiking , but I could never take the time to figure out how to use the thing , so I printed out my step-by-step instructions from Maps & Streets or Mapquest . And I have to admit that I put myself in danger more than once trying to read the next turns while driving . My husband likes his gadgits , so when his Garmin went kaput , he went into hyper research mode . He bought the TomTom even though his Mr. Fixit buddy repaired the Garmin . He loved the pre-loaded maps and the long battery life . He downloaded his own POI data and when he was messing around with it , he contacted user support and received good technical support within a day . I was n't happy he bought another GPS when I was n't thrilled with the first one , but I let him have his toy ... I was converted when we had to go to a wedding of a distant relative in the NYC area . It routed us the same as Maps and Streets , but without any effort . We easily were routed to restaurants and gas stations along the way . We stayed at a secluded state campground and it even had the campground 's `` roads '' in its database ! When we came back home , several bridges were washed out from severe rain , and we easily re-routed to avoid the closed roads . Just be careful not to use the `` shortest route '' feature in rural areas , because you may need a 4X4 ! We also let our friends borrow it for a few days while they were visiting from out of town . They were skeptics too , until they used it . They know what their getting for Christmas this year ! This thing is so easy to use right out of the box . I really like the feature of letting you know what turns are coming up and that it calibrates when to tell you and at what volume depending on your speed . I highly recommend this for the Mr. Gadgits and the people like me who just wants it to be easy to use right out of the box . BJ 	GPS
Excellent product . Happy I purchased it . The product works great . Screen is easy to see . Voice activation is a great feature when driving . 	GPS
I ordered the Bad Elf before I had heard of the XGPS150 . A few days after ordering I ran into a guy at the airport who was using the XGPS150 . After chatting about it for a few minutes , I decided to cancel my Bad Elf order and order the XGPS150 instead . Amazon said it was too late to cancel the Bad Elf . I got the XGPS150 and used it in the car and airplane and LOVED it . It is external and connects via Bluetooth . Today , I decided to try the Bad Elf that had arrived a few days after the XGPS150 . First off , it turns off when you close an app that requires GPS . Then when you reopen the app , the Bad Elf has reacquire the satellites . Very annoying . The XGPS stays on and connected . Switching between apps is seamless . The other issues is that the Bad Elf sticks out the bottom of the device you connect it to . It is easily knocked out and I believe it would be easy to damage your device . In my hour of using it , it got knocked out once . At that point , I firmly decided I would return it . I was going to keep is as a backup to the XGPS150 . No more . I 'll be ordering a second XGPS150 . 	GPS
We really love the RoadMate 1700 . We have a 2009 Buick with a navigation system in it and it is very incompetent compared to the RoadMate 1700 . We have an RV that it is great in , but you will need the long window mount for an RV . We also have a Jeep Wrangler we use it in . We even use it in our Buick instead of the built-in one . It far exceeds our expectations . We expected it to be about like the Buick 's system , but I can not stress more how much better this is . 	GPS
My plan was to only use this GPS unit when I was charting out new courses , but I 'm finding myself always strapping it on now ! It 's less cumbersome than I expected and works very well . Out of about 20 runs , it lost contact with the satellite once for about one mile - otherwise it has been faultless . It takes about 3-4 minutes to initiate contact when turning on and you need to leave it someplace still while it is finding the satellite . 	GPS
The dual USB car charger for iPad ordered from Battery World WORKS . That 's something right there . And it charges quickly as well as doubly . 	GPS
I 'm impressed and relieved knowing there is a 2yr warranty on this Garmin GPS watch I purchased . At least if something goes wrong it can be taken care of and I received the papers in the mail shortly after purchasing the Garmin watch . 	GPS
Made me a much more relaxed driver especially when I saw it could adjust for changes in route . The only perplexing part is that it seemed to get confused in some parts of Manhattan - I knew how to get where I wanted to but it did n't on several occasions . 	GPS
About a week after I purchased my Handspring Visor I bought the Magellan GPS . My first reaction was `` the instructions for the batteries are wrong ? '' As you know , in most AA battery devices , there is a spring on one side and a piece of metal on the other . Generally you put the flat \/ negative -LRB- - -RRB- end of the battery against the spring and the small knobbed end of the battery against the battery . And in most of these cases the batteries will be in opposite directions to each other . This is where the GPS is unusual . Although the batteries do face in different directions , on ONE the batter negative\/flat side is against the spring , and on the other the spring is against the knobbed -LRB- + -RRB- end . Not only is this counter-intuitive , it just looks wrong . OK , so even though it was against my better judgment , I put the batteries in as directed and it worked . However , within one day -LRB- less than 2 hours use -RRB- it froze my Visor whenever I connected it . I replaced the batteries and the same thing kept happening . I called tech support and they essentially told me that `` there is something wrong with the GPS , it acts like that when the batteries are low '' but I tried 3 sets of new batteries and got the same problem . They said I could return it for a refund and I sent it back , only to get an e-mail that was a duplicate of the original shipping order . I thought they had received it and where shipping it back to me ? So I called them again and they said that they have a problem with their refunds confirmation , but that they did receive my return and I would be credited . Another problem - the startup instructions states that the CD-ROM included has an online manual - BUT that is only readable by PCs - NOT FOR MACS . I called tech support and they mailed me a printed version of the manual . I could not believe that they could not be bothered to make a PDF version of the file that could be read by any computer using a free Adobe Acrobat reader . The files were easy enough to identify and load into my PDA but I did not find it easy to use -LRB- this was before the manual arrived -RRB- . It is not intuitive and definitely more difficult to use than a map . Individually any one of my above-mentioned complaints could have been tolerated -LRB- even sending it back for repair\/refund -RRB- but all together I thought if I am having these many problems so soon after buying it , how will it be after any length of time ? I have never purchased any other electronic device that had more problems within the first day of purchase . DO NOT BUY - wait until it there is an improved version that stores the batteries properly -LRB- I suspect that is where the power connection failed -RRB- and that has a better , easier to read -LRB- and universally readable by any machine -RRB- manual .

This navigation system works amazingly well . I used it to find my way from Maryland to Montreal . There are several different highways to navigate and Streetpilot was flawless in getting me into the correct lane to make the change . Driving around Montreal was much easier and I especially appreciated hearing the correct pronunciation of the Streets in French . You will love the Streetpilot . 	GPS
I had nothing but problems with this card . It started with BSOD 's while web browsing . It appears to have been an AMD driver issue which was fixed by using 3rd party uninstallers -LRB- AMD 's uninstaller does n't work well -RRB- and reinstalling CCC . Then I started experience random system freezes while gaming that required a reboot . For me , this happened only in Skyrim and Shogun 2 . Apparently Tera and other games also have problems . The whole HD 7xxx line appear to have issues with Shogun 2 which Creative Assembly are trying to fix -LRB- check their support forums -RRB- . In the midst of all of the system freezes , I started getting RAID corruption and reinstalled Windows 7 . The freezing problem persisted even after a fresh install . Sapphire recommended a 3rd RMA . AMD told me that they were aware of the problems with the HD 7xxx line and Shogun 2 and Skyrim . They said that because the drivers are new the card was bound to have compatibility problems , and that I should be patient and wait for the next driver release . These problems may occur only with certain builds . Or it might be the case that they produced a lot of defective cards . Whatever the case , I am back to my old card which is working flawlessly and I will be buying a different brand next time . I will say this , if you can get the card to work . It was great . Witcher 2 , BF3 , and Crysis 2 looked amazing with this card -LRB- there were some flickering issues -RRB- . However , because of the problems I had , I ca n't recommend it to anyone . The 2 stars are because of how well it ran some of my games , but the problems I was having were just unacceptable . Note : I am rating the product , but I give Amazon 5 stars for their amazing customer support . I requested an RMA at 7pm and received my new card the next day without any hassle . I will be buying all of my computer components from Amazon from now on and will be recommending that all of my friends do the same . They are second to none . The card was one of the worst experiences I 've had with a product . Amazon customer support was one of the best customer support experiences I 've had . As of 5\/11\/12 , I would also like to add that with the advent of Nvidias GTX 670 , you can expect the prices of this -LRB- $ 360 -RRB- and all ATI cards to drop pretty soon as the GTX 670 undercuts ATI 's cards in a performance per price scale .

Running this in my HP dx2200 with Ubuntu 11.04 It does the job . It takes a little load off of the RAM and CPU without requiring a PSU upgrade -LRB- I have a 250W -RRB- .

Giving a 3-star rating as I 'm fairly certain I just have\/had REALLY bad luck . 1st card would gray - or vertical lines-screen at random , usually at idle , but sometimes under load , regardless of drivers , clocks settings , BIOS switch positions , even in another computer . I contacted Amazon for a replacement , and they cross-shipped me one STRAIGHT AWAY . However , the second one not only had the exact same issues , but it 's cap\/choke whine was 10x worse than the 1st card . So , 2 bad cards in ... No more . Returned . Now , let me clarify\/go over a couple things . 1st of all I 'd like to make note of how GREAT Amazon 's customer service has been . It 's unfortunate they 'll soon be force to charge sales tax in my -LRB- and others ' -RRB- state -LRB- s -RRB- , as I now would choose Amazon over newegg , any day . Do n't get me wrong , Newegg is great still , but Amazon 's really taken the cake in my book . Even with the problems , they 've earned a loyal customer . Even if there 's a minute price premium here , I may still choose Amazon . Secondly , I am not the only 7970 buyer that 's had this same issue\/type of issue . I know of several others on at least 1 tech forum , overclock.net , that have had the same or similar issues , with other brand 7970s . It appears the issue may be BIOS -LRB- firmware -RRB- related , or Voltage Regulator related . I do not know the exact cause , but I really do not blame Amazon , AMD , or Sapphire directly for this . While I will probably get a 670 or 680 from the competitor -LRB- 1 or 2 specific application optimizations -RRB- , please do n't let this deter you from getting this card . I honestly believe I just had poor luck , and as the 7970s drop in price , they 're getting a better and better deal . Thus , I give it a mid-point 3 stars . I had issues , twice over , but Amazon 's making me right , and I honestly believe I stumbled upon a statistical improbability . These cards OC well , perform incredibly well for the price point , etc. . 	Graphics Card
This GPU is so efficient compared to the Nvidia GPUs -LRB- especially my GTX280 this card was replacing -RRB- . It 's more powerful than my old GTX280 but it draws much less power and generates less heat . At first I was a little hesitant to migrate from Nvidia to ATI just because it does n't have `` physx '' . But after playing some games that support `` physx '' , I actually do n't notice significant difference that I could notice immediately in fast-pacing games . One note that , the driver is a bit buggy in Windows 7 . Under low stress , the bottom of the screen would flicker when scrolling -LRB- ie . when browsing the net -RRB- and it 's somewhat annoying if the computer is used for web browsing regularly . However , if the card is under high stress -LRB- ie . playing games -RRB- , the bug seems to disappear . Given that I installed this card in a gaming machine , I do n't feel this as a big problem . But people who use their computers for web browsing , or light office work , might want to consider this too . As far as Asus DirectCU II cooling system , it 's huge -LRB- even larger than the card itself -RRB- , but it does cool the card very well . It stays in somewhat low RPM even under load so it 's not too noisy . Temperature is in the 30s under low load and get up to 70-ish under full load -LRB- card was overclocked to the maximum as well -RRB- . Bottomline , other than the driver itself , I could n't complain about this card . 	Graphics Card
Do n't get this product . It messed up all the software that was on my computer . Also it could n't even do a simple power point presentation . 	Graphics Card

Bought two cards to Crossfire . Nice graphics , very clean and clear . Not to bad on fan noise , but the heat coming off these cards are blasting me out of my office . Very hot at about 226F , during moderate graphics usage . I am not sure that these cards are suppose to work that HOT ??? In any case , I like the price for the performance . Just ca n't beat that , but they could have included the bridge connector . Now , if I can just manage that heat . 	Graphics Card
Just got this monitor adapter cord to hook up my second monitor . My computer only had one VGA port . I went to bestbuy and was told I would have to spend upwards of $ 100 to get a cord then an adapter for the cord in order to hook up dual monitors .

Definitely recommend this product if you do n't have two VGA ports for a dual monitor setup . 	Graphics Card
I tried to play Phoenix R\/C Pro Flight Simulator and Realflight G5 on my P4 , Windows XP SP3 , 2.0 MHZ , 2.5 GB Ram , PC with no look . Everything really slow and unplayable .

Realflight G5 takes up some memory but Phoenix R\/C Simulator runs with no problems . This is a great deal and can save you several 100 's of dollars on a new PC . 	Graphics Card
My eVGA nVidia GeForce 7800 GTX 512 , once an OEM-only benchmark smoking $ 750 + -LRB- in 2005 dollars : -RRB- -RRB- graphics card , has finally reached the point where new games are n't playable at all , and new , entry-level cards are beginning to outrun it . It 's only taken 6 years . : D If you are looking at this product , you are likely aware that the only thing it shares with the GTX560 Ti is the name . The rest of the hardware is a 570 with one additional multiprocessor disabled -LRB- possibly 570 chips with a core that did n't pass muster -RRB- . Great reviews of the underlying hardware are available from all the normal hardware testing sites , so I 'll focus on the eVGA and Classified portion of this card . I have dealt with eVGA hardware personally and professionally for going on six years now , and can find nothing bad to say about the company . Which is remarkable , coming from me . You get the feeling , owning their products , that they make the kind of products they themselves would like to own . They stand behind their hardware , offer awesome warranties -LRB- 5 , 10 or lifetime , depending on the hardware -RRB- and provide all the overclocking and monitoring tools you need . The Classified card is large ; it took up all of the available space in my Alienware full tower between the drive cage and the PCI case slots . So much so , in fact , that I had to remove my IDE cable for lack of a place to run it , and both cards had to be inserted at an angle , lined up with the DVI ports and rotated into place . Seated and slotted , there is just enough room for a SATA cable to lay between the drive cage and the end of the card . I installed the cards in my eVGA X58 SLI 3x motherboard , pulling out my 7800 . Though the card instructions recommended installation in the 1st and 3rd PCIe slot , I wanted dual-slot X16 bandwidth , not some hobbled x16\/x8 monkey business . Knowing better , naturally , I placed then in the first two x16 slots . The fan side of these cards , with the red stripe , is bowed out , and when they were placed in the adjacent slots , I found that they actually pushed on each other , causing an awkward sort of lean in the plastic bezel . But they worked . So I fired up my system . Installation of the drivers was unremarkable , a couple of reboots later I was up and running . The problem I immediately noticed was brought to light by eVGA 's own precision software . At idle -LRB- as idle as Aero gets , at least -RRB- GPU2 was sitting at a comfortable 37C , while GPU1 sweated up around 50C . Launching a game with SLI brought the temperatures up . The cooling system in the card will rev the fans up to keep the temperatures from exceeding 70C , and GPU2 hit that . GPU1 went much farther than that . I consider water-boiling temperatures to be too high for my comfort . Playing an older game like TF2 did n't cause a problem , other than my concern that one card was 30C hotter than the other . Running a DirectX11 demo program with tessellation utilized the card fully , however , and my system soon rebooted itself . After the second reboot in two days , that little nagging `` install in X16 slots 1 and 3 '' kept coming up in my mind , and so I did a little research about the impact of x16\/x16 versus x16\/x8 . I found that the experts noted only a performance different of 5-6 FPS in most games -LRB- and we 're not running below 60 -RRB- . The SLI bridge makes up a lot of the difference , it appears . So I moved GPU2 to the third x16 slot and now both cards stay about the same temperature all of the time , I have had no problems playing games . With the notable exception that my mouse-tracking in some games has improved so much that I have to adjust my FPS habits to compensate for the changes . So the Classified cards are huge , they need a lot of juice -LRB- 6 pin AND 8 pin on each -RRB- and I see no possible way to actually run three of these in SLI without replacing the heatsink with a waterblock to get rid of the heat . That being said , they are built for overclocking , and for the price of one of these cards , you can speed it up to compete easily with much more expensive choices . And the eVGA logo on the edge of the card lights up white . Shame on eVGA for not printing in their installation manual : `` No , stupid , I said use the 1st and 3rd slots . I do n't care what you think you know about bandwidth as it applies to SLI , do what I say before you burn your house down . '' I 'm hoping for another 6 years with this next generation of eVGA graphics cards . 	Graphics Card
What can I say ? Custom cooler with custom PCB , TOP edition card known for quality . Buy this card now . You wo n't regret . Only negative about Asus is the RMA process . 	Graphics Card
Bought this card for a small form factor computer . While the card itself may function great , it is certainly not a low profile card , and requires a full size slot , which are not available in my small form factor computer . I 'm not sure why that it is called Low Profile , then ! Perhaps `` Low Profile Ready '' is the key , here , but there were no half-size brackets , nor would the card have worked with one . More a review on the manufacturer 's labeling , than anything else . Even a sticker on the box says it 's Low Profile . 	Graphics Card
I am vary happy with this card and I am planing on ordering another one , You can not beet it for the money 	Graphics Card
I did a lot of research before deciding on this card . The main things that made me decide to buy it were ; 1 . High quality components . This card is not a cheap version of a 6950 , it is a solid card with Japanese made capacitors -LRB- the best -RRB- and great construction . 2 . Quiet ! This card is 100 % quieter than my last card , a 4890 . My wife loves it that my computer can not be heard in the other room now ! 3 . Cool ! This card runs extremely cool . The two fan configuration does an excellent job keeping it cool -LRB- and is also the reason it 's so quiet , the fans can run at a lower rpm and still provide more cooling than a single fan -RRB- . 4 . Fast fast fast . This card , while not a reference design -LRB- for unlocking shaders -RRB- is still a very fast card . It blows away every game I throw at it , and I can FINALLY run crysis at max settings ! One thing to remember about reference vs. non-reference cards is that when you unlock the shaders , you only get a 3 % performance boost , and that is at the cost of a hotter running and louder card -LRB- due to the single fan -RRB- . Bottom line , if you are looking for a great clard that is fast , quiet , cool , and has some overclockability , this is the one to get . 	Graphics Card
Product came in with all parts and cables . Installing was easy . Monitor came alive as soon as I turned it on . Upgraded from a 128mb card and what a difference . Brought new life to my old Dell desktop . Price was fair . I can now watch shows on CBS.com in full screen and no lag when it hits HD broadcast . Play facebook games with no problems . Only bad thing is that it would not upload new drivers from disk that it came with . Got latest drivers online . 	Graphics Card
I initially bought this product as my budget PC 's graphics card . I was not impressed . The card had only a 4.4 and 4.6 on Aero and Gaming Windows Experience Index . However , this card can easily handle Bitcoin mining at 19.2 Mhash\/sec . The $ 50 GT 430 I bought easily got a 6.7 on the WEI and handled games much better . However , it was 2x slower at Bitcoin mining , though that 's not really all important to me . My advice : Stay away from this card and get a GT 430 or better . 	Graphics Card
This is a great video card . Plays all games on max settings without even breaking a sweat . The 670 GTX 's are out and about in full force , but if you can swing a few more dollars to get this , I would . I am not saying anything bad about the 670 's ... they 're a good chip . And the 690 GTX 's are a dream . WOW . I 've been a PC gamer since the early 90 's and this card will be great for me , for the foreseeable future . Happy gaming all . 	Graphics Card
Install was straight forward and easy . Had it now for a little over a week and seems speedier than the board it replaced . Does n't get hot so passive cooler works fine . Good bargain for those of us not into gaming . Works great for streaming HD video . Check dimensions before purchasing , some dimensions on some products are incorrect . Make sure you have space so cooling fins fit . 	Graphics Card
Running with : i7 2700k ,16 gb Corsair , Crucial M4 . This thing just rips every game I play to shreds . I can play SC2 with graphics maxed out on 2560x1440 resolution and still get 100 + FPS . Best thing about this card was I ordered it early and got it for only 499 ! 	Graphics Card
Having this card is like having too many girlfriends . Lots of fun but very expensive . Like all the other reviews I read this card runs every game I have at 1920 x 1080 at max settings without a stutter . It is quieter at load than the 6970 it replaced and gets many more FPS at higher AA settings . I love the way it throttles the frequencies according to demand to save energy . The fan on mine has never gone above 60 % to keep the GPU at 80 C degrees or below . My older games stay in the 40 's . I run most of my games with vsync and not seen the FPS drop below 60 on any at max settings . This card is a winner ! 	Graphics Card
I bought this card so I could connect a third monitor to my PC and it has only a single spare PCI slot If you have extra PCI-E slots then buy a card for those as these PCI cards are far more slower and they do not keep up with the speeds of the other cards when used as an extended monitor and when you 're moving stuff between them . For example playing a video on the monitor connected to this card slows the browser movement and other screen refreshes on the main screens and I guess that is expected . For a card which allows a third monitor to be connected to browse or checkout pdf 's this is great . If you want to play the xplane or similar game to get a cockpit feel with three monitors this is not the right card for the job . 	Graphics Card
I ordered two of these cards to run in SLI . First issue I was not aware of is that Intel X79 chipsets are not currently supported by Nvidia to run at PCIe Gen3 speeds . OEM distributed drivers allegedly allowed PCIe Gen3 speeds but official Nvidia drivers do not . I believe this will be fixed rather soon and is a mute point for the most part . Next , the current Asus GPU tweak software -LRB- as of 3June -RRB- appears to be causing many users issues to include a Red Screen of Death -LRB- RSOD -RRB- . I experienced these issues and they were resolved immediately by uninstalling the Asus software . The bigger issue is that overclocked 670 's in general at this point are like playing the lotto . I ordered two and one runs great while the other could not complete any benchmark at factory speeds without crashing and will be returned . Before figuring this out , I read many forums with users reporting the same situation . Underclocking the card will make it stable , but I paid for a card that is guaranteed to work at a certain overclock . The good stuff ; The card that runs , runs great ! At factory fan speeds and under full load for half an hour -LRB- prime95 & furmark -RRB- I see temperatures around 66C . With a 4.7 ghz Intel i7 , I get 9500 Marks in 3dMark11 . I have many newer games if anyone wants specific benches for certain games . I have not experimented with overclocking with either card as most reviews indicate the card is pretty much maxed out as is . I am switching from an ATI 7950 -LRB- Gigabyte Windforce -RRB- . The 7950 at a max overclock is slightly faster than the 670 GTX in my experience . However , AMD\/ATI suffer from many driver issues and games do n't typically scale as well in Crossfire as they do in SLI . Of note though , the AMD card does appear to render higher quality graphics at default settings . I would not recommend switching from a AMD 7000 series card to a Nvidia 600 series card but anything else will certainly be a huge step up . One star deducted as the QA of the cards is not great at this point . 	Graphics Card
I am using this video card for about 10 days now , running BF3 on max settings , tested with Crysis DX11 + HD Texture pack and Skyrim with HD texture pack . I can say that the card is good , handles these games on maximum settings but it 's not better than my Radeon 7970 , I think it 's the same level . Both machines have i7-3770k@4.4 . Maybe with new games using physx I will see some improvement . I can recommend it over the 7970 bcz of the lack of bugs\/inssues i have sometimes with the 7970 . Looking for another 680 to get SLI or some thing stronger from Nvidia next months . Right now , this videocard alone is enought for all games i like . 	Graphics Card
I love the card , it 's dead silent and runs absolutely everything like a dream . For multi-monitor setups , it might n't be enough , but for everything short of that it 's a blast . 	Graphics Card
I read negative reviews on anything first and foremost before buying anything . I ordered this and it is day one but it is working fine . My suggestion to people who said it did not work . A cd comes with it , install it , follow the instructions and you will be fine . Also make sure that your video card is not a cheap POS because although it is a USB hook up the drivers communicate the information from the UBS port to the Video card . so I got news for you if its not working your card probably does not have enough memory to support it . I have two monitors hooked up with different resolutions on each one and they are working well . Also do not plug into a USB hub and expect it to work . My hub does not work for anything except keyboard and mouse hook up . I suggest this because if you follow the instructions then there should not be an issue . 	Graphics Card
This is a great video card ! it produces very good quality video in games and photos . this video card comes with a 2 year warranty . it also comes with 1-DVI to VGA adapter and 1 - s-video cable this video card is also Windows 7 compatable . I have Windows 7 Ultimate Edition and it works great ! if you use this with Windows 7 you just have to download the newest driver for it from the EVGA website . I would recomend this video card to anyone who wants or needs high quality video . 	Graphics Card
I know it is n't RTM yet , but if you are looking to use this on Windows 8 , I would wait . I tried the supplied driver as well as a newer driver on their website and both just set my machine into a bluescreen reboot loop . I set up a support ticket with them , I will update with the results , but based on my google searches , the same thing happened when Windows 7 came out and they just blew it off until they were ready to release a driver . I did n't want to give 2 stars as I think the item is probably good for supported configurations , but I also ca n't give it a high rating since it is providing me no value . I wish I could have just left the rating blank and just gave feedback . \* Update after a week or so of usage . \* So , I formatted my laptop and went back to Windows 7 to try this in a supported environment . There are some pretty big issues when going back and forth between sleep mode\/docked and undocked that all go away if I uninstall the driver for this , but cause a bunch small issues when this is in installed . It often leaves me at a black screen and I have to open and reclose the laptop to get video , or if the card isnt plugged in when I dock , it seems to try to capture one of the other monitors on the dock -LRB- there are 2 -RRB- and causes artifacting , needed a undock and redock . I asked StarTech the process to get a refund as it is just too much to deal with on a computer I actually use for work and they told me to reach out to Amazon -LRB- fail -RRB- . I am not going to go through all of the drama of fighting for a refund over such a trivial amount , but I definitely wont be recommending this to anyone , which is unfortunate as the other developers -LRB- I write software -RRB- where I work were very interested in picking one up if it worked .

I now have two Acer 2216 's -LRB- 22 '' widescreens -RRB- both running at 1680x1050 , one from my new Samsung laptop 's VGA port , one from a USB port through the StarTech to the other Acer 's VGA input . Setup was performed exactly as required by StarTech , and the screen came immediately to life upon the restart , but at a lower resolution than the monitor can support . I spent some time on the various onscreen display controllers -LRB- the Samsung has both a motherboard controller program and a separate `` video card '' controller for faster video when needed , plus the new controller program installed by the StarTech -RRB- . It took some effort get to the right buttons here and there -LRB- use the StarTech 's -RRB- , but both screens are now at their optimal resolution , side by side on my desk , in extended desktop mode -LRB- a 44x16 '' desktop , beginning to look like the bridge of the old starship Enterprise -RRB- . Better yet , I 've not had to reset anything each morning after full shutdown -LRB- or hibernate -RRB- since this was installed , including removal of the laptop for use elsewhere . The laptop works normally on its own , and the big screens come back perfectly when I reconnect them . As another reviewer indicated , it 's great to have a complex product do what the manufacturer promises . A note , not a problem for me but worth mentioning : the monitor seen through the StarTech has a slow refresh rate . Not noticeable in most normal uses -LRB- text , web , emails , photos -RRB- , but too slow for video . Video remains fine on the other big screen . -LRB- Note on March 1st , after a month + of use : The drag this system imposes on my USB controller causes it to miss mouse clicks often - it 's necessary to hold the mouse button a bit longer than usual to get a response . I 'm running a pretty fast i5-processor laptop ; others will also have this problem . It 's enough of an irritation to drop my review to 4 stars . I still recommend the device : it allows me to have the two large hi-res screens running , as discussed above . -RRB- 	Graphics Card
Very good card for the price , got mine for 159 was on sale so couldnt pass up . Like i posted above this does not come with free dirt . Didnt really care for the game so didnt make a difference to me . Some things that are not listed on here , newegg , or the sappire website are : Core Clock-900MHz Stream Processors-1120 Stream Processing Units Effective Memory Clock-1050MHz Everything else standard with the HD 6870 . Currently have mine overclocked to 925 . When in use gets 50-60c -LRB- with no added cooling unless you add some water blocks which of course will lower the temps -RRB- . Havent really tested how far the card can go , but with the games that i do play on a constant bases : Counter Strike Source : 60 fps max everything Dota 2 : 60 fps max everything build : cpu : fx 6 series mobo : gigabyte ud3 ram : 4 gb corsair 1333 psu : corsair tx 750 	Graphics Card
While the stand alone power of this card is very competitive , the real potential in this card lies in its SLI scale-ability . Eyefinity on three monitors is also a nice brand feature compared to PhysX . It is supported by more titles . 	Graphics Card

this card performs wonderfully , great graphics with no problems . the fan does make a bit of noise , but nothing that 's bothersome . it is quite a large card , so be prepared to have room in your case for it . also , it does take two hookups to power it , so make sure you have enough . otherwise , money well spent !

Could not get it to work with windows 7 out of the box . Was hoping this card would be an upgrade to my current GeForce 5600 and give my 10 year old PC some more life . - Was able to get it to work after reinstalling my old card then uninstalling the drivers and cards before installing the new card . 	Graphics Card
Received 2-3 days before expected . Took about 15 + minutes to install and download software . The change in antique PC amazing . Grreat price , service and EVGA is amazing . After reading many reviews , EVGA seemed to be the best choice . I agree ! 	Graphics Card
I bought this video card to replace a 128MB card in an 8-year old Dell Dimension 8400 mid-tower desktop . Hardware installation was a snap - 3 minutes , start to finish - and the OEM software installed with no issues onto my Windows XP SP3 platform . -LRB- Tip for novices using XP : When you boot your machine after installing this card , the Windows hardware wizard will try to install drivers for you , but do n't let it . Click on cancel when the wizard starts , then mount the OEM disk into an optical drive . If the OEM disk does n't automatically play when you rack it up , click on Start , My Computer , right-click on the drive containing the driver disk , and then select Autoplay . -RRB- Note that I am not a gamer , nor am I trying to drive multiple monitors or an HDTV with this video card . That said , I 've noticed an immediate upside in performance with this card , particularly in its handling of streaming video and MPEG files . My initial impression is that this card is a good value for dollar and that I 'm going to be very happy with this purchase . If not , I 'll be back to update this review . 	Graphics Card
No complaints so far . Easy to configure . I 've heard this model runs cooler than the other 6950s , mine is idling at around 40-50 degrees according to hwmonitor so I do n't know if that 's true . Includes a code for a free copy of Dirt 3 that you can activate on Steam . Not my kind of game , but it 's a nice bonus . I prefer the Sapphire utility to Catalyst for overclocking . Basically , this is probably the best 2 GB 6950 you 'll get for the price . At $ 250 after rebate , it 's a hell of a value . Very easy to install . Feels sturdy . Requires TWO PCI-E connectors from power supply though so make sure you 're prepared . . 	Graphics Card
Bought it not too long ago and have been running CODMW3 on it . Works very well and have had no problems at all . 	Graphics Card
First the card : Replaced an outdated but surprisingly capable Radeon HD 5830 that could still play everything near full at 1600x1200 . But near was no longer enough so I sprung for the `` great deal '' in the 680 's little-by-1 \/ 2 '' brother , the 670 FTW . Quotes on great deal for the fact high end cards seem to jump $ 100 every 2 years . It is performing well as expected -LRB- see Tom 's Hardware or such for benchmarks , it runs everything maxed -RRB- but did not overclock well at all . The CPU is unstable at more than a 10MHz offset in Precision X and the memory gets about 100MHz . I 'm not running it overclocked because there is no need but I wanted to know how much headroom it had , and it 's little . It is louder than the Radeon but not loud . The card sits 3 ' from my head so that was important . My case and CPU fans are rated 17-19 db so normally the hard drives are the loudest thing , this is a bit louder , maybe 25-30 db . If you have air conditioning on in your room you wo n't hear the card though . Now the concern : EVGA has cut down it 's warranty at the knees , from lifetime to 10 years to 3 years in 2 or 3 `` generations '' of cards . They no longer cross ship . They no longer pay shipping to them . Instead they want to sell you extended warranties and - get this - shipping protection in case you return your card . Yes they will let you pay now for shipping your dead card later and the only way it would be worth it at their prices is if the card died a few times . The warranty also requires an involved registration process to be completed within 30 days . Needless to say this throws up red flags as to what kind of failure rates their cards are getting nowadays that they will no longer stand behind them . If XFX still made Nvidia cards I would have promptly exchanged this for a Black Edition with a double transferable lifetime warranty that they actually honor . There it is , my gripe is one common to most industries - cost cutting means support cutting - and EVGA has moved into the `` value card maker '' realm of support . Of course , the card is priced lower than factory overclocked offerings from Gigabyte , MSI and Asus , so maybe `` value card maker '' is exactly what they want to be now . Just know what kind of backing you will get . 	Graphics Card
No problems so far , everything works at it should ! I 'd definitely recommend it to anyone ! The price was good too ! 	Graphics Card
Bought this to replace two Sapphire 512MB 4870 cards . The decrease in noise and temperature is unbelievable . I bumped up Skyrim from very high settings to ultra high . Much smoother . Love the performance increase . The only downside that I 've found is an intermittent black screen flash . Seems random . Happens any time , browsing , vpn , gaming . Does n't happen often . Happens when the card 's speed toggle is flipped to either setting . Hoping it 's a driver issue . Going to hold out for the next version to see if it 's fixed before talking with support .

I purchased this video card , but it was not compatible with my system . This is a 3.3 volt which WILL NOT work on my 1.5 v. The specifications do not give you that detail . I 'm sure it 's a great product , but just an fyi , to check your volts . 	Graphics Card
This card was easy to install and setup had very good quality Video . I have a old Dell P4 computer and Windows 7 did not support the on board graphis , this video card allowed me to install Windows 7 and run Windows 7 on this old computer that only had a PCI card slot . 	Graphics Card
So here 's my story . . I recently purchased a 27 '' HP IPS monitor -LRB- zr 2740w -RRB- that has 2560x1440 native resolution -LRB- which is fantastic BTW -RRB- primarily for photo editing . I previously had a 1080p monitor , but I had to zoom in too much to deal with my rather large images from my Sony 24mp SLR camera . The GTS 240 video card in my Dell XPS 8000 computer drove the new monitor ok , but struggled quite a bit trying to run any games -LRB- Crysis -RRB- at native resolution -LRB- or even 1080p -RRB- . So I decided to look for a new card that would 1 -RRB- fit inside my Dell 2 -RRB- play games at 1440p . I researched online extensively , and initially chose a GTX 560 ti card . But I discovered reading various forums that this card would n't drive 1440p very well . I then was leaning towards a Radeon 7950 or 7970 , but the dimensions of those cards would be extremely tight in my case . So that led me to the GTX 670 . Most sites recommended the 670 FTW edition from EVGA , so that 's what I ordered . The card arrived quickly -LRB- thanks Amazon Prime -RRB- , and I installed the card along with a new Corsair 800w power supply . It was a tight fit for sure , and I had to move my hard drive to a different bay to make it work . The card was at least an inch longer than the GTS 240 that was in it before . Besides the tight fit , installation was fairly easy , and loading the drivers was painless . Once I got my pc running , and loaded Crysis to test it . Wow . Pretty damn cool . The GTS 240 gave me choppy frames rates at 1080p -LRB- medium -RRB- . The GTX 670 gives me super smooth gameplay at 1440p -LRB- high settings -RRB- . I ca n't tell you how good a game looks in 1440p , but it definitely makes me feel better about dropping money for my new monitor . Then about 15 minutes into the game , my computer got white ` spots ' all over the screen and froze . WTH ? I had to do a cold reboot . Later on , I ran the ` OC Scanner ' utility to run some benchmark tests , and again my computer froze . In total , my system froze 5 times in 2 days , and I was starting to get frustrated dropping over $ 400 for video card that freezes my very reliable computer . I read more forums online , and discovered that several people have had this issue with the 600-series cards . I started regretting my purchase , but kept researching online for solutions or ` fixes ' . So far I have uninstalled the Nvidia HD audio and 3D drivers , enabled software control on the fan in Precision X utility -LRB- its not enabled by default -RRB- , and set the fan curve more aggresively . I do n't know if this permanently will prevent freeze ups , but I did manage to play Crysis for almost 3 hours yesterday without issue , so hopefully this works long term . If it does , than this card is absolutely fantastic , and I could n't ask for more graphically speaking . If I continue having issues with the card , than the card is not worth the headache . I 'll give it a 5-star rating -LRB- based purely on performance -RRB- for now , and update the rating if the issue continue . Hope this helps ! 	Graphics Card
"I got the Sparkle GEForce card as a part of an upgrade to my nearly 8 years old 2.5 Ghz P4 Compaq Presario S6000V tower system to Windows 7 Pro in addition to a <ahref=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000RO3BPA/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/177-1923968-0756350""> Western Digital 320 GB WD Blue PATA 7200 RPM 8 MB Cache Bulk\/OEM Desktop Hard Drive </a> . Installation was relatively easy other than the issue of the heatsink which proved manageable . Once installed I went into the BIOS settings to set the Card as the default graphics card . I then proceeded to set up windows & and install the latest version of the nvidia geforce drivers on it . In my opinion the probable reason I hhave ad few if any problems with the card was due to my installing it in a clean slate software environment . So far the its been a year and a half since I did the graphics upgrade which has proven to be fairly capable for the main uses I 've put it to -LRB- File server , print server , media storage , plus occasional netflix movie system . Currently it 's linked to dual monitor setup using 23 '' Samsung SyncMaster 2343 at its full native resolution -LRB- 2048x1152 -RRB- and old Dell 15 '' -LRB- 1024x800 -RRB- . I have so far had very few problems or issues with the video card other than 2-3 driver crashes . Given the age of the system I have not been inclined to push it to the limit on graphics but I have been able to play some fairly highdef videos with few if any problems .

Pros : - Quiet fans . They are pretty much silent when compared to my case fans which are quiet . This is my first silent card . This is my biggest selling point . I love it . - Cool . Under load this card never exceeds 65C . - Backplate . Not a big deal . Looks nice . Adds a little more stability . - Higher quality components compared to a reference card . For example , compare the heatsink on this one to a reference heatsink -LRB- look up pictures with google -RRB- . - Fast . My card boosts to 1280mhz out of the box . The base clock on this -LRB- 1058mhz -RRB- is faster than I was able to overclock my reference EVGA 670 -LRB- which also had annoying fan noise -RRB- . Cons : - My card has no headroom for OCing further or it crashes . My max clock is amazing however and it is stable . And I wo n't complain , in fact I am delighted to get the speed that I get . - GPU Tweak Software by Asus is n't so great -LRB- I never bothered to use it -RRB- . - Pray that the card does n't fail because then you have to deal with ASUS 's customer support . They make great products , but their support is terrible -LRB- to say the least -RRB- . Other thoughts : It is a fact that some pre-overclocked cards are unstable because Kepler gpus boost so high . I think ASUS is asking too much of some of these GPU 's -LRB- perhaps because of a supply shortage -RRB- . Not all can stably boost to mid to high 1200 's . If you are unlucky and do not get a good GPU , it can be unstable and crash under load with certain applications . Its all the luck of the draw . Mine is terrific and exceeds my expectations so I ca n't give it anything less than 5 stars . Some people report `` Red Screens of Death '' RSOD 's . It is my understanding that the problem is cause by certain GPU monitoring software . If it happens try different software -LRB- for example EVGA 's precision X -RRB- . Asus updated their GPU tweak software and we 'll see if it fixed the RSOD problem . I imagine that some of the problems with instability that people are experiencing may be a bios issue or a problem with a certain batch . We can only hope that ASUS addresses this in the future . Amazon 's return policy is the best . If you need an RMA because of an unstable clock , get an exchange through them . Underclock your card until the replacement is ready . Then see if you are lucky with the second one . Or you could always get the non-overclocked ASUS non-top 670 and overclock it yourself . I probably would have gone that route if Amazon had them in stock at the time I purchased this one . In short , if you get a stable card , you will have what is , in my opinion , the best 670 card on the market right now . If you get an unstable card , you could be frustrated -LRB- keep your old video card around for awhile in case of problems -RRB- In my case , I am very happy . UPDATE : My card still runs fine . For those who are worried about issues or are having issues . ASUS has released new BIOS on their website that supposedly resolves problems with the cards overclocking too high . That should alleviate some concerns about problems with the card . 	Graphics Card
Awesome card . I have had no issues with it period ! It 's a little overpriced on Amazon . But they were the only one 's with it in stock so I shelled out the extra -LRB- ... -RRB- bucks .

I did have to buy a new power supply -LRB- mine was a 250 watt -RRB- but the product arrived quickly and installed painlessly . I bought it to run Starcraft 2 , and it runs on Ultra -LRB- or extreme , I ca n't remember -RRB- it runs on the highest setting without a hiccup . The card is somewhat large due to the fan assembly -LRB- it will take up the room of two cards -RRB- but it only needs one slot to plug in to . It also needs a 6 pin power connector from your computer 's power supply . It does not come with a converter . 	Graphics Card

I bought this graphics card for a circa 2004 Dell 4600 . After 5 years of heavy use , I blew a couple of capacitors on the original OEM card -LRB- as evidenced by their domed tops -RRB- . The sound they made when they blew was a fairly loud , short burst of air sound -LRB- sort of like a beat of a drum -RRB- . Anyway , this new card was easy to install and works better than the original ever did . I can run at a higher resolution and the LCD screen seems clearer . 	Graphics Card
My first gaming build was gonna have a MSI 560 Ti Hawk . But by the time I saved enough to build a new rig , the 600 series was out .

The EVGA GTX 590 Classified is extremely powerful with sharp crisp and smooth rendering . This card generates great frame rates , even at 2560x1600 resolutions . I was very happy with the initial purchase and elated with the second card . The first card install went without a hitch . This encouraged me to try a Quad SLI configuration and I purchased a second card . Strongly recommend running the EVGA Precision application when in Quad SLI . Set the cards to a higher fan speed for the air cooled version . I would recommend the water cooled Hydro Copper version and installing a water cooling system now given the Quad SLI system I built . The cards become power crazy and the longer you run them , the hotter they get . In a single card system the fan noise is hardly noticeable at all and considerable quieter than previous video cards I 've had . The system runs great on the Gigabyte EX-58 Extreme installed in a Cool Master HAF-X case . Running two cards in Quad SLI mode has its down side . Make sure you have a high watt power supply and battery UPS , I have a 1200W Silent Gold Pro 80 + Gold but only a 1500VA UPS . There were times the UPS hit 900 watts of load and tripped the shutdown procedures -LRB- this was after more than 6 hours of continuous use at high resolution and high graphic load , not over clocked -RRB- . Read the FAQ on the support site when the blue screen shows up . There is a potential conflict with HD audio using the same resources . The support site walks you through the steps and you be back up and running in no time . The tech support reporting system replied in a few hours with the pointers to the support FAQ . Great card . For dual use , consider switching to water cooled versions . 	Graphics Card
The GTX 590 is supposed to be the fastest thing on the market . I have found that it seems to be a good card but installing and set up is a not plug and play . You can not run duel monitors and the support site is difficult to navigate if you are a novice as I am . 	Graphics Card
Everyone once in a while one of those video cards come out that can overclock like mad and hit much above what it 's supposed to . . At stock 7850 is actually pretty weak for a $ 250 card considering its next-gen . It 's better than the somewhat cheaper geforce 560Ti but not by much . And it 's slightly slower than 570 . To make things worse it 's not really much better than the previous gen Radeon 6950 . But the thing is amd has deliberately underclocked the 7850 . That is because clock for clock the 7850 is only about 5 % slower than the 7870 . And the 7870 is a $ 300 + card . Surely , they could n't allow the 7850 to have the higher 7870 clocks . Here 's the deal if you overclock this card it would pretty much lay to waste most video cards this side of the gtx580 . And here 's why : 1 . 7850 scales VERY linearly with clock . That means if you overclock by 20 % your real-world performance in games jumps by 20 % . 2 . 1050mhz -LRB- 22 % overclock -RRB- is pretty much guaranteed . There 's not a single 7850 on the internet that could n't do 1050 mhz . 3 . I got one of the bad samples and ended up with a `` bad '' overclock of 1100 mhz 24\/7 stable . Along with memory over clocks , i get 25-30 % increase in frame rates compared to stock . 4 . At those speeds the 7850 sails past the 570 and gives the 580 a run for its money . Its just unfair to compare it to the 560 Ti now . A lot -LRB- but NOT all -RRB- of cards hit 1200 mhz . Beyond that the scaling is less linear . From 1200 mhz you 'll only get a few fps for a huge increase in temps\/power . Simply put overclocked this really is the best video card at $ 250 . If you do n't you 're throwing your money away . And there 's no reason why you should n't . If you 're not overclocking you 're missing out on 30 % FREE performance . Please my friend , read up on overclocking and make the best of your money !

Fastest single chip video card . Runs cool and very quiet even at full load , gave me 40-45 % extra performance than my 6970 HIS icecool , no crashes after hours of gaming ! Best ever , pricey but you pay for performance I am very happy with my purchase . I had before sapphire 6990 and while performance was better it was little too much heat and noise from that card so I sold it and got one 6970 from his and it was very good but I missed my 6990 performance ... not anymore !!!!! Get it you will not regreat your decision . 	Graphics Card
im not gonna give a huge long technical analysis of this card , but it works great ! i had n't heard of visiontek before and was a little leery of trying a new brand , but it was the least expensive 7970 available . Fortunately my money was n't wasted , it works spectacularly . i am running a 3 monitor setup with this one card flawlessly . only loss fps rate when running games on all screens , but even that did n't effect the performance by much . i can play Battlefield 3 on single monitor at 90 + fps easily , and 3 screens at 60 + . so all in all a great buy , i would recommend for anyone who wants the true gaming experience 	Graphics Card
This works well with my ATI AGP8X for multiple monitors in windows 7 . The drivers work flawlessly alongside the ATI Catalyst control Center and added a whole new life to my 3.2 GHz HT Intel motherboard . It also works with XP on another partition . 	Graphics Card
Bought this to salvage an HP Pavilion notebook PC with onboard video that failed . Easy installation and works as a primary display -LRB- 1280x1024 -RRB- with an external monitor . Compatible with Windows Vista but disables Aero display features . No issues with general internet surfing and multitasking . Great value vs replacing a motherboard ! 	Graphics Card
I remember back when nVidia was giving ATI a run for their money . ATI has long since stepped up it 's game to the point that even this `` lower end '' video card is top of the line . There is nothing low end about this card . It even has ports on it for liquid cooling , and I 'm sure , would need it if I was using both digital ports for two large screens . As it is , I 'm only using it on my wife 's office machine -LRB- and a bit of Star Trek Online when she is n't in the office -RRB- . It does an awesome job at a very low cost . 	Graphics Card
So I purchased this card since it had the most muscle for the older style AGP . Mind you , I am quite computer friendly , and build them myself . This card was a pain since the drivers took 4 downloads to work . The card then lasted about 2 months before crapping out . I took my old Nvidia card . Put it back in the computer , and 5 mins later had it back up and running . Its been months now with no issue . I have heard similar stories about ATI 's cards in recent years . In fact , my last ATI card was always finicky . I would not recommend ATI graphics cards if you are looking for stability . 	Graphics Card
I bought this on the 14th and received it on the 15th . The card is very good , and has a dual bios switch . Shaders were unlocked easily by just flipping the bios switch . The temperatures is around 37-38 at idle and max was around 61 degrees while playing crysis and the witcher 2 on max settings . This card averages around 40 fps on very high settings when using Crysis Benchmark . Overall , this is an excellent card and I am very satisfied . 	Graphics Card
i do n't like it because it do n't work on windows xp otherwise its ok software hard to install return it 	Graphics Card
First off I am using this with : i7 2600k @ 3.8 16 Gigs of RAM at 1600MHZ 850 Watt PSU My performance in games using EVGA Precision X monitoring . Keep in mind these numbers are WITHOUT OC . With modest OC expect a 5-10 FPS increase . Witcher 2 : All settings maxed , Ubersampling off - Average of 60 FPS . Gorgeous . All settings maxed , ubersampling on 30-50 FPS . Still very playable . Recommend OC to increase the frames provided you want ubersampling on -LRB- not a noticeable difference honestly to me -RRB- Metro 2033 : Average of 40-60 FPS . Probably the card 's weakest performance . Frames sit at about 50 , in some areas it can dip below 40 . Keep in mind this is everything maxed -LRB- aside from AAA , and 16x -RRB- . Battlefield 3 : Everything maxed , vertical sync disabled . Multiplayer is at about average of 70 FPS . Some areas of campaign can vary between 45-70 . Very solid performance . This game heats up my 680 to about 79C , no other game takes it that hot . Crysis 2 : All settings maxed , vertical sync disabled 45-70 FPS depending on how many explosions and wide the environments are . Some of the battle locations in Crysis 2 are large and require lots of memory . Can notice a slight decline in smooth gameplay . Very demanding game , gives good performance . To play this game I recommend to OC . Diablo 3 : This is a driver issue im about 80 % sure , all settings maxed ofc -LRB- not a demanding game at all -RRB- yet when I first start playing the game horrible stuttering and lag for about a couple minutes . Seems as if it needs time to catch up to the normal 60 FPS I get after the initial intense lag . Weird . Conclusion : Stock performance is respectable . OC recommended . Mine just so happens to OC alright . Make sure to disable vertical sync as this was hindering my 680 's performance greatly until I figured out i needed to disable it -LRB- duh -RRB- . Do n't feel the need to overclock my CPU to 4.7 like I did before . 3.8 is fine . Hope this helps . Feel free to ask questions . 	Graphics Card
Our original card fried . No success looking at local Electronic stores , since AGP is old school ... little stock remained . I should have gone on Amazon first , but wanted one the same day . As it turned out , I found this card , which works wonderfully , priced splendidly and was delivered in 3 days . Very happy . 	Graphics Card
I 've got a three monitor setup -LRB- 2 x 23 '' led and 1 x 47 '' lcd -RRB- . The 47 '' is powered by this adapter . Installation to use took about five minutes , with VERY simple instructions . It does exactly what it says . Highly recommended . 	Graphics Card
When I first bought this graphics card , I originally bought it from Amazon but they sent me a bad product so I had to re-order from NewEGG . Thanks for that BTW , Amazon . Since getting this card to replace my aging GTX 560 Ti -LRB- FTW -RRB- , I have been most pleased with its performance . The 560 Ti could NOT run most games at 720p on high settings . At would lag and frame rate would drop dramatically . The GTX 670 FTW Edition smokes the 5 series cards . With over 1,300 cores and 2 GBs of memory , you wo n't need another video card for years . Hell , by the time this card is outdated , you could just get a second one and you have enough power to last for 2 more years and only spend half what you did prior . I highly recommend spending big on your first REAL video card . I got this one for 400 USD but I also got a good deal from NewEGG because I received coupons for FREE copies of Assassins Creed 3 and Borderlands 2 . Performance is off the carts . The temperature is steady and when you use EVGA Precision X to control the fan speed automatically , you never have to worry about the temperature rising above 120 degrees Fahrenheit . PLus , it 's quiet . It will not disturb you while playing the more non-intensive games like Turn Based Strategy . There is only one downside to this card and I do not count it against it at all really . The card is large in size so you MUST have a larger style , or FULL size tower case to fit this thing . Also keep in mind that it REQUIRES two 6-pin connectors from one of your power supply rails . Make sure you have a minimum of 750 watts of power available to you . The newer power supplies should have no problem supporting two of these babies . I 'll see you all on the digital battlefield ! 	Graphics Card
This is a superb product from Galaxy . Although it is my first experience buying a Galaxy product but I am very satisfied with my purchase . The quality is top notch and the product is the best out there . If you are building your dream machine , just get this GTX680 . 	Graphics Card
Recently purchased the Sapphire 3850 to replace my burned up video card for my 2004 custom built tower . This card breathed new life in my old 1G computer and have saved me a bundle for the immediate future -LRB- not having to replace my old system -RRB- . Simple installation and no hunting on the internet for current driver updates were needed . This card is considerably longer in length than my previous video card and it was a tight fit in my coolermaster case . In my search , good APG replacement cards are becoming hard to find as all the rage is the PC Express pin style ; however . The Sapphire Radeon 3850 seems to be an excellent alternative and at less than $ 130 it was a great investment . I am very pleased and would highly reccommend this product . 	Graphics Card
Extremely quiet even when the fan speed is high -LRB- compared to the 4870X2 it replaced it is silent -RRB- . Easy installation and it handles all the games I own without breaking a sweat . I will give it a true test when Skyrim comes down in price , but Diablo III does n't even cause it to elevate settings and Arkham City at maximum with full DX11 effects only stuttered once in 3 hours . My first Nvidia card and I am impressed . The OC software is simple to use and monitoring temps and fan speed is easy to do . A little spendy , but warranty protection for an OC 'd card and the superior cooling are worth it . When the price drops I may likely add a second card in SLI mode . 	Graphics Card
I wanted to add a 2nd computer and this works great . Just plug and play . It sure beats getting a new video card . 	Graphics Card
Excellent GTX 680 Reference Card with 3 Free Games & 5 Year Warranty This is Zotac 's entry into the new nVidia Kepler GTX 680 line and it meets reference specifications . What 's different from other reference cards is that this Zotac card comes bundled with Assassin 's Creed I , II , and Revelations and also has a 5-year warranty unlike the others which only offer 3 year warranties and no video game bundle . This card runs cool and can get 30-40 fps on Battlefield 3 Ultra settings at 2560x1600 -- impressive ! 	Graphics Card
Worked well right out of the box . Easy installation . No complaints . I may buy another one to have three monitors . 	Graphics Card
Runs Every game at maxed out settings 1080P no problem . I will say this though while playing games it 's not noticeably faster than a custom 7970 like the Sapphire dual x oc . I had problems with my 7970 and switched . I expected a bigger performance increase due to all the hype do n't believe it they are both amazing videocards . IF you can grab an aftermarket 7970 for around 450 $ I would n't wait for this . Unless you run fraps The whole time playing all your games you will not notice the difference . Bf3 , WItcher 2 , Metro 2033 , diablo 3 , crysis 2 , are the games I tried with it . system : i5 2500k XFX XXX edition 850w PSU Asrock Extreme 3 Gen 3 mobo 8gb 1600 corsair vengence ddr3 ram 	Graphics Card
Just got and installed it into my HP Pavilion Elite HPE-480t . Card fit fine and was easy to install , did have to upgrade my PSU though . I purchased the Corsair 600w , which also fit fine and I would recommend . With the card you can get a free game called Dirt 3 through steam . The offer said it expires on 12\/31\/11 but it still worked when I tried it today -LRB- 01\/12\/12 -RRB- . First thing I did was log into Starcraft 2 and I 'm getting between 80-100 fps playing on ultra settings . : -RRB- It has no fan noise so far and is a beast . Just filled out the rebate form for $ 20 so make sure you purchase it soon . I think the rebate ends on 01\/14\/12 . I 'm now off to get BattleField 3 which this card will also run on the highest settings !!! 	Graphics Card
You will not receive the game `` Deus Ex '' packaged with this video card for at least 10 days . It has been advised to me by amazon customer service representatives that if you want the free game before Amazon 's senseless 10 day wait policy , you should shop elsewhere . Other stores carry the same promo but send you the game immediately . I recommend following the CSR 's advice . The card itself is great though , even if Amazon is not . It 's very fast and runs everything I throw at it with full speed . It comes with a free copy of Dirt 3 -- in the box , so you get it at the same time as the video card . 	Graphics Card
I purchased this card to use in a Pentium4 D computer with an AGP 8x slot , with the intention of getting accelerated openGL and compositing effects at 1680x1050 , in KDE 4 . It worked . The installation was straight forward and it has worked as it should for 3 weeks now . I have not tried the Windows drivers as I do not use Windows on this computer . This is a good basic AGP video card . If that is what you need do not hesitate to buy it . 	Graphics Card
I love this card . It has the best performance specs that I could find for a card under two hundred . It takes everything I throw at it . Skyrim , Battlefied3 , The Old Republic , all at highest settings and still getting good fps . I would have given this card a 5 Star rating , but no crossfire ? Also this card is massive , I had to push some of my hard drives forward and finagle cables in order to get it to fit . The fan is quiet until it reaches 75 % -LRB- using MSI Afterburner -RRB- or higher fan speed . 	Graphics Card
This is a VERY good card . Fast with enough memory to handle the extra stuff . Handles MW3 and BF3 on High and ultra with no problems . The card runs cool with adequate ventalation . This is a good buy for gamers that want the speed without spending a mint . 	Graphics Card
As noted above , this card works , is easy to install , and comes low profile ready for slimline computer cases . In my particular case , an early 2006 HP slimline s7320n , the heatsink on the card is slightly too big leaving me with 2 options : 1 -RRB- lay the pc on its side -LRB- which I already do anyway -RRB- and do not screw the bottom case piece back in . 2 -RRB- find a different low profile card that fits better I chose -LRB- 1 -RRB- . The bottom piece of casing is not screwed in and just barely is pushed out -LRB- the screw holes are not lined up by about 1\/3 inch -RRB- . This may be undesirable to someone with a more traditional setup , and obviously I would rather be able to put the case all the way on . That said , there are simply not many video card options for us slimliners and this one is conveniently powered completely by the pci bus . Finally , if you need this for a slimline , you will need a DVI cable . It comes with 2 low profile brackets : 1 that utilizes the S-Video and DVI outputs and 1 that utilizes the VGA output . The one utilizing the VGA is useless , at least in my case , because the card can not fit without completely disconnecting the VGA . 	Graphics Card
This card its magnificent , it can run every posible game at this moment without problems . Asus did a great job with the package of the card , really good looking . Apart from that this its just like any other 680 reference card in the market , with 3 year warranty . The one i have its from a good batch , it overclocks really well -LRB- Core : 1300 \/ Memory : 6800 -RRB- 	Graphics Card
I edit videos on Sony Vegas all the time , so I wanted to speed up my program . This Graphics Card did the job ! It makes Sony Vegas run smoother . Also , with this card I can now max out my HD PVR 's settings . Very cool ! The only problem I had with this is it only had 2 DVI slots and a mini HDMI connector on it . I used VGA previously , so I had to get a VGA to DVI connector . That 's about another $ 10 on Amazon . Still , I suggest this video card if you want to speed up your videos : -RRB- Update : After using this card for a while and going into more intensive programs , I did see this card have issues . It 'll stutter a bit with Sony Vegas with a bunch of layers and some other pretty hardcore programs . As for gaming , this card runs very well with gaming . You can play games like Battlefield 3 without much of a problem . You definitely wo n't be able to jack the settings up all the way , but it 'll run them without really terrible lag . If you have a pretty stock computer and you 're looking for a quick boost in Graphics , buy this card . The requirements are n't very high and it is certainly an upgrade from integrated Graphics .

I needed a PCI graphics card with a DVI output so I could add a second monitor . Received the card in a timely fasion , intalled it in the PC , and I was up and running in 15 minutes . I am very happy . 	Graphics Card
This video card came with my HP Pavillion Elite . This is now the end of the third video card in about 5 years . Under warranty HP replaced the previous 2 cards with the same model . Cooling fan wears out in 1.5 to 2 years and gets noisy . Yes , it WAS very quiet when new . Now it whines constantly . Now since it is not under warranty , I will go with something else . I 'm trying an EVGA GeoForce 8200 with double the memory and costs less and has the same ports as the HD4350 . This HD4350 was a decent video card , but not that durable . Now I can finally get video card that can handle the kid 's Skyrim game at a decent framerate . 	Graphics Card
i had the XFX 5870 and it was a beast . this is the first card that i have gotten that could compete with it . the gtx 580 was a joke and slower than my old card . the HD 5970 was the same performance level . i started thinking that maybe my processor was bottlenecking the performace . the new 7970 actually gets better framerates . not by a mile but good enough . i 'm looking at a 25 % performance gain with the stock drivers , and a pci express 2.0 . in a few months i 'll upgrade the processor and motherboard , and the updated drivers will be out and it should get even better framerates . but that remains to be seen . will update when the magic happens .

"First off , I am familiar with computer hardware but am in no means a tech . I ordered this graphics card with a <ahref=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004MYFODS/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/182-7566560-2897959""> Corsair Enthusiast Series 850-Watt 80 Plus Bronze Certified Power Supply Compatible with Intel Core i3 , i5 , i7 and AMD platforms - CMPSU-850TXV2 </a> and I must say I was very impressed . While there was not many instructions with the card on how to install I watched enough `` How-To '' videos to feel semi comfortable opening the computer case and replacing the card . As I progressed I found out that installation of a PCI express card is a breeze and I had no need to be apprehensive in the first place . Make sure to plug in everything including 2 power cables ! Turned on the computer and installed the drivers with the provided CD and walla ! I am able to play all the games I want on the highest graphics settings -LRB- Shogun 2 and SWTOR -RRB- . I highly recommend this product ! Update : Make sure to pay attention to the `` Product Dimensions : 12.5 x 3.5 x 6.5 inches . '' The card is very large ! installed in my bosses computer and had to move a hard drive . However , all went well . "	Graphics Card

i saw the benchmark at youtube website and gtx 580 is much powerful than gtx 570 but between gtx 680 and gtx 670 was almost same performance but 100 dollar less so i decide to buy gtx 670 . im very happy with this compare to gtx 580 -LRB- my previous card -RRB- . if you overclock the gtx 670 will overpower gtx 680 and thats awesome ! by the way 3d vision is just amazing and im telling you guys 3d movies sucks but 3d gaming is AMAZING because 3d effect is lot more 3 dimension than 3d movies !!!!! too bad lot of people do n't even give it a try . 2d flat picture gaming sucks !!!!!! UPDATE ! !!!!!!!!!! DO NOT BUY THIS MODEL -LRB- 02G-P4-2670 -RRB- IT ONLY LASTED ME 2 WEEKS !!! BUY THE GTX 670 -LRB- 02G-P4-2678 -RRB- MODEL INSTEAD !!! IT SEEMS LIKE EVGA FIXED ALL THE BAD PROBLEMS ON THIS NEW MODEL . I READ THE REVIEW FROM NEWEGG WEBSITE AND HARDLY NOBODY COMPLAIN ON THIS MODEL I SHOULD HAVE LISTEN TO THOSE REVIEWS . IM VERY HAPPY WITH THE NEW MODEL 	Graphics Card
Ordered this card after having 2 failed Nvidia cards back to back and I do n't know why I ever tried anything other than AMD . The card fired up immediately , all functions working correctly and games running as smooth as silk . The only complaint I have about the card is that it was just a bit too expensive to buy 2 for crossfire at the time I originally purchased it . 	Graphics Card
This card really is a monster . It gives me much better performance then my old 4870X2 did for less heat and less watts pulled . The Dual-X cooling design helps keep the card a mild 30C idle and a maximum 54C under load in Saints Row 2\/3 . If you are going to be overclocking this beware for the time being , AMD 's drivers are not optimized yet and you run the risk of blue screening or just having the game freeze period . I OC ` ed it to 1Ghz gpu clock and it froze 8 minutes into mu SR3 test . This combined with a I7-3930K is more then strong enough to play even the most demanding games , emulated games like Tales of Symphonia w \/ LLE or Zone of the Enders , without much hassle .

I own an old DELL Dimension 2300 with a Celeron processor . Years ago I upgraded the audio with a 24-bit sound card , and recently upgraded the memory to the full 1 gig of RAM that it 'll take . I 've been working off of the on-board video all this time , however , which did not drive a new LCD HD monitor I was given to it 's full 1440 X 900 resolution . I also got addicted to an online game which was nearly impossible to play so I needed to bring the video a little closer to today 's standards . The Nvidia GeForce 6200 did ALL of this for me , so if you 're in a similar situation , and like me ca n't afford to go make Bill Gates richer right now then GET THIS CARD . Not only did it make online game playing better AND drive my LCD monitor at the proper resolution , when I watch DVDs on my computer now it seems as if you can reach into the monitor ! The picture is THAT real . And installation is EASY . If you know how to install a card in your computer then you 're all set . I even dragged the old CRT monitor out & connected it to the on-board video thinking I would have to select the new card to `` turn it on '' , but when I powered-up the computer BOTH monitors came on ! The software is very user-friendly and contains simple , easy to understand instructions that allow you to adjust nearly every parameter of the card . If I need another card like this I 'll look at EVGA Corporation again FIRST . Excellent product . 	Graphics Card
I bought this card as an upgrade to my Sapphire HD5750 . This card is well built , not flashy and very powerful ! It installed fairly easily , although I had to move my hard drives to a different slot in my case as this card spans the entire inside of my Antec 900 case . The performance is amazing . Battlefield 3 runs at 80 + fps on Ultra @ 1280x1024 . On high\/ultra hybrid I was getting 120 + fps . Last night I noticed some choppiness while playing . I exited my game to try and free up some resources and started getting artifacts -LRB- video errors -RRB- on my screen . My display froze , went blank and then returned saying the driver crashed and was recovered . It looped this way forever . I have done everything software wise to fix this , and I believe it is a corrupt memory issue on the card , but I can not confirm this . I have done no modifications , over clocking etc. to any of my hardware . The GPU sat at a comfortable 45-48C and never had fan issues . See the video below for the artifacting . I checked an `` Egg Themed '' online retailer and found that there were 7 of 127 reviews that were negative . Almost all of them seem to have the same freezing artifacting issue , so it does n't appear to be a fluke . All this being said , I am STILL going to get this card . I will send this back -LRB- Amazon service has been great !!! -RRB- and get another and cross my fingers . Again , this card is AWSOME , when it works .

This video card is faster than most , DirectX 11 ready and requires no auxiliary power . It runs strictly off the PCI-E video slot . Under heavy load , it does n't exceed room temperature and the fan is whisper quiet . Plus , it 's dirt cheap . No brainer . Buy it . 	Graphics Card
I got this card through Amazon to replace my ATI X1550 Pro that was in my desktop previously to get the full gaming experience from my desktop and noticed a difference right away . My PC 's processor was not nearly working as hard , When I went into the system 's option on DOOM III the Auto adjust went from High Quality to Ultra High Quality without batting an eye , and the graphics seemed more life like like than it did before with alot more detail . I 've decided rename my card to ATI 's BAVC3850HD -LRB- Big -- Video Card 3850 HD -RRB- with emphasis on the `` A '' due to the size witch was at least 5 inches bigger than my ATI X1550 , my case was able to seat with no problems but would not try putting this baby in anything less than a full size ATX tower due to it 's size . Needs two 4 IDE Pin power plugs that will fit into a adapter that then plugs into the card itself to power it . ATI says the minimum is a 450W PSU but I would use at least a 500W PSU -LRB- Mine is a RAIDMAX 630W -RRB- . I did not bother with the driver CD that came with it but instead downloaded them from -LRB- ... -RRB- along with the 8.12 patch for VISTA and before swapping cards I had removed all the previous drivers , Loading the drivers in Windows XP the process took about 2 mins in Windows VISTA it took about 20 mins -LRB- this included the 8.12 patch -RRB- when done it did look great , just took alot longer to load in VISTA . Overall , An excellent card and well worth the upgrade but as most reviewers have mentioned this will most likely be AGP 's last Solid upgrade before riding off into the sunset , As of this writing ATI is the last Video Card company to make AGP cards but I doubt they will for much longer since all MOBO manufactures have turned over to PCIe , They will probably all but be gone by 2011 . This last upgrade will at least give me another year or two before I have to replace my aging based INTEL 865 PERLK Desktop -LRB- I had originally built in September of 2003 -RRB- .

Oops , Amazon pulled a fast one on me inadvertently or otherwise ! I decided to pass on going through any return drama and installed the card hoping the increased memory would be helpful . Previously had installed ATI 128Mb\/128 bit card on a 8 year old XP box and it worked flawlessly . Just the lack of memory inhibited streaming via Netflix , so thought upgrading to a card with 512 Mb memory would help and it did . KINDA ! This card is 64bit which seems stupid with the 512 Mb memory , go figure . When streaming video say from NetFlix , HULU the sound has a lot of static , yes static and is un-listenable . Not good ! I believe the APG -LRB- advanced computer graphic -RRB- was the best for it 's time but man , this PCI -LRB- not PCI Express -RRB- card sucks . Ca n't recommend this card , it is buggy !

I purchesed 2 of these boards , set them up on an ASRock 990pro without the need for jumpers and my Windows 7 experience for display jumped from 4.9 to 6.8 . Xfire rocks regardless of your application and these boards provide econimical access to most of the features with a reasonable price tag . So how good does it need to be ? You can spend $ 2K + for triple boards , but I do n't think you will see a significant improvement . 	Graphics Card
Great card for the money !! Went in easy and very quiet . As to the dirt3 retrieval and activation process , it is about the same degree of difficulty as finding an honest politician . Endless crapware to download and then login\/logout\/product ID 's \/ unique ID 's \/ coupon codes\/re-register\/go here\/go there - yadayada then have the process deadend in nowhereville . Designed to frustrate as many as possible . I assume most will not make it accross the moat . update 12\/26\/11 - after several hours of dloading on boradband I finally got to install the game on 12\/19\/2011 . When I went to play it on 12\/26\/2011 - it wanted to `` update '' for another 3 hours . rediculous . Why not give out the right download the first time around ? Like I said , big waste of time - free game ... right . card is still great - justy forget about the game stuff . 	Graphics Card

Seagate has a major quality problem . I ordered two of these from Amazon , one worked right out of the box , the other did n't . -LRB- First DOA - dead on arrival . -RRB- Replaced the failing drive with another from Amazon . DOA . While talking w. Seagate , they asked that I replace it with one directly from them -LRB- Seagate -RRB- . Another DOA . So that 's 3 DOA out of four . In each case , the drive failed while running Seagate 's own diagnostic read\/write tests . One wonders if they test anything before shipment , and if so , how ? And now Seagate says they are out of stock . Backordered . Presumably due to the floods is Thailand . Guess I 'm S.O.L. 	HardDrive
I have owned many Iomega Hard Drives but I find the Western Digital Passport , small , compact and somewhat rugged . For the size and storage capacity -LRB- 1 TB -RRB- I could n't ask for a better portable drive . I have no compaints about this product and would purchase many times over . 	HardDrive
It 's a bare hard drive that arrived quickly from Amazon and well-packaged . I replaced a 500GB WD Caviar Blue WD5000AAKS with this WD Caviar Blue WD10EALX as the primary drive in an HP i7 desktop . This drive and the old WD drive show basically identical CrystalMark results , but it does seem to load programs and boot faster -LRB- I restored an image of the old installation to the new disk , so everything else is the same -RRB- . CrystalMark shows that it outperforms the Green series drives I own by 20-30 % . I was looking at the WD Caviar Black drives , and saw some reviews that said they are loud , so I went for this one , which is advertised as quieter and cooler than the Black series and insignificantly slower than a Black . I do n't have a Black series to compare to , but the WD10EALX is definitely louder than the 500GB Blue version , and also louder than 1TB and 2TB WD Green drives that I own . It 's not LOUD , but it is louder than those other drives . It has the normal disk seek sound which is not annoying , but present in the same way the computer fan noise is present . If you are going for the ultimate in quiet , then this is n't it . If you want to compare this to Seagate , then it is a 300 star product . I used to be a Seagate customer as their price\/performance ratio seemed great . I got hosed by Seagate with a 1.5 TB drive , the same one that everyone else got hosed on . They offered to recover my data for $ 900 . I told them to stuff it and I only buy WD and other brands now . My plan is to use this drive a year or so and replace with SSD , demoting this one to backup . I 'd probably try another brand at this price point if I had to buy another 7200RPM 1TB drive , but I am not disappointed in my purchase , just underwhelmed by the performance . It is advertised as being quiet and fast , but it is not quieter nor faster than the disk it replaces , hence the relatively low rating and minor disappointment . 	HardDrive
Good system , as advertized , fast shipping . Every thing you needed came with this system , key board , mouse , power cord , video adapter , and OS disks . All that was needed was a monitor and electrical power . Very easy to set up . Runs great . 	HardDrive
I needed a Harddrive to use as a COMPLETE storage for my digital files -LRB- mp3 , video , jpg , etc. . . -RRB- , and I wanted one that I would n't be too concerned about a few months now in terms of size , so I got this 1 TB external . A little background , I am making a transition to MAC use as well as PC , and I 've got Windows on my Mac . I wanted a backup for both , and upon my first internet searching -LRB- after I had recieved the external -RRB- I was nervous b\/c of the 1 tb size . But with my MAC I was able to partition the disk 3 ways -LRB- they offer more partitions -RRB- , 1 for Time Machine , 1 for Mac Files and 1 for Win Files . The Win Files partition was allowed on FAT32 , and it 's worked flawlessy so far on both MAC and WIN Operating Systems . It loads properly -LRB- although WIN does n't recognize the MAC formatted partitions - naturally -RRB- , no problems transfering on either platform , and ejects fine . Rather quiet and nothing really to it . A suitable back-up for everthing , and I can just keep it at my home desk for use whenever . 	HardDrive
I 've had this recorder for years now and it 's still my favorite out of all the different makes and models I 've tried because it has the best quality recordings from those old VHS tapes , and Laserdiscs . Even though it does n't have some of the features the newer recorders have these days this model gets the job done great ! It does have a 40gb HDD you can choose to record on , but DVD-RAM is usually better - because you can just put that unfinalized DVD-RAM disc into your PC and edit the video with your favorite software . The DVD-RAM discs are just like a hard drive - they can be erased , and used over and over again ! This is an older model -LRB- released in 2003 -RRB- , so it 's receiver has only an analog broadcast tuner and will require a converter box if you want to record directly from an antenna . 	HardDrive
For me one of the best branding on portable hard drive . Nice design and color , small and practicall to carry and use . Good price for features and capacity for this product . 	HardDrive

Lots of space for cheap and has n't failed me yet . You have only have USB 2 so the transfer speeds are a little slow , but otherwise its a great hard drive . 	HardDrive
Its a GREAT harddrive on its own , but the price really ... I could have bought a 100GB hard drive for less , but amazon.com always gave me the packge , so i bought it here . Its quiet , not like it matters , now my computer lods almost 3 times as fast . And the size is nice and comfy . Should last about 6yrs if you dont try to save space , if ya do well ... . A long time ... The 7200rpm makes it NICE ! However , the biggest drawback was installing it . Getting it hooked up was easy . I just copied EVERYTHING on my old 10GB hard drive , to the new 40GB hard drive , and it took about an hour , well just do it in the morning , and when your home from work , it should be done ; -RRB- 	HardDrive
From other reviews we were ready to have to evaluate and choose whether to `` install '' this Western Digital My Passport Essential SE 1 TB USB 3.0 \/ 2.0 Ultra Portable External Hard Drive according to its own instructions or by reformatting the drive entirely using Mac utilities . Well , it never came to that . My wife plugged it into a USB port in her Mac Air and there it was , ready to use ; just click and drag into it . No set up instructions ; no drivers to deal with ; nothing to download . Could not possibly have been simpler . It even prompted her as to whether she wanted to back up her computer to the external drive using Mac 's TimeKeeper -- not its own software . We did n't use any of its software . I 'll update this after several months -LRB- and more -RRB- regarding its durability . 	HardDrive
I purchased one of these 3TB drives a few months ago and was pleasantly surprised at how nice the drive looks . It 's a very sleek little package with a nice matte exterior . Seagate , like just about every other manufacturer , has put annoying LED lights on the front , which were easily concealed with a piece of electrical tape . That was the beginning and the end of anything good I have to say about this drive , though . I purchased this drive to use for Time Machine backups . Only two days after installing the original drive , OSX -LRB- Lion -RRB- stopped being able to mount it . Alusoft 's wonderful DiskWarrior software informed me that it was unable to repair the drive due to hardware failure . I figured it was just a bit of bad luck , so I returned the drive in exchange for a new one . A few weeks after setting up and using the new drive , OSX started in with errors about the drive being unreadable and only continual rebuilds with DiskWarrior would solve the problem , but only for a few days . Yesterday , though , even that stopped working and the drive is now completely unusable . Maybe this drive is OK for use to occasionally fire up and manually move your files over to , but it does n't seem capable of handling the continuous demands for use as a Time Machine drive . Maybe you 'll have better luck than me , but I 'd strongly suggest looking elsewhere and paying the premium for something that actually works instead of saving a few bucks and going through the hassle of owning one of these unreliable drives .

Western Digital External Hard Drive was my desire . It looks cute and a little more tiny than that one I used to see . It 's light and easy to carry . Simple manual !!! So far so good ... 	HardDrive
This hard-disk packs a punch in a little package . You get 1TB worth of storate in a 2.5 '' form factor . I bought it as a backup drive but the only problem is that this drive is 12mm in height vs the ` standard ' 9.5 mm profile . Translating , if you plan on using it with an enclosure , be aware that you 'll have to look for one that is able to fit this drive since most do n't work . I did n't try installing it on a laptop but technically you should n't have problems mounting it on a laptop 's HD bay . The drive is quite fast -LRB- specially if you connect it using via eSATA -RRB- and quiet . I 'm very satisfied with this purchase even though the drive is indeed pricier than WD 's last top-notch model : Scorpio 640 GB . I totally recommend this disk . 	HardDrive
Ideal product and transaction . Works on PC after a quick download which is available online for free . Actual storage space is 3.6 Tb 	HardDrive
This is the second WD HD I own , the first one i bought was stolen , but this one is the best conceal carry hd you can found in market , stores 1 tb , i think is more than you expect from the size . I really recommend this item to all of you . 	HardDrive
I have been happier with this computer than I have been with any computer I 've owned . I seriously suggest buying it as a replacement for an aging desktop-the keyboard feels like a desktop -LRB- important to me -RRB- and there has been careful attention to the details that make computing so much easier-like automatically finding drivers for external devices , installing them without a fuss and just making things work . A nice touch is that the computer starts up when you open the cover and Windows is up and running in seconds . Beautiful and bright display . Sign up with the SquareTrade newsletter and get a 3-year warrantee when they have one of their 35 % off sales - $ 60 for three years of Laptop protection . My daughter has the same computer and she uses it for advanced grad course calculations , so it has the performance to do more than e-mail and Word . A great buy ! 	HardDrive
I like simple . This external drive is simple . I pulled it out of the box , scanned quickly through the instructions , hooked it up to my PC , registered it , and started a back-up of my system within 5 minutes . I used the included Memeo back-up software . Very simple . And I like that . After the back-up completed I went around to every PC in the house , we have 4 , and I copied all the picture files to the Seagate Freeagent GoFlex hard drive . We have thousands of pictures on our PCs . I worry about having a crash or a fire and losing all those pictures . This external hard drive will mainly be used for picture storage as a back-up . It is small enough to fit easily into my fireproof safe , so even in the event of a fire , we should still be able to save our pictures . I have an older external hard drive that holds about 200GB and I will now make copies of all the pictures onto that hard drive and drop it off at my mothers house for safe keeping . Off site storage is always a good idea , just in case . Now its time to take more pictures . Because even though we have thousands of pictures , this 500GB drive will hold 160,000 pictures . That means I can take about 150,000 more pictures ! 	HardDrive
This was my third external hard drive ; I thought the price for this device was too good to be true , but I had faith in the WD name . After more than an hour , I was still unable to get this hard drive to work . My previous two drives were a breeze to install , but this one was absurd . The online `` help '' was useless , and even the various tips and tricks from online reviews did not work . Even if I got the drive to work at this point , I 'm still returning it . I need a drive I can rely on ; if this one is so flakey right out of the box , what 's it going to be like in a year ? 	HardDrive
"</div> <spanclass=""tiny""> Length : : 0:32 Mins </span> I really like this hard drive . I needed a way to store my old records that was affordable . This was my answer . It 's small so I can really take it anywhere I want . It 's large enough to hold my records for years to come and does n't need a power cord . I 'm not a computer freak so I do n't know if this would live up to your needs but for me it 's perfect . "	HardDrive
Yes it 's on , for reals . It 's so quite it makes me question my own ears . I got the 3TB version , and maybe I will be able to fill it in about 100 years . j\/k . I have 5 externals running off of a powered hub on my laptop at all times and this one takes the cake as the largest and quietest one of them all . One HD to rule them all ? Maybe , if the cake is a lie . Seriously , buy this one and site back and relax . 	HardDrive
I 've used this drive for about a year as my primary back-up . I turned it off along with the rest of my computer for a two week period when I would be out of town . Returned to a completely dead drive . No power . Will not start up . A one year old drive , designed to be a backup drive , fails . This is my last Western Digital drive . 	HardDrive
I bought this drive around December , and have been using it since . I plugged it into my Win7 PC , and have not had to do anything else . It is more than half full now , and I have not had any issues . It goes to sleep after a little while of not being used , and takes it a couple of seconds to rev up , but I knew that before buying it . 	HardDrive

I have received the package undamaged . I expected it to take longer but it came pretty quick which I was surprised so yeah ...

I bought this 1TB Canvio to back up my hard drive . I like the fact that it is portable -LRB- requires no power other than the USB computer connection -RRB- , it is very compact , and it 's USB3 . The drive runs silently and there is a light on the top front that lights when in use . I have had absolutely no problem with the USB cable -LRB- loose connection -RRB- issue that other reviewrs have mentioned . My USB fits snuggly into the drive and the computer , so a non-issue . Installed the software but will probably un-install it . The software is OK if you want to use an automatic backup scheduling but for me I just do it manually . File transferes are reasonably fast even at USB2 speeds . Ca n't comment on USB3 , do n't have one yet . My only complaint is the length of the USB cable ; only about a foot long . Not a big deal but it could have been longer . If you need something longer Toshiba has made sure that you ca n't just pull one out of your cable box , the connection on the Canvio end is proprietary . Very Satisfied ! 	HardDrive
Perhaps it should have been obvious to me , but I thought the external power supply was only provided in case the USB port power was insufficient . Well , it is needed at all times . I am used to portable drives which do n't need additional power , so this is somewhat less convenient , especially if you plan to take this drive with you . It is very well made though , and has a heavy duty feel to it . Part of it of course stems from the fact that it actually is quite heavy . Amazon could do a better job packaging this , there was only one small airbag in the box for padding and I think i was just lucky it arrived undamaged . Not a problem , just something to be aware of . 	HardDrive
this will work great for us and as large as the storage is we will be able to use for all computers in the house 	HardDrive
Great little device . It is really small and holds a terrabyte of data . I am glad I bought this to back up my laptop . It get warm but not hot and is plug and play wou ; ld be even faster with a usb3 but plenty fast for me . Backed up laptop in about 20 min . Was going to return to Amazon as they put on sale even more after purchase , they sent me a return OK to mail back , it would have been easier to issue a credit for difference , but I decided not worth returning and buying again . Dissapointed with that part of transaction you have to watch them on everything -LRB- shipping costs and sales -RRB- thats sneaky on their part . 	HardDrive
I bought this drive as a way to free up space on my hard disk on 2010 . After very little use -LRB- maybe once o twice a month -RRB- , it has started making a beeping sound . I followed the troubleshooting steps on Seagate 's website and the diagnostics was the disk probably had physical damage . Even though the product is still covered by the warranty , the warranty does n't include data recovery from your disk . Data recovery quote was $ 599 to $ 1799 for non priority service . I 'm very disappointed as some files I did n't have any other copies except the ones on this disk , but do n't feel its worth the cost . On the other hand I have another drive from western digital from 2007 that still works fine . If you are evaluating options , I would probably recommend WD over Seagate . 	HardDrive
The case is nice enough , for a drive which might actually fit in it . But way too big for my Seagate FreeAgent Go 500 . The elastic strap does n't even stretch when the drive is in place , and the drive is free to slide around and bounce against the edges . Which probably is worse for the drive then just throwing it in the average bag . I do use it , but I cut a padded envelope in half and wrap the drive in it first , then the drive is truly protected . It 's a hassle though , and I 'd really like to find a case which actually protected the drive properly and still was easy to take in and out . Note that this case is not actually padded . It has a semi-rigid shell , which along with some actual padding around the drive would be great . But you 'll have to supply your own cushioning -LRB- assuming your drive is small enough , like the FreeAgent Go -RRB- . 	HardDrive
This is great to have as a back up for your computer . I backed up all my programs in a very short amount of time . I offers speed and security in case your computer crashes , it 's easy to restore . Great price also compared to other stores for the same product ! Highly recommended !! 	HardDrive
Got this for Mac as many other reviewers on here said this device works with a Mac . As usual , flawless amazon shipping etc. . When I plugged it in a window popped up and asked if I wanted to create a backup of my computer - but I got the hard drive for specific files from my computer not to back the whole thing up and clicked `` choose later '' . When I tried to grab those files and DROP them in the TOSHIBA EXT folder it would n't let me -LRB- putting up a '' ` do n't ' circle with a line through it '' symbol -RRB- . I did some searching online to figure out how to reformat for Mac and after following some instructions from the Toshiba message boards it allowed me to drop the files -LRB- yay , `` green plus '' symbol -RRB- . I 've pasted the instructions here for reference for future purchasers with the same problem : As supplied this hard drive is formatted for Windows PC so does not work on MAC OS . To get it to work on my MAC I had to re-format the disk . You can do this using Disk Utility -LRB- Utilities - -RRB- Disk Utility -RRB- and select the TOSHIBA EXT drive and then select Erase and select the format option MAC OS Extended and then hit the `` Erase ... '' button . This will erase all the data on the disk -LRB- so save the manual and warranty if you want these prior to formatting -RRB- and re-format in MAC OS and it will then work . answered 1 month , 1 week ago by beijingkenny - san francisco Source : http:\/\/answers.toshiba.com\/answers\/0293\/category\/504787\/canvio-3-0-questions-answers\/questions.htm 	HardDrive

I 've had this 250 GB Titanium model drive for about 2 years now and ca n't seem to find a complaint with it . It does what I was hoping to do , and I did n't go broke in the process . Admittedly , I hesitated to buy it based on some negative reviews , but as I was new to using external drives , and was on a limited budget , Fantom 's reviews were still better than some others in the same price range , and so I gave it a shot . I have used it with both an Apple iBook G3 , as well as an Apple Mac G4 Dual , both running Mac OS X 10.3 . x. It was easy for me to set up , and I 've used it literally , every single day since it came out of the box , for backing up just about everything on my machine and then some . After two years , I still have about 60GB of free space left . It 's compact in size which has been perfect for traveling with the laptop , and also for staying out of the way of other equipment when I use it with the desktop . Going back and forth between computers has never been a problem . It is relatively light for portability , but heavy enough to feel that it 's solidly made . It 's generally so quiet , that I have to crane my head around to make sure the blue light is still on . Only when I 've really gone to town with transferring big files to and from the drive , have I ever really heard a good amount of whirring . And even with large audio and recording software files , it usually has n't taken more than a minute or two of waiting time . Even when transferring large collections of audio or video data , I think the longest I 've ever waited was about 10 minutes . The Titanium name seems appropriate , too , as this drive 's strong metal case has held up under the ultimate tests of hardcore use and sometimes accidental abuse . This drive has been packed up and taken outside of my apartment on many different occasions , plugged into other people 's machines , accidentally unplugged without ejecting first , bumped into , dropped ... even a minor coffee spill . And yet , the drive continues to work flawlessly and fast , with nary a mark on its case . In most cases , all I had to do was plug the Firewire cable back into the machine and it recognized the drive again . I 've since been more careful about taking care of it and limiting other 's access to it , but I 'm now very confident that anything that might happen to the drive in the future , will most likely have been due to my own mistakes . But so far , no problems and I am much more careful now , as to not press my luck . Because the drive has two Firewire ports on it , it has also been handy in other ways . When a friend 's computer crashed and would n't read his own drive , and my computer would n't recognize his drive either ... as a last resort , I connected his drive to my Fantom ... and to my surprise , my computer could then retrieve the information from my friend 's drive . Because my own computers had only one Firewire port , the Fantom has also been handy as a Firewire hub of sorts , where I was able to connect my mini DV camera to the computer , while the drive itself was still backing up the fresh footage I was shooting through Quicktime Pro , or transferring to Final Cut . Anyway , I 'm not sure where all the negative comments about Fantom comes from ... -LRB- are people installing the drives properly ? subjecting the drives to more regular abuse ? -RRB- maybe there are some defective drives in the line , but as for me , I have been able to trust this one particular drive with precious Pro Tools and Final Cut sessions , screenplays , Web site work , correspondence , contracts , my iTunes music library , photos and more , for two years and going . Friends using names such as Maxtor and LaCie which I 'm told have great reputations , have frequently told me about problems that I have never experienced with my drive ... and I was warned heavily about buying anything other than those brands . But in hindsight , I felt I had no choice but to take a risk and well , that risk saved me about $ 100 or more and it turned out that I had a more pleasant experience than I might have had I bought just to stay within brand popularity . Because I will be doing more work this coming year that will need more memory , I will purchase another , bigger drive , but at this point , I will be very comfortable with buying another Micronet product , specifically of the Fantom line . And I feel that if I take better care of it than I did this one early on , I 'm likely to continue not having problems . 	HardDrive
Software was a bit cumbersome . I guess I was explecting something more intuitive . Drive works fine but not as well as the Maxtor drive I was used to but all and all it is fine . 	HardDrive
This may be listed as a `` desktop '' hard drive , but I bought this TB for my Macbook and setting it up was a breeze . just go into your disk utilities and follow these directions that some customer posted earlier : `` FORMATTING DRIVE FOR THE MAC 1 .

It 's understandable that this TCP\/IP hard drive is advertised as having 320 GB , and I knew that the actual capacity was less because 1 `` GB '' is really only 0.93 % of a real GB . However , this .07 % loss in space accounts for almost 22 GB , leaving this Hard Drive just short of 300 GB . Granted , this is an inherant `` problem '' -LRB- more like annoyance -RRB- in every hard drive , but I was at least expecting the Hard Drive to break the 300 GB mark . Aside from this , it is an awesome drive and HIGHLY recommended . 	HardDrive

"</div> <spanclass=""tiny""> Length : : 1:35 Mins </span> I got the enclosure today , and I was up and running within 5 minutes ! All you need to do is press down on the spring catch , then the top and bottom of the case can be easily pried away . Once you do that , put in your 2.5 '' hard drive -LRB- I am using a western digital 160GB hard drive from a dead netbook -RRB- , put in the 4 screws , put together the casing , and life is good !

I used this storage drive for about three months before it completely stopped working . No reason , no warning . The manufacturer was very helpful in replacing the product and made it relatively simple . My replacement worked for about a month , and the drive wouldnt even turn on . Out of two drives , they both stopped working . I would not trust this drive to store any of my information . Not recommended . 	HardDrive
I bought this drive to replace an older 160gb passport model . I use it as a basic hard drive , so I do n't use the software that it comes with -LRB- I did n't install it on my PC -RRB- , I prefer the simplicity of just plug and copy and paste , that way I can plug into any computer and use my hard drive . So no complaints here , great little drive so far . 	HardDrive
i got this for the purpose of holding my 2.5 hard drive enclosure . the top and bottom has a hard casing to it so it 's not bendable or anything . 	HardDrive
. . you may have to revise your opinion . <p> Great while it worked -LRB- 3 months -RRB- . Liked the simple file drag-n-drop , ability to store data files , and compact size . <p> After a while it would not start up even after recharging the batteries as usual . Swopped with the spare set of batteries and it worked again . After another few weeks , switching it on would cause the screen to light up briefly , then die . Never got it to work again . <p> Still looking for a replacement . Any recommendations for a similar but RELIABLE jukebox ? 	HardDrive
I wanted a laptop that is portable and have good graphic card . So I do n't regret that I purchased this laptop because it is very light and performs great on 3D games . 3DMark score was 768 which is about the same as Desktop intel 2.4 GHz with Geforce 4 Ti 4600 can perform . I could play Unreal Tournament 2004 Demo -LRB- yes , demo just came out !! -RRB- w\/o lag @ high resolution . Only reason I gave 4 stars is that its hard drive is noisy . It has noise that new hard drive should n't make . gir gir gir gir . . U know . . I wonder if my laptop is defective or all v505dx hard drive is noisy but it is real problem in the quiet library .

Ordered yesterday , arrived today , here is a couple thoughts : Pros : 1 . USB 3.0 , fast transfer rate 2 . on\/off switch , protect the hard drive from swapping in & out 3 . well made , feels like a good product 4 . Includes one USB 3.0 Cable and one USB 2.0 Cable Cons : The power adapter is big and it will block another power plug-in . Others thought : I will get another one of it if it has a dual-bay model . One bay works , but two bay is better . Satisfied ? YES !! VERY MUCH !! 	HardDrive
I love this little thing ... only thing I can complain about is that it does not have security for the folders that you upload to it , other than that ... it is 100 % amazing . 	HardDrive
I purchased this external hard drive because Toshiba has a reputation for quality but the USB cable that comes with it is worthless crap . It is a 3.0 USB cable and already I have to buy a new one because after just a couple weeks it the connection is so loose that my computer does not recognize the hard drive and it wo n't feed power to it .

I 've been using this hard drive to back up my Macintosh G5 for several months now and it has worked perfectly . No problems at all . Highly recommended ! 	HardDrive
Beware Beware Beware ... Nice new box , looked good . Plugged it in ... wrote files to it . Next morning computer could n't find it . Shop techs could n't get it up either . WD says it 's not their problem and wo n't even try to retrieve files . This drive was up for maybe 3 hrs . Beware of WD ! 	HardDrive
FYI , I purchased a Samsung DVD writer -LRB- http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/gp\/product\/B002HFWBIA\/ref=oss_product -RRB- and this interface card and tried to install the Samsung using this device in my eMachines T3302 desktop running the latest version of Windows XP . My machine did not recognize that a device was there ; I tried everything I knew to no avail . Whether it was this interface card , the machine -LRB- four years old -RRB- or the DVD unit I have n't a clue . I had no way to test the Samsung as I do not have access to a SATA-native machine .

The Lacie 1 TB USB hard drive is a perfect storage machine . Quick and easy to run , fast download and upload speeds , and is nice to look at . I am very pleased with the purchase 	HardDrive
I purchased this to back up my new laptop which has plenty of RAM and storage with both a 2.0 and 3.0 USB port . It works fine if you back up small files , but each time I attempt to back up anything over 3 or 4 GB , the drive locks up and I get an error message . Needless to say , I 'm deeply disappointed . I 've been around computers a long time , but I thought I might be doing something wrong . I gave it to an IT who works at the Pentagon . He had the same problem . Save your money or go smaller . the 1T is a flop . 	HardDrive
I like how it looks , I liked OSX for the most part , but this computer is n't that great . The processor is n't that strong . My Athlon 2100 could process faster than this thing could and it was a fraction of the price . Here is my main concern though . I 've had this iMac for about 3 months now and its been pretty good up until now . The screen randomly flickers now and every once in a while it hangs for about 5 seconds -LRB- nothing works , ca n't move mouse , sounds stops playing -RRB- . The computer even freezes to the point where I have to shut it down and restart . I also turned it off thinking it overheated . Let it cool down for a few hours and started it up and it took about 8 restarts to actually let it boot up into OSX . I would n't recommend buying this product . I do n't know how other macs are but thisi one , my first one , is not good at all . I plan to try and make apple take it back or sell it for as much as I can get . I want my PC back . 	HardDrive
If you 're going to buy this , buy it NOW ! The price is low considering how much it was a week ago . . I hate how the price keeps fluctuating ! It 's a gamble to buy this product !

Great response by the shipper , great feedback on the order process - immediate delivery - Great Job ! 	HardDrive
It works just like you would expect and as of today it 's the only 1tb external hard drive that works without an extra power connection . Make sure you uninstall all the junk pre-installed software on it first - there is a special tool for that on their website . Overall , works great . Havent had any problems with it in the last 6 months of using it almost every day . 	HardDrive
I have used WD drives for over 15 years - ONLY one has ever failed on me before I needed to upgrade to a larger drive - a 3GB about 10 years ago , I think , and I was able to get ALL the data off it before it went dead . If given the choice I always go with a WD drive and the price on the 2TB Green made it the only choice for the # 4 HD in my Win7 64bit machine ! I am currently using three 1TB & one 2TB drives internal for - system , app , data , and graphics - also one 1TB and one 2TB drives in BlacX eSATA dock for external backup . ALL Green drives . I have had the four 1TB drives for over a year , the 2TB drives for about 6 months for one and about 1 month for the second . 	HardDrive
This portable hard drive works like a charm . Immediately after unwrapping I connect the included USB cord and connect it to my PC . It works without any problem . I moved thousands of family and vacation pictures and still have plenty of available space . This is my third WD portable hard drive , I have 2 500 Gb for about 2 years now and are working fine .

I love my ioSafe . Works great with time machine . MUCH BETTER than my OLD Western Digital . Plus i dont have to worry about spilling my coffee on it !! 	HardDrive
I bought my Qosmio in November of 2004 for work . I telecommute , so I am at home , at a hotel or at the office working basically 7 days a week . The intent was to have a Media Center capable device on a high end portable computer . This is all that and more ! Every aspect of MS Media Center functions flawlessly , and there is no room for complaint . The one thing I would like to see changed is the hard drive configuration . For a device as high end as this , Toshiba should lose the 60\/40GB drives and come stock with dual 100GB drives in a RAID-0 array . That would be something to brag about . Overall , I have no compaints other than the price and the weight , but I knew those factors when I bought it , and the sheer performance outweighs those drawbacks . I have used this device daily for seven months now . No regrets or remorse . 	HardDrive
Reviews for this drive at Neweegg and other sites painted a picture of unreliability , but I am impressed so far . I suspect poor packaging is the cause of many failed drives . This drive from Amazon had an amazing lightning deal price , was well packaged in a sealed factory cardboard hard drive box and adequately padded in bubble wrap . Was easy to copy the old drives to the new with software from Seagate 's site . Drive is very quiet , fast and has lots of room . A little faster than my previous two WD800BB drives in RAID . Only weird thing is that the box is clearly marked inside with the Western Digital logo and motto , though sealed with a Seagate label . 	HardDrive
Great deal for the price . Includes case , screwdriver , 4 screws when only 2 are needed , usb cord , etc. . Fits easily in enclosure with foam at end of case for cushioning . If you switch out drives a lot you 'll probably need more screws . I , like some others who have given it one star , had problems getting my computer to recognize the new drive in the enclosure . I was getting ready to return the enclosure , but wanted to do some research first : Turns out that if you start with a brand-new hard drive your operating system wo n't recognize it ; you 'll hear the chime of it finding a new device , and it might even say that its installing a driver , but the new drive will not show up . You have to go to Disk Management and assign the drive a letter before it will show up and be useable as a hard drive . Yeah , you 'd think plug and play would mean that you 'd be prompted with `` New storage device detected , would you like to format it ? '' or something , but no. . Neither Windows 7 nor Vista would recognize the hard drive until I assigned the drive a letter ; after that it works fine and is recognized every time . 	HardDrive
It is the best external hard drive I have ever had . It 's fast and not heavy at all . I have already made a back up all my stuff -LRB- 800 GB -RRB- and now is in a safe place . 3TB is a perfect disc size so get one now . 	HardDrive
Western Digital has supplied me with three hard drives in my computer computer builds . This one , lasted about 4 days . When I turned on the computer i was welcomed to a bios screen telling me that there was an error with my drive ... nice right ? I believe it 's a mechanical failure because it hums for a bit then clicks and repeats . This drive wasted a whole day of moving media , reloading software , and preparing for use by my father -LRB- shortcuts , favorites and his work software -RRB- . I was dazzled by the price and hoped to get the system up and running for my father ASAP so he could make invoices for work . It arrived fast not sure to thank the seller or the post office . I 'm very leery to buy another WD drive because of this and i would n't recommend at least this specific drive . 	HardDrive
First up the shipping through Prime took 2 days . I love that . The product is fantastic . I love being able to use my old SATA drives again . This is great for storing copies of my movies or music and other files . I recommend this for anyone who has internal SATA disk that you want to use as portables . 	HardDrive
I bought this drive for a custome built computer . I have used a few maxtor HD 's before but I havent used one in any of my own computers . This hard drive worked for about 4 months . then my computer started crashing randomly . I thought it was because I had a virus -LRB- and incident with Kazaa -RRB- so I tried re-installing XP . During installation , setup said that some files wer n't installed but i could go on and run XP without some . After installation the computer still randomly restarted . a few days later when I booted up , I headrd a horrable grinding noise and my comp quit working all together . Yes it was the hard drive all along . dont take chances with maxtor . western digital has much more stable and dependable hard drives 	HardDrive
I got this 1TB drive for nice deal and this works amazing . The initial setup was easy and the backups does n't take much time . However I disabled the backup as my choice . easy plug in and pretty fast all the files get transferred . Also ordered leather case for it to avoid any scratches . Pros - light weight , compact , quick transfer Cons - None 	HardDrive
I ca n't speak to the reliability since I 've only owned it for approximately 2 weeks . I 've formatted it , saved approximately 500 GB of data , and then transferred data from it . Works perfectly . The USB wire securely attaches to the Toshiba , no need to worry about accidentally disconnecting the hard drive while in use . The form factor is small and pleasant . No software is installed on the hard drive that you need to worry about removing . So far I highly recommend it . 	HardDrive
I use the drive to back up important data . I write a few GB to the drive each time . I was surprise by how fast data transfered onto the hard drive through the USB2 .0 interface . It is quiet and I have no complain . 	HardDrive
I bought one of these a year ago in Germany ... I was very happy to have an IBM hard drive although they were made in Hungary ... It was working well until a month ago when bad sectors started to corrupting my data ... As I live in Argentina , IBM will not change the defective hard drive ... 	HardDrive
You have to be careful from buying this exact brand and model drive from Amazon warehouse . The things are like bricks to me now . I had three different shipments and one did not work altogether . Two others made clicking sounds of death . I know better not to buy these . There is a reason that amazon warehouse sells them for cheap !!! 	HardDrive
The drive is very compact and works well . If purchasing to fit in the drive bay of the Goflex Media Player , this one did not fit . There is a smaller dimensioned version that does fit , but was not available on Amazon when I purchased . The company told me that it would , but it did n't , get the one with smaller dimensions . It still works very well connected to the USB port on the player though . 	HardDrive
The IoSafe waterproof and fireproof hard drives are perfect for the home and small business that needs a disaster proof and reliable means to store critical data . At 2.0 TB it is plenty big for backing up multiple computers and decades of family pictures and videos . IoSafe came in mint condition , installed easily , and started up flawlessly . It works great with my back-up software . This is the third IoSafe I have personally purchased and I would n't consider any other backup hard drive for my home . Thanks IoSafe for a great product !

I recently bought this machine -LRB- in the last 3 months -RRB- . Now the latest and greatest version of Media Center is out -LRB- version 2005 -RRB- , and Sony is telling me I need to buy a whole other machine to get 2005 . HP offered the same upgrade to their customers the day MCE 2005 was released . I would suggest looking at the HP media PC instead of this machine . 	HardDrive
This is an excellent hard drive and the best part is the on\/off switch in the front , which later models eliminated . However , it does have a `` sleep '' functionality that works well . One flakey thing , though , is if you shut if off manually at the switch , when you shut down your computer , it `` wakes up '' the hard drive and you have to manually turn off the hard drive again . Small problem , nothing to worry about . Apparently the `` sleep '' trigger on the hard drive just senses any shutdown or wakeup of the desktop . Overall , a great item to have with lots of storage space and is very , very quiet when its running . 	HardDrive
This 1TB drive is reasonbly quick and is a great value , especially considering it 's small size . The included software is a bonus , even if you do n't use it , the drive is still worth every penny . 	HardDrive

Western Digital Support says : -LRB- in a reply to an Amazon UK customer -RRB- `` Hi , Our new My Passport products use a standard Micro USB connector . This connector was recently adopted by the cell phone industry and a standard for cell phones , so you will be seeing it much more regularly going forward . Additionally , it was designed to be more durable than the Mini USB connector , so is better suited fur use with product that may be frequently unplugged , such as a portable hard drive . But if you have found that your USB cable does n't fit as tightly as you would like , please contact our support department and we 'll be happy to send you a replacement . You can find the support contact information at -LRB- ... -RRB- We will be pleased to help you . '' Hello , BS alert ! The micro USB connector is rated at 10000 insertion cycles -LRB- higher than the mini -RRB- but that does n't make it `` more durable '' or more reliable as it 's obviously flimsier and it does fall out more easily , as observed on my mobile phone . The higher insertion rating is meaningless from a design pov as design life of the cable assembly is still limited to the 1500 maximum insertions of the USB-A connector at the other end . The answer is to tape the micro usb to the HDD case , keep it in a case and do n't take it traveling ! 	HardDrive
At first I was kind of doubting on purchasing this product because of a bad review I read . At last this notebook was just what I expected for my home business , great screen , great performance , excellent interaction with digital photo and video cameras . Nothing more to ask from a notebook . 	HardDrive
It 's really small and easy to transport ! It was smaller than I thought it was going to be , but that 's fine . Completely plug-and-play , just plug it in and you 're ready to use it . One caveat is its speed - it is a little slow on a Mac . Its casing also feels a little cheap - like it would break if you dropped it . For the price , it 's a great deal . 	HardDrive
The display sucks . It 's matte , which is nice I guess , but it 's difficult to find a nice color\/gamma\/contrast \/ brightness ratio worked out . Some computers just look great the second you turn them on . This one takes some tweaking , and even then , it does n't look very good . The keys are raised up quite a bit , so they 're kind of loud when you type , but the typing experience itself is actually pretty good . The keys are small , but it seems like Samsung just shrunk them to fit fingertips so that the keys could fit on the small chassis without having to compromise keyboard size . The fan is kind of loud . There 's a `` Silent Mode '' but all it does it disable some of the graphics -LRB- it 'll disable Aero in Windows 7 -RRB- and spins the fan down for a few minutes before kicking it back up again when the processor starts to get hot . Battery life is TERRIBLE . It only gets ~ 2h :40 m on a full charge . That 's just ridiculous . The touchpad is crap . It has some pseudo-palm detection thing which just disables the touchpad while typing , but the default setting leaves a noticeable lag between typing and being able to use the touchpad again . When I use HDMI , the sound is really low until I disable sound enhancements in the sound control panel ... every time I use HDMI . Seriously , every time , the sound might get really low if I plug in a USB drive while the computer is connected to my TV via HDMI , so I have to go back into the sound settings and then check , uncheck and apply the sound enhancement option . Hard drive is a slow 5400 RPM , noisy hard drive . It 's not noisy like something is wrong with it , you can just hear the data being read because it 's a cheap hard drive . It 's completely made out of plastic . The lid feels like it 's part of a toy computer , despite it 's wanna-be classy `` brushed aluminum '' look . And for the size , it 's heavy . You 'd think an 11.6 '' laptop with a measly 4-cell battery and all-plastic build would weigh less . Well , it does n't . I do n't know where Staples gets off selling this thing for $ 700 . $ 480 is a little bit overboard for this machine . Yeah , it 's marginally better than a $ 300 Eee PC , but you 're better off buying an HP dm1z direct from HP . Unless of course you need or want Intel . I like to use Linux , and the HP dm1 I had before this was frustrating in Linux . Using external displays was a pain , and the brightness keys did n't work . I do n't know if I can return this , because the receipt says something about `` unopened merchandise '' , but I might try and see what I can do . This computer kind of sucks ... even for $ 480 .

Was so excited to finally have USB 3.0 for Mac . But as you 'll see their are some issues . Now you can download a driver from Lacie so that you can attach these along with their PCI-E usb 3.0 cards or their usb 3.0 expresscard\/34 to your Mac ... It 's all a fairly good idea . Be warned ahead of time a few things !!! One , to be fair I did know this before I bought mine , is that their USB 3.0 devices are propietary in other words you have to use Lacie products and download their Mac driver from their website not compatible with non Lacie PCI-E cards or ExpressCards\/34 ... no big deal just buy Lacie , their most of the time good products and fairly competitive in price . However the bigger problem for me is issue number two , when I plugged in this new Lacie Rikki USB 3.0 hard drive to my mac via Lacie 's USB 3.0 ExpressCard\/34 it just beeped and no drive showed up . I then tried uninstalling and reinstalling their driver . Same thing it just beeped and no drive showed up , I did know the drive worked ok because it plugged into my desktop just fine but I was really bummed about it not working on my Laptop as this was the main reason I bought it ! So I sent in a ticket for support via Lacie 's online web support and so far what we have deduced is that there is not enough ` buspower ' for my brand new Macbook pro to power this little drive and I now supposedly have to buy an additional `` usb power sharing '' cable from Lacie . The Lacie rep said they include it with every drive ... but be warned this cable is not included with this drive . And now I 'm forced into another purchase if I want to use it on my Macbook pro . I 've requested that Lacie send me this cable since I had no idea I needed it , and since their rep said it was included with every drive ... but we 'll see . It does mention inside the box on the back of a card , `` Note : Mobile drives may require additional power . Visit -LRB- ... -RRB- to purchase a USB power cable for improved power . '' Lacie should Note : This is not visible from the outside of the box ! and for their rep this cable is not included . This should also be something that Amazon makes a note of since they do not list this possible requirement anywhere in their description either . If I do get a usb power sharing cable sent to me by Lacie then I would probably throw in another star or 2 but this has been a little frustrating and I 'd just like for people to know what they 're getting . Other than that it seems to work fine although it is still brand new . We 'll see if the usb power sharing cable allows me to use it on my laptop ... Ok I 'm am updating this 2 days later Lacie has been very nice and they suprised me and said that they would be happy to ship me a USB power sharing cable . It 's a bummer that I 've had to wait this long to use it on my Laptop but fortunately I 'm not in a huge pressing need to use it right away . If your in a huge pressing need to buy this and use it on your Mac Laptop do yourself a favor and buy a USB power sharing cable from Lacie unless you can verify that it 's included in the box . Hope that helps . 	HardDrive

Highlights : Look and feel . Cools from topside -LRB- you can lay it anywhere and not worry about it being able to breath \/ cool -RRB- . Durable as He11 Downside : Sucks batteries even when off . 512MB memory limit . S3 16MB video . USB 1.0 SD card reader will not read High Capacity SD cards -LRB- 2gb max -RRB- I found it in the rain next to a dumpster -- victim of an angry divorce -LRB- ex-wife to be destroyed the keyboard stripping keys from it before tossing it in the dumpster pad . I cleaned it up , put the keys back on -LRB- was able to find \/ reinstall all of them -RRB- Wiped the drive , and it worked like a champ . I tried to give it to the church secretary . She is clumsy -- dropped it on a tile floor and kicked it across the hallway trying to recover it . She wound up not needing it , so I took it back . It does accept a mobile cpu . I installed a P4-M 2.2 ghz i got on ebay for $ 20 , and it works faster than most other single core CPU laptops I 've come across . It takes in air from the topside as opposed to the bottom , making a laptop cradle unnecessary -LRB- it will breath even if it 's sitting on a bed . Memory limit of 512MB makes Windows XP SP3 a bit sluggish . Ubuntu Linux 9.10 works great ! It 's so easy to get software on this latest edition of linux . But be forewarned -- 16bit graphics only , for lack of Toshiba modified graphics drivers for this unit . If you have one of these or plan on buying one cheap , just make sure it comes with 512MB of ram , and a 2.0 ghz or faster cpu . Factory shipped internal wireless ` B ' adapter is not suitable for home use , for lack of WPA2 Passphrase support . If it comes with this internal , plan to buy a PC-Card adapter , or the Mini-PCI adapter off ebay mentioned elsewhere in this review . For Wifi , you can get an Atheros mini pci card off ebay from a Toshiba Satellite A45 -LRB- Wireless G MIMO = 108mbs vs 54mbs of the typical adapter \/ internal card . Battery life is average for your typical $ 500 laptop of comparable performance -LRB- 1.5 ~ 2.5 hrs -RRB- . Special note : This laptop has a feature that allows you to turn on the CD subsystem of the Motherboard even if the laptop is off and the lid is closed by pushing one of the multimedia buttons in the front of the case , making this thing function as a dumb CD player . This kills your battery , even when it 's off -- draining a fully charged battery to 0 in a matter of 3 days -LRB- Toshiba really flopped with this one . -RRB- I 've discovered that by sliding the battery out of it 's mounting point just enough for the terminals to break contact for a moment -LRB- laptop off and unplugged -RRB- that the subsystem powers down and battery life is much longer when stored unplugged -LRB- 4 % per night -RRB- . I 'd say if you can get your hands on one for $ 80 ~ 120 , and it 's cosmetically and mechanically in good shape , it 's a good deal for someone looking to run office apps , journal , develop software , or just web browsing under Ubuntu Linux -- especially since it can take so much abuse . `` Take it on a hike ... if nothing else , you can use it as a seat or a hammer to drive tent stakes with . '' It 's cheap enough to not worry too much about , dragging it places it might get stolen or damaged . To sum it up : Unless it has 512MB system ram , 2.0 GHZ for faster Pentium 4 Mobile , and a 30 gig 5400rpm hard drive , it 's useless for anything . It 's not worth the cost of upgrading if you 're about to buy one with less . This thing has taken a beating that would have killed just about any other laptop , yet it performs flawlessly . Microsoft has updated XP till with less than 1GB of system ram , XP is nearly as clunky as Vista , but under the newest version of Ubuntu Linux -LRB- 9.10 -RRB- it surpasses Vista utility and old XP performance despite its 512MB system ram limit , but you give up 24bit graphics . Wifi performance is nice with an Ahteros mini-pci adapter out of a Toshiba Satellite A45 . It 's very comfortable to work with , like the comfortable ink pen you 'd rather buy refills for than replace . For a $ 120 , you 'd probably be happy with it if you 're looking for a cheap laptop to Journal with , browse the web , manage email and office work , keep in the trunk , or to leave behind in the locker at work . Do n't let someone sell you one for more . 	HardDrive
This product was received on time and just as specified in the description . This drive works perfectly for backing up my imac and it is the second one we have purchased . I would recommend this product . 	HardDrive
I had the archos 6GB player\/recorder for just a couple of days . It was very neat while it worked though : -RRB- did not have much trouble getting it setup and transferring files , listening to music etc. . The user manual does not help much much is probably quite sufficient for people using digital gadgets . It is definitely much smaller than the Nomad and I chose it for the form factor . The complaint I have is that it just stopped working abruptly after a couple of days . Started displaying a message saying that there was a hardware error . So I just had it returned . And this was without even having done any jogging\/any thing out of the normal that would cause shock to the player . On the whole , I would definitely love to have this product if only it worked reliably . . 	HardDrive
Nice little netbook but as powerful as most computers . Battery life is very short , 2hrs form 80 % , but I have ordered the larger capacity battery and hopefully there will be 3-4 hrs on that 7800mah vs 4000mah . Based on some of the other reviews I uninstalled the ELAN driver for the touchpad and the delay is gone . I am glad it was this easy because I was getting really tired of the poor responsiveness . With this fix and hopefully much longer battery life , this is a really good value at $ 350 . 	HardDrive
After having these headphones for about a year , yesterday they broke when I simply took them off my head ! I only use them for gaming at home . They do sound good , but for the price of these headphones , they should be made of better material . Do a google search and you 'll find others who 's headphones have also broke . I 'll never buy another pair of Bose headphones again . 	Headphone
Nice fit , retractable cord , good noise canceling but not great but for the price how can you complain . 	Headphone
These headphones are a steal for the price range . I was thoroughly impressed with its noise canceling ability . I always use these in the library on campus to drown out the sound of the idiots who come there to socialize . It does get somewhat uncomfortable after extended use , however . 	Headphone
I really like these for watching my TV . I do n't use them too much for music though . Distortion and signal interference is a little too distracting . 	Headphone
Overpriced , overpackaged and very uncomfortable . I was almostinsulted at how bad they were . With all the other hassles , i did not even care if they sounded good . Assebling the earpieces was like doing brain surgery . Lame . You can do way better for much less money . Try Jbuds for 20 $ . 	Headphone
Ive had these for a couple days and there sick , im very big on my music . There great for all types of music just adjust the eq levels , worth every cent , i love v moda im never onna change brands . 	Headphone
The most amazing property of these headphones is that it 's almost like you 're wearing nothing . They 're light and comfortable and the pressure of the ear pads is adjustable on both sides . These are probably the most comfortable headphones I 've ever worn and I 've owned many sets of headphones from Sony , Panasonic , Seinheiser , Ultrasone ... The extra set of head pads above the ears reduces the pinching on the ears you get with most headphones . That said , the sound quality -LRB- here I 'm using the word ` quality ' literally , as in flavor , not how good the sound is -RRB- is punchy and bass-y , at the sacrifice of high end and midrange . I tested these headphones with a Sony Hi-MD lossless minidisc player with a FLAC audio source . These headphones are what I would call `` teenager headphones . '' They have sound properties that kids would look for . If you listen to a lot of music that has valuable high frequency sound properties you may wish to look elsewhere . The high and midrange on these headphones is a little muddy . 	Headphone
I got these earphones for $ 5 , and it was definitely worth it . They 're pretty good and have nice sound quality -LRB- at least as good as the iPod earphones but probably a bit better -RRB- . They have a weird bump on them to try and make them fit in your ear better which gets annoying at times but overall they are n't bad . so if you 're looking for some decent earphones and want to spend a small amount of money , I would recommend these . 	Headphone
So I bought a pair and received them today . I was happy with the packaging and all but all I 'm really concerned about is that the `` L '' and `` R '' symbols are both written towards the inside of the little square metal pieces -LRB- towards where the bud faces your ear for each earpiece instead of towards the back of them -RRB- . I do n't know if this is an indication that its fake or something , but the Beats symbol is also a little scratched . The zipper on my case has already had paint chips , also , is the warranty really 3 years ? Does anyone else have the same problem ? Does these problems indicate that these headphones are fake ? 	Headphone
I wanted something to control my iPhone in the car without having to continuously unlock the screen and press on-screen buttons while driving . This thing does exactly that for me . I can skip songs and pause the music whenever I want without having to take my eyes off the road . I agree with other reviewers that it would be nice to have the headphones plug directly into the remote , but it 's a very minor complaint . This was a purchase I would gladly recommend to a friend . 	Headphone
Great sound , comfortable though they pinch my ears a bit after more than an hour . 	Headphone
I run . I sweat . I am not being paid by Philips corporate headquarters to write this review . I too have spent somewhere in the hundreds trying to find that perfect , does n't slide out of my ear after a mile , with good sound quality headphone . Well sadly enough , these are not it . The sound is embarrassing -LRB- which is not why I bought them -RRB- , the headphones start to slide as soon as you are ready to run some distance , and you might be thinking : How do a pair of headphones slide when they are ear clipped on ? Low and behold , this set has managed to do so . And once they have started to slip , it 's over ... it 's all over . In my experience , there is no way to get them comfortably back on , even if you have dried them . The sound is even worse than before if I even bother to dry them mid-run , they wont fit snug again in my ear if they have to be taken off mid-run , and they have this ridiculously long cord , long enough to hang myself out of frustration . I always knew Philips made crap electronics , but I was willing to try anything , I have about ten or fifteen pairs and they are all lame . The best pair I have had , have been a Sony pair , that were not even sports edition , or waterproof , or anything -LRB- they were however expensive -RRB- . If you are considering buying this product , I would keep looking , there are better choices out there , although more expensive ... consider what you will spend on this pair and then another pair , and spend about that amount to begin with . Or just by a pair of cheapo Skull Candy headphones , they are about as sport friendly as these . Good luck . Sorry Philips , I had to tell the truth . 	Headphone
These headphones perform wonderfully , especially considering their low price . I have listened to rock , pop , country , and classical music , and these phones have sounded great in all genres . However , after extended wear , they began to cause me outer ear pain where my ear touched the interior part of the headphone . I have since switched my primary headphones to the Sennheiser PX100 . 	Headphone
"</div> <spanclass=""tiny""> Length : : 1:05 Mins </span> "	Headphone
This is by far the best pair of earphones I have ever had . My first pair broke and I didnt hesitate to spend the asking price for a new pair . They are great for working out . They wont fall out and they dont hurt your ear like the other earphones do -LRB- after extensive wear -RRB- . Also this is the best quality sound I have heard for the price and the size . Its just perfect for me and it even matches my pink nano ipod . 	Headphone
With a price like this , one ca n't really expect to have excellent quality headphones or comfortable ear pads , but Sennheiser proves this wrong . First of all , the head strap is on TOP of your head and not BEHIND . This allows you to lean back in a chair or lie down while listening to music which is something I enjoy . The ear pads enclose your ears in a way that no sound escapes and it produces bass sounds that no normal speakers can make . These are indeed bulkier than earbuds , but are well worth the weight . Actually , the weight of these are pretty light compared to most other ear enclosed headphones which make them great for almost anything . These probably are n't the best for running with -LRB- however I find it pointless to run while listening to music because a car might hit you -RRB- , but if you do happen to run with them , they WILL stay on your head . These are n't your normal flimsy 8 $ pair , but for the cost of what they are , the stability and quality sound is more than well worth the bargain . I use these mainly for my desktop computer in which I use Winamp , FL Studio , Audacity , Skype , Windows Live Messenger , web browsing , and various games . I 've never worn anything better . There 's only one small flaw that does n't really matter , but after a lot of wear , the headphones will take shape and wo n't compress onto your head as much as they had when you first bought them . Lastly , a comfortable length of cord comes with this great pair of headphones along with a connector for an amp . All I can say is that there 's never been a day where I did n't want them . 	Headphone
The noise cancellation feature is quite impressive . I was making myself deaf from using in-ear headphones with my iPhone to drown out the noise in a moderately loud office . With the NC300B I can lower the overall volume to safe levels , and I can listen to something other than punk or hard rock and it still blocks the chatter . Good quality headphones at a good price . I paid roughly $ 100 . 	Headphone
Purchased because of posotive reviews . Hooked it up and have been constantly dissapointed . CONSTANT INTERFERENCE . I quute literally can not get it to operate with hissing or popping or whining . Tried everything from changing the frequency its operating on to moving the transmitter . Dissapointed 	Headphone
OK ... so here goes another comparison between the Koss Portpros and the Sennheiser 100 's ? I am not going to bore you . . Both headphones are outstanding performers with an Ipod ... I own them both ... So which one is my preference ? The Sennheisers , for one reason only ... People use their Ipods in malls and on the go . There are times when I want to remove the phones from my ears for a few moments -LRB- say , in a store or when having conversation -RRB- . With the Sennheisers , I can remove the phones from my ears and let them `` hang '' around my neck in comfort ... Try this with the Koss 's and they will place a stranglehold on you . For this reason alone , I recommend the Senn 's . Both , in my humble opinion , sound equally good . 	Headphone
i had to return these after one day because they were huge on the ears . there was no way to adjust the headband , so it kept falling off my head . i got irritated so i just returned it . sound quality was pretty good , but i didnt have them long enough to say anything else about this . 	Headphone
These is the best mobile headphones I 've ever used . Not because of sound quality -LRB- which is EXCELLENT -RRB- , but because of fit , price , comfort , lightweight , durability and how it sticks to my head even when running . Not jogging - SPRINTING - as in to catch airplanes and buses . Mine broke the other day after 3 long years of faithful service . If I did n't turn around fast and crush it against my desk while it was folded up in my pocket , it would probably last another 3 years . It sounded great with no buzzing -LRB- even at high volumes -RRB- right up until I broke it . The cord 's length is perfect , I keep my MP3-loaded PocketPC in my left front pants pocket . It 's long enough but not too long , and never catches on anything . As for the phones themselves , they go far enough into the ear to properly point the speakers forward , not merely inward like those annoyingly uncomfortable little bud things do -LRB- how they justify the price for those things , I 'll never know -RRB- . As for allowing outside noise through , they do if you have them turned down low , but I ca n't tell what people are saying when listening to stuff at `` normal '' volume . In other words , they 're just as good as ear buds without the annoying lack of comfort or ability to keep from falling out . They do let LOUD sound in , however , which can disrupt what you 're hearing . For example , loud vehicles like buses driving past you at a bus stop will completely drown out what you 're listening to . Small price to pay for the things sticking to your head like glue in great comfort for hours on end . Sound quality is great . The larger speakers provide for a very well-rounded sound , not just treble and bass like most ear buds . Perfect for anything from music to talk radio . The foldable design is a feature of importance to me because I 'm a long distance commuter by bus and ferry boat -LRB- 4 hours a day -RRB- . Compact , portable and lightweight are very important to me , even more important than sound quality . Fortunately , I did n't have to sacrifice a bit of sound quality by using these over buds . These headphones give great sound , are comfortable , are lightweight , stick to your head even when running , and they 're very compact and portable . And for 10 measly bucks ! You can have those over-rated , expensive buds and all the discomfort and `` fallout '' that goes with them . Did I mention I am here on this web site right now to buy two more pairs of these ? 	Headphone
I have had these headphones for about two years . I want everyone to know that the sound is extraordinary . I still to this day have to check when listening that the volume is not turned up with my wife trying to sleep . The sound is as close to sitting in a movie theater as you are probably going to get . Without the vibration of course . They are everything you could want in realistic sound , comfort , and battery life . This is where my accolades end however . I have noticed another review saying that his broke at the swivel point where they adjust to the shape of your head . The same thing happened to me after about a year . When that happens they just kind of dangle from the head unit -LRB- oh , and yes , I was very careful with them -RRB- Of course this seems to happen after the warranty has expired . Well , I have refused to reward the manufacturer for poor engineering at this point by another purchase . I used epoxy glue and bits of plastic to effect a repair . This was n't bad but I also found that duct tape around that has helped as well . I have been using them for about a year now . Still great sound ! But if you are planning on buying these I think the manufacture could at least include some epoxy glue and duct tape with the purchase . They look stupid perhaps on my head but the sound is great ! 	Headphone
The product was easy to set up and operational within minutes . Despite some background static that was always present , even after tuning , the unit worked okay for several days until it stopped working while I was watching TV . After hearing heavy static , I noticed that the green base light was no longer on . As soon as the headphones were unplugged from the TV , the green light came back on and the unit worked again for a few minutes then went out again ; this reoccurred several times . Perhaps there is an electrical shortage in the base unit . I 'm researching other models and brands for a replacement . I 'm glad that Amazon has an easy postage-free return policy . 	Headphone
I 'm very glad I bought these . They are exactly what I wanted . They do n't tangle . They are very sturdy . And come to find out they have great sound . I normally kept my mp3 player on volume `` 7 '' , but with these I had to turn it down to `` 6 '' . The sound was also more rich . I paid about the same ammount for these as I had my previous 3 sets -LRB- other brand and type -RRB- that I bought from a local store and these blow those away , not to mention those all ended up tearing up . Oh yeah , they are very comfortable . Just put on the appropriate ear pieces that suit you and you 'll end up forgetting they are in . 	Headphone
I found that these earbuds sound very good . The cord is a little of a problem keeping untangled . But I think you have that problem with most earbuds . Otherwise they are very comfortable . Just hope they are durable because I did not have them very long yet . But I use them every single day . 	Headphone
I wanted to let everyone know that this is a great item . Perfect for working out or running because now you do n't have to deal with the wires . I have never seen a wireless set of headphones ! HIGHLY RECOMEND !!!! 	Headphone
The sound is great for a $ 10 earbud but the cord is 6-12 inches short of ideal . 	Headphone
Reasons you should buy this product - The Use : 1 - The ear pads are in general pretty comfortable , however long durations of use may cause some discomfort . 2 - The folding aspect of the headphone works well , it may take some time to get use to , but it is somewhat intuitive . 3 - I 'm afraid the hinge design for the ear pad may not stand the test of time . The connection element is rather weak and I can see that through time , it will be the first thing to break . 4 - The overall finish for the ear pads and its adjacent plastic are acceptable , however , the # 4 finish on the stainless steel head band is a bit rough . The Sound : 1 - The low frequency is very satisfactory considering how small the drivers are , the bass is tight and balanced . 2 - The mid frequency is n't RPXC 250 's strongest suit , so if you are very picky about voice and string music , this is not the one . 3 - The high frequency is in general pretty good . Although slightly harsh when compare to my Grado 60 and AKG 701 , it is generally acceptable as a traveling headset . 4 - As a traveling headset it combines smallness and lightness with a decent quality of sound . The Noise Cancelling capacity : Having compared the PXC250 to the Bose Quietcomfort 3 at an Apple store , I can attest the noise canceling aspect of the PXC works comparable to the Bose product .

Have had this product about a month . Has worked flawlessly . Self-adjusting headband has worked fine . You have option of using rechargeable battery that comes with unit , or if it runs down -LRB- which has n't been an issue yet -RRB- , using alkaline AAs . Sound has been excellent with TV , though if the TV signal is very marginal , there can be noise . Have n't tried with music . Appreciate the power switch on the phones , so I do n't have to put it back in charging unit every night . Also has volume control on phone , though you 'll get cleaner sound using volume control on TV . Ear pads comfortable and I appreciate them not being type that wraps around ears , so I can here my cat getting into trouble , etc. . Good product , especially for price . 	Headphone
This is a good product for the price offered . Although many people do n't use these types of headphones anymore , I believe this is a good choice for use at home . I tend to have problems with the earbuds being too big or constantly falling out , but these headphones are good to go when you hood them on your head ! 	Headphone
First , the good part . These are the second set of Jensen headphones I 've purchased . They 're a very good value compared to some of the others I 've tried . The downside is that the signal will very slowly drift over the life of the batteries , but usually a slight tap of the tuning knob will bring it back . The newer models like this one appear to have better signal aquisition , so this may solve some of the drift problems I saw in older models . Battery life is pretty good , I usually went through a set every 6-7 days on the old one . -LRB- The old model required 3 AAA 's instead of 2 however -RRB- <p> Now the bad , The production values are rather poor on the electronics in these headphones . My first pair started going rather glitchy on me , sometimes I 'd have to lightly hit the side to get them to find the signal again , and the battery life started going down drastically . It also would rapidly lose signal when it had this problem . I took them apart and noticed that the soldering job was quite substandard , and there were several uninsulated speaker wires that were shorting out . After putting some insulation in on the board , the headphones started working perfectly . I took these apart after I recieved them and noticed the same problem . The headphone was also popped loose from its plastic fitting due to substandard glue . Both easily fixable if you 're good with electronics . 	Headphone
The Grado SR-60s are , without question , the best headphones I 've ever owned . I would n't go so far as to call myself an audiophile , but I appreciate great sound , and these headphones deliver that in spades . They have a very rich , balanced sound , with glittering highs , silky , powerful mids , and accurate , tight lows . Many people seem to consider Grados `` rock '' headphones , but , to be honest , everything I 've listened to on these has sounded great . Electronica , metal , post-rock , indie rock , classical music ... these headphones really `` do '' every single genre , and well . The only problems are so minimal that they 're hardly worth mentioning . The cable is very thick , and the design does n't exactly ooze style . I would n't recommend them for purely portable listening . Many reviewers seem to think they 're uncomfortable , but I find the slightly cupped , padded earphones to be very cozy . It 's mostly a matter of personal preference , I suppose . I 've also heard headphones with `` fatter '' sounding bass , so anyone with that as a priority might want to upgrade to the Grado SR80s , or hunt around some more . Another reviewer called these `` studio '' headphones , which is n't really true . I 'm using these with my iPod , and it 's never sounded better . In all honesty , these headphones are practically a steal at their current price point -- I 've heard headphones costing twice as much that do n't sound nearly as good as these do . Sennheiser , Sony , and Bose do n't have anything on these Brooklyn-crafted wonders . Compared to something like iPod earbuds , it 's simply night and day . Do yourself a favor and pick these up -- you wo n't regret it ! 	Headphone
I originally received these headphones as a Christmas gift and fell in love with them : the neckband design I prefer , thick quality foaming over each earphone , and a durable string over the wiring -LRB- rather than the typical rubber -RRB- . While the reflective coating on the neckband had a tendency to be easily scratched off and the original pair snapped in half from an awkward snag while placing in a backpack -LRB- to be fair , at three in the morning when I was very uncoordinated -RRB- , I liked it enough to go online and buy it when no other stores had it in stock . 	Headphone
They fit perfect , they sound clear , these buds have a great blend of bass , mids and highs ... The build quality is excellent . For the price ... these earbuds are a great value in my opinion . Noise cancellation is almost perfect ... Just make sure you fit them properly to your ear ... I 'll be keeping these pair . . 	Headphone
I do lots of cycling as well as weight training and always use earbuds to help the time pass . I have 5 different sets of buds and this Panasonic set is my least favorite . The highs are clear and well defined but they have zero and I mean zero bass . All four of my other buds have better bass response although all are not as clear . If you really like treble with little bass these are the buds for you but if you like metal or rock these are weak . I do like the ear pieces as they do stay put , just ca n't listen to the `` tinny '' sound these produce . 	Headphone
I bought this product for my husband to use at night so I could sleep while he watches TV . It works great ! He said the quality of the sound is very good and easy to use . 	Headphone

THE SENNHEISER PMX SPORT IS ABSOLUTLEY GREAT FOR ALL USES , INDOORS AND OUT . VERY COMFORTABLE TO WEAR AND GREAT SOUND . DO NOT HINDER IN ANY WAY AN ACTIVITY . 	Headphone
the folding thing is easy and it is very handy having the plastic case . the sound is very good , not excellent though ... especially on the lows , I have never tried the porta pros , so I ca n't compare , I bought a $ 20.00 pair of Sony 's that were so bad they were unusable before purchasing these . I use them for mostly for running , they sound good , they stay in place , what more can you ask ... , well , OK , a little better reproduction and accuracy on the low end . 	Headphone
The Vmoda earbuds make for decent in-ear phones at a reasonable price , but compared to similarly priced headphones , the bass is loose and overpowers much of the mids and highs . Otherwise , they 're attractive , seem to be reasonably well build and the cables do n't have excessive microphonics like some other sets . Mostly the audio quality is sub-par , even in this range of headphones . 	Headphone
I just received it today and I see no problems , and hear no problems . I used this so I can play my piano keyboard without anyone else hearing and for that purpose I have no issues . 	Headphone
What I like about these headphones is the comfort . They come with ear pieces in various sizes ; it was easy to find one that fit my ears well and did n't pop out easily . The cord is a good length to connect with my iPod in my pocket or on my desk . My son , a 17-year-old audiophile , was far more impressed by the sound quality than he had been by the more-expensive set he bought at the Apple store . 	Headphone
Sound : Great range and pretty flat signature , but not the most precision nor the biggest soundstage . Looks : Laying non your desk or hanging around your neck , these look phenomenally retro . On your head , they can be pretty bulbous -LRB- I would have preferred the flatter design of the old SR-60s -RRB- . Comfort : Not as comfortable as around-ear phones nor smaller on-ears , and the hard vinyl band will irritate a thinly-haired head , but nothing major to complain about . They are somewhat adjustable by bending the headband . Durability : I cant imagine these will ever break or wear out . Grado is also well-known for their repair service , so you 're covered Not exactly designed to be portable , it has a huge cable -LRB- in all dimensions -RRB- and similarly large jack that does n't want to work with ipod cases -LRB- it can be driven by portable players , though -RRB- . It works great for sedentary use , though , and is comfortable enough to be worn for hours on end . 	Headphone
I recently bought these for a vacation I was going on . Mainly only used them on the airplane . Could use them but the engine noice was very noticable . For the money they did well and in all fairness they preformed as I thought they would . If you looking for headphones that cancel out noice not the headphones for you but if your looking for a reasonable sound under normal conditions their not bad . 	Headphone
Its neat ! A set of very comfortable headphones , which completely surrounds and caresses your ears ! Incredibly lightweight considering the size ! I wouldnt really like to compare these with Bose or the likes , since Sennheiser is known to make some really quality stuff . I tried a variety of music using these , ranging from soft classical to pop to some really embellished music ... and with each genre I realized that with this pair of Sennheiser , I heard the subtler tunes and finer points which I didnt know existed . Thankfully , the unit comes with a cord winder as a beltclip attachment , which will save you the trouble of tagging along the extra wire or stuffing part of the 6 ft cord into your pockets . I wasnt too happy about the fact that I could hear myself nice and loud when singing along even softly with the music -LRB- would have been pleasant if I had a good voice ! -RRB- But on the brighter side , its as good as Karaoke , aint it ?? Weighing the cost to delivery ratio ... I would definitely recommend it ! 	Headphone
The sound quality is good and the product it self is very good for the price . I use it in work outs and it stays in place which is what i 'm looking for . 	Headphone
These headphones are wonderful . They are the best pair of headphones I have ever owned . I consider myself an audiophile . I have no electronic background but have purchased many high-end pieces of audio equipment over the past 30 years . I currently own several headphones including the AH-D2000 -LRB- I purchased these for my daughter -RRB- and the Ultimate Ears triple . fi10 earbuds to use when I travel . I am sure I would love the AH-D7000 but I felt the $ 600 difference was probably not justifiable . I was able to purchase these for $ 399 . There is a small , but noticeable , sound quality difference between the 2000 and 5000 headphones that I felt the less than $ 200 difference between them was worth it . Bass is deeper without distortion . Treble notes are crisper . Midrange is fuller . Although I can listen to classical music , my preference is classic rock . Pink Floyd Dark Side of the Moon and The Wall sound fantastic . Led Zeppelin is amazing . For those that have commented that these headphones need an external amp to drive them , I disagree . Although the majority of the time I listen to them using my Pioneer Elite receiver and they sound great , I plugged them into my iPod and they sounded very good . The quality of the music was not as full , rich , and `` powerful '' sounding but more than I expected , especially given the reviews I read . I do not know if I would opt for the 5000 over the 2000 if the price differential was over $ 300 -LRB- I 've seen them from $ 399 to $ 699 -RRB- ; but , I felt it was a bargain at the $ 140 difference when I bought them . 	Headphone
I bought these as a replacement for some Motorolla Rokrs that I had bought and stopped functioning . These are comfortable , but less compact because of the rigid plastic framing . It works well if you 're able to store them with the case they come in . I usually have them in my bag . The case is rigid to keep from being crushed . I 'm a little weary of the wiring at the pivot points for the frame . If they get pinched and fray the wiring , then it will be pointless to have purchased these . But for now , they are comfortable and work with a Sony dongle that clips into an iPod 9-pin dock . It pairs easily . 	Headphone
These things are crazy durable , and the non tangle cords work great , the sound quality is just ok . But these if you need some really tough head phones . 	Headphone
Sounds is incredible . Fit is great . I use them for jogging with my EVO android phone MP3 player . No problems with them falling out . Best quality music I 've heard in decades . Extremely happy with these buds . Pure quality , awesome sound quality . 	Headphone
I 've bought at least three sets of these and really like them . I 'm very fussy and have looked at lots of ear buds , but keep coming back to the Sennheisers . The sound quality is excellent , with plenty of volume . The buds are very comfortable . The cord is the perfect length for me -LRB- approx 3 ft -RRB- . The volume control on the cord is very handy . I particularly like the case . I have a pair of Sony earbuds whose cord becomes a tangled mess in no time . The Sennheisers come with an ingenious compact plastic case that reels in the cord quickly and easily . Here are the specs from the package : Freq . Resp . 18 - 22K Hz , Imped . 32 ohms , Max SPL 119bd -LRB- @ 1 khz 0.5 Vrms -RRB- . 	Headphone
These earbuds are great . I 've been looking for a decent pair of earbuds to use with my iPod while cutting the grass . These do an excellent job of blocking out the mower noise without having to crank the volume up . 	Headphone
I had ordered a pair of bluetooth headphones from hp . Only had them a few months and they broke in the middle . Tried to get them replaced but they could n't do that so I went on line to find something else and the logitech pair looked ok so I bought them . Great ! Strong ! Sound is great . Pairing easy . Just what I wanted . 	Headphone
Bought them for my husband he is very satisfied with their power and clarifity would recommend them great set of headphone for the price . 	Headphone
these headphones and others -LRB- in some different colors , and design -RRB- can be found at your local dollar stores . thats a savings of 88 cents . so get and up go there ! 	Headphone
I just returned from a repeat air trip to England , and was hoping for a more restful -LRB- read that more sleep with fewer distractions from crying children and the coughing lady in the next seat -RRB- trip through the use of these Philips headphones . I found that the noise canceling feature did decrease the droning ambient sounds to a somewhat helpful extent . Other cabin sounds were still intrusive . The sound quality did not seem much better than the airline-supplied headset and the product seems to be quite cheaply made . My biggest concerns were : 1 -RRB- That the headphone pads had to be positioned carefully to derive any benefit from the noise canceling feature , which meant that I had to keep my head straight to not push on the neckband . Also , my neck pillow tended to push on the neckband and degrade performance . Bother . 2 -RRB- My -LRB- admittedly generous -RRB- auricles just plain hurt after a few hours of use , and I had to take the headset off . I did buy a pair of noise-cancelling earbuds to address these two issues , and this approach has worked well . For instance , consider one of the Sure earbuds . 	Headphone
I ordered 2 pairs , black\/orange for myself and silver\/green for my wife , as replacements for our ipod earbuds -LRB- yes , we are yuppies -RRB- . I have to say , the MDQ-Q23LP look really cool , as you can probably tell by looking at them online . However , that 's where the positive aspects end . They are physically uncomfortable . I made sure I put them on right . I can see how I could eventually get used to the jabbing behind the ear , but why should I. What I could never get used to is the flat sound . I was not expecting studio quality out of this design in this price-range but I was neither expecting the 2-can , 99-cent store , flatness . Playing with the EQ on the ipod helped somewhat , but not very much . Finally , I ca n't stand it when I can hear people 's music through their earphones over the subway noise , 12 feet away . I do n't mean the tsk-tsk-tsk or an occasional sax . I mean when you can actually hear the lyrics . I think MDQ-Q23LP is one of those headphones . I did all sorts of sound tests and even at half the volume -LRB- much too quiet for my taste -RRB- they were extremely noisy on the outside . Again , I was not expecting the type of sound isolation you get out of earbuds or the noise-cancelling headphones , but give me a break ... these babies give the term `` sharing music '' a new meaning . I 'll let my wife deside about her pair , but I 'm sending mine back . Too bad , they look great -LRB- hence 2 stars -RRB- . 	Headphone
The headphone broke in two on the third use . Probably just bad luck , but I returned it as well as the second headphone I ordered for my husband . Returning the items was painless , thanks so much . 	Headphone
I 'm into quality , and that 's what you will get from these Technics headphones . I 'm not a DJ , but I know these headphones work great for home listening . The volume can be turned up without any distortion at all . You may even want to record your mp3s at higher bitrates because you will be able to hear the difference between 128 and 256 . The headphones are very well designed and comfortable . I find it hard to stop listening to them because I like them so much . The coiled cord stays out of the way . These headphones may be a little too bulky to wear walking down the street , but they are well worth their price . They also block out many ouside noises and other people in the room can not hear the music you play at normal levels . This product will truly provide a new listening experience . 	Headphone
After reading and looking at reviews online , I thought I found the perfect headphones for the gym , I love the Soul by Ludacris SL150 for their full sound but there are a little too bulky for gym . These M-80 's are pretty compact , they look amazing , the materials are top notch and feel very durable . Now on to the disappointing part : the sound . Reviews hail these headphones as `` amazing sounding '' , so since I listen to a variety of music genres , I was excited to try them . I know there is a break-in period of probably 24hrs so for an entire week , I plugged them to my PC and had iTunes playing all night at 1\/4 volume . The sound is still flat and dull , I have to change the settings to `` bass booster '' to get a decent sounding bass , even on dance and hip hop tracks . All in all , I will keep these because they are so compact but when I 'm home , I grab my SL150 's . UPDATE : Well , I guess I did n't give it enough time to break-in or something was loose inside the headphones but all of sudden , they came alive ! the highs and mids are clearer and the lows can now be felt . Sorry about my initial poor review Mr. Kolton , you built a great headphone . 	Headphone
Unless you are man with very large ears , these ear hooks will do nothing for you . Everyone in my office tried these on and only a guy with abnormally large ears could keep them on for more than a few seconds . 	Headphone
Great for running and cycling - the earphones do n't budge no matter how much moving you do . Basic exercises like running and cycling do nothing to shake them . There 's a part that goes over the ear like a web that 's made of soft rubber material which is a key feature for its comfort and prolonged wearability . These are not exactly audiophile earphones , but you get used to them . If your mp3 player has a user adjustable eq then all the better . I 've heard better earphones , but these are pretty good . Clearly some compromise has been made , but they seem to have come out on the good side of acceptable . They do n't rest flatly in the cavum conchae , braced by the tragus and antitragus , as with standard fontopoid style phones , but are instead held in place by the plastic band at an inwardly directed angle . This is a step in the right direction in terms of comfort and stayputiveness . It seems that because they sit halfway outside the cavum conchae , the phones were made larger for greater efficiency and output to make up for the slightly increased distance from the ear canal . I think they 're a little bit too big , but again it takes getting used to the position as well as the audio range . The yellow wire is a nice aesthetic touch , but the black jackets on both the 1\/8 '' plugs feel like they might pull right up the wire when removing them from the player or the volume control . Have to be careful with them ... Overall they 're a very clever design which has in my opinion completely solved the problem of earphone migration . Never again will I reach up during a blissful run to shove that fontopoid back into my ear , and I 'm looking forward this summer to taking it fully for granted . If the next generation of these headphones has slightly smaller earbuds with more exotic sound quality , I 'll promptly wear them . 	Headphone
For the price this is a fantastic earbuds . Very stylish , and good isolation as long as you are not on the train too much . The noise from the train could leak in , but you will still be able to hear your music well without pumping the volume . 	Headphone
As one who is very particular when it comes to sound quality AND overall quality , I can only highly recommend this product . I have owned several other wireless headsets by different manufacturers only to be disappointed . This Sony headset is by far one of the best I 've had . The headset itself only LOOKS cheap at first glance , but is actually very lightweight and easy to use . The sound quality is much better than expected and I get perfect reception-I have not experienced ANY hiss or static whatsoever . A major plus is that you simply hook it up , turn it on and enjoy it-no searching for channels , no adjusting this or that-nothing . I also like the fact that you can use the included rechargable battery or normal AAA batteries in this unit . Overall , I am extremely happy with this purchase and would encourage anyone else in the market for a product like this to buy it ... NOW ! 	Headphone
I love anything by Bose , but the price for these headphones are not marked down from the listed price -LRB- the Bose site has them listed at the same price that Amazon considers `` discounted '' -RRB- 	Headphone
Good ear buds\/phones they are a little weird to get use to . The angle of the earpieces are a bit confusing and i get them mixed up once and a while . Great sound isolation and good sound . They havent broken yet so we 'll see how long they last . 	Headphone
Sound quality is quite good considering the item 's low price , bass comes through great and the headphones only fault is shown when music is at a very high frequency for a long period of time . The cords actually do prevent tangles , are a decent length , do n't hinder music when rubbing against clothing , and look good . The purchase also includes a great compact carrying case which holds several sizes of ear buds -LRB- 5 pairs in total -RRB- . Once the proper seal around your ear has been made these headphones will sound great and provide an amazing value for all sorts of buyers highly recommended . 	Headphone
Sennheiser used to make excellent products . They `` improved '' their line of wireless RF headphones so that now it is very difficult to use and produces poor sound qualities -- and , as a bonus , fails to work at all more often than not . Because I was very busy , I kept the product too long to return . I 'd be pleased if Amazon would let me return it for a refund -- and maybe even help me find one of Sennheiser 's old , excellent products . 	Headphone
I just got them and they are super comfortable . I almost ca n't feel them around my ear . Great bass response ... just all around great product . 	Headphone
It may just be the specific pair I received but the construction quality of these headphones are terrible . The play\/pause button on my headset was already broken upon arrival and the call button broke after a few hours of light use . They are very comfortable though . 	Headphone
The headphones work really well out of the box , with better sound quality than the earbuds that come with the iphone . However , I experienced malfunction of the volume control after an indoor run on the treadmill -LRB- 10K -RRB- ; perhaps some moisture got into the wiring ? After drying , it again became functional . A rather unexpected problem , since one of the touted qualities is water resistance . Outdoor running does n't seem to cause the same problem . It happened again after a shorter run -LRB- 5K -RRB- , again on the treadmill indoors . I guess the sweat gets into the control stick and temporarily renders it nonfunctional . Overall , I got less than what I expected from a rather pricy headset . 	Headphone
For the price I bought the headphones for they 're acceptable and work well enough . The biggest problem I 've had so far is that for some reason the signal seems to be interfering with my wireless internet . My internet connection does n't work within the range of the docking station for the headphones , and as soon as I turn off the unit my internet connection is fine again . I mostly watch movies and TV shows through the internet , so this is a problem for me . Otherwise they work fine and are comfortable enough . If you do n't need to use the internet while you are using the headphones then they 're a good price for what you get . And it 's nice to be able to charge the headphones instead of having to put in new batteries . 	Headphone
"I am a huge Sony guy , but these are some of the worst headphones I have tried . The bass is often overwhelming , the construction is shoddy at best , the plastic cheap and uncomfortable , and they are UGLY ! They are huge and do n't adjust well . The sound switch on the ears is foolish and useless -LRB- makes no difference -RRB- . They are extremely uncomfortable , especially on the top of the head . I returned these and bought the latest Sennheiser HD202 headphones which blow these away for about the same price . BUY SENNHEISER HD202 instead !!! Trust me ! <ahref=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000065BP9/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/188-7187332-4957954""> Sennheiser HD 202 Headphones </a> I love your TVs , cameras , PS3 , and laptops Sony ... but you dropped the ball on these ! "	Headphone
This product does just fine as headphones but not noise canceling . I recommend an over the ear product . Unfortunately these headphones made me have to buy the Bose noise canceling headphones . If this vendor offers another product that is fully over the ear , I would recommend it before I would this pair that just sits on the ear , maybe they would be better then . 	Headphone
This Radio is total poop ! It worked great for 2 months , and then all of a sudden , the slightest breeze would cause the thing to shut off . At first it would turn back on and if I was able to hit the lock switch before it shut off it would stay on ... until I wanted to change the station and had to unlock the darn thing and `` poof '' gone . After a couple of days of these shenanigans , it would shut off as soon as I turned on it on , lock trick or no lock trick . End of the tunes , DONE ! And to think , I was anti-Sony !!! Panasonic was a good name but I wo n't buy anything they make anymore . I bought a phone from them that came with a faulty battery , returned it twice and finally bought a good battery and it 's worked great ever since but come on !!! The thing was brand new !!! 	Headphone
Before purchasing this product , I 've been reading about people recommending the Sennheiser HD555 's and whatnot and it concerned me if the AD700 's were really the better deal . What I really wanted was a set of headphones that could be used for gaming and watching movies\/listening to music in general . As soon as the headphones arrived I was blown away by the soundstage that it carried . I play games such as CS 1.6 and previously with my old headphones I could hear the general location of where things were , and with these new headphones I could hear the precise location of where every grenade landed , to the extent that it shocked me . As I was grinding the headphones in for the first few hours the sound quality seemed a little weak at first , but as soon as a week or two passed by the sound became amazing . I enjoy these headphones so much that even as I am wearing them I feel like I 'm listening to my surround sound speakers . A thing to note that it was hard to adjust to the switch of using headphones mainly compared to speakers -LRB- as I did n't realize how loud the headphones actually were since I forgot that I was using headphones and not the speakers , meaning the loud sounds you get at that close range might be dangerous -RRB- . All in all , the headphones are fantastic and worth the money , as I doubt I will be needing any new replacements in the future . Oh and , the appearance of the headphones in person does n't look as cheap as it seems on the pictures you see ; actually , they seem like high-class headphones , a luxurious set of headphones made with lovely material that makes you feel like a king . 	Headphone
I 've spent all day revisiting my music collection . This is an excellent pair of headphones for the price . One note to potential buyers : Sennheiser PX 100 's are open headphones , which means you will hear sounds in your environment and , depending on the volume , others will hear what you are listening to . 	Headphone
I use them to play with the Xbox 360 and they work very well . The surround effect works great giving you the front rear separation in the games . And for 13 bucks they were a bargain . I 'm no expert and I suppose that there are headphones that give you the best quality surround sound but for playing at night and do n't wake everybody in the house they work great . I do n't see the point of giving you the rechargeable battery option since one will probably have them plugged in next to the xbox , tv , dvd , etc. . 	Headphone
I recently picked up the Aiwa CN5 headset from radio shack -LRB- ~ $ $ $ -RRB- and was pleasantly surprised at how a low-cost NC headset could perform . I also use higher-end ones when flying my plane , but they are WAY too bulky for portable electronics -LRB- CD\/DVD -RRB- on commercial flights . Anyway , Aiwa headset sounds fine , but has no padding on the plastic band which scrapes my hairless head top ! Bring along a felt pad or something or it will get annoying very quickly ! All-in-all , I 'd recommend picking up a set . 	Headphone
Both is already broken I. didnt do . anything to it . but . put it . on and press play the sound . is awsome so . yu think . yu have a good deal but a. 2 weeks later yu want your money back 	Headphone
it REALLY gets hot under the earpads . After about 5 minutes , you 'll have to lift the headphones off your head to allow for some air to circulate around your ears . To make sure it was n't just an isolated issue , I had others use these headphones as well . They gave the headphones back to me within a few minutes with the same complaint ... uncomfortably hot around the ears . I 've had these headphones for about a year . The audio fidelity is great . I use them to get a full appreciation of songs I really want to listen to . Unfortunately , these are too uncomfortable -LRB- heat-wise -RRB- to use for more than a song or two at a time . It 's really a shame , considering the sound produced by this headphone is exceptional . The highs are crisp , the mids are defined and the lows are accurate , yet powerful . For day-to-day headphones , I use the Sony MDR-EX71 earbuds . They sound OK , but you can really tell the difference going from earbud -LRB- with tiny 9mm drivers -RRB- to the HD 497 . There 's no substitute for size when it comes to drivers . Also , unlike some higher-end headphones that require more power , these headphones do not require additional amplification for use with items , such as the iPod . As much as I like these headphones for their sound , I find it too uncomfortable to use regularly . This headphone is ideal for the following combined conditions : 1 -RRB- for use with personal audio player 2 -RRB- in cold environment , where the headphone can double as earmuffs . Also , the cord is extremely long and does not detach from the headset . The earpads do detach . It 'll be great if I can find replacement earpads that allow more air to circulate and heat to dissipate around the ear area . 	Headphone
I really have to say that for this price , you usally think you ca n't get too much of a good piece of equipment , but that is not always true . These are great headphones , especially if all you use them for is for now and then , the n they really serve their purpose . Now if you want some super duper acoustic marvelous headphones then buy those that cost you 300 bucks and up . 	Headphone
good radio , excellent sound . only complaint is once you put the arm band on , you ca n't adjust the volume easily because its `` locked '' so it wo n't move as you run . You pretty much have to remove the radio from your arm and adjust the volume because of the locking tab . Other than that , its a decent radio . 	Headphone
As far as connectivity and sound goes , this headphones are great . Price\/performance is magnificent . When it comes to design : they just kill my ears ! I can just wear them for a few minutes . Every time I use them , my ears will hurt until the next day . Poor design . They should 've given them a little bit more room and put some cushion on top . 	Headphone
I have purchased this brand in the past and have been very happy with the sound and durability . I use these to listen to my mp3 player while working out and the fit is perfect . Sadly , the connection from this pair to my player seems to create more static and the sound goes in and out during listening . Because they were so cheap , I did buy two pairs and will switch to the other pair soon . Hopefully , it is just a glitch in my current headphones and the other pair will function as others have in the past . 	Headphone
The headphones worked perfectly the first time I used them . Put them back on the cradle to charge . The next time I went to use them , all I got was hissssss . Called Sennheiser . The problem was everything under the sun ... but the headphones : I did n't have the volume turned up loud enough , I apparently was incompetent to scan through the dial from one end to the other , I did n't have them plugged in correctly , blah blah BS ! BS ! blah ! Was told to return the product ; would be 2 to 3 weeks turnaround for either repair or replace . I shipped them to Sennheiser . No word if they ever received them . No word if there 's a prognosis . No word if there 's going to be a fix . No word if and when I might get them back . No word , period ! Communication sucks ! I emailed them , got a generic reply stating that it would be 4 weeks turnaround . If you 're thinking you 're getting these at a good price , tack on an extra $ 9.35 cost to ship them back to Sennheiser . 	Headphone
I purchased the Koss PRO-100 on a whim because the Sennheiser that I wanted were out of stock . I usually do my homework but I trusted the reviews . I was thoroughly disappointed with the lack there of bass response . I 'm glad I bought these in store because paying return shipping would have angered me immensely . The mid rang and highs are average at best . At 79 dollars they are extremely over priced for the sound quality that it produces . 	Headphone
Good sound and bass . It picking up a little interference noise from my elliptical machine and expensive . I may go for wire headphone than wireless 	Headphone
To preface this , I 've had these headphones for around a month so far , so they are broken in and have been tested in a variety of situations . As a music producer , I demand high quality , transparent sound reproduction in headphones and speakers , but as an average American , I require these products to be affordable . I 've heard a lot about these PortaPros , so I gave it a shot and ordered some . Looks : These headphones have an 80s retro look to them -- so retro , I 'm afraid to go out with these , wary that women passing by might point and laugh at me . I did n't get these to strut around with , but if that 's your plan , I would n't recommend it . I personally love the old school look , though . Construction : At first when I opened up the packaging , it surprised me how small these things are . It dawned on me that I may have to replace them soon . . the metal band looked too thin , the foam pads appeared to be flimsy and the cord I felt would snap with minor tugging . I was wrong ... I have put these through a lot so far this month : I 've thrown them , worn them in 30 degree weather , sat on them , stretched them out too far , yet nothing seems to phase these ! No wonder they have been in production for more than 25 years . Sound : HUGE . Anything plays well on these : Rock , Americana , Two-Step , IDM ... really , anything . I am astounded by how loud and clear these little headphones can be . In Audacity , I made a sweeping tone and found that the PortaPros cover the entire frequency spectrum with ease . I do n't have much else to say , these headphones deliver . Get them . They are comfortable , portable -LRB- duh -RRB- , crisp , clear and CHEAP . 	Headphone
I currently use a Sony in-ear headphone that was about $ 45 and has good audio quality until walking about ten steps and they begin to slip out . Needless to say , this made working out with them really annoying as I am constantly pushing them back in . So I thought these headphones would be good since they hook around your ear . Lets start with the good : The headphones come with a lot of ear tips to help give you a good secure fit . I find -LRB- as well as many of the other reviewers -RRB- the foam tips to be the best fit and most comfortable . When securely fit the headphones do provide good sound with rich highs and mids and at least descent bass . Now the bad : Although the headphones never outright come out thanks to the fact that it hooks around your ear , the suction is slowly lost which results is a weaker bass and overall sound . Now I did not find it to be terribly bad and I did n't have to retouch it too many times -LRB- maybe every 15min -RRB- which is far better than any other in-ear headphone I 've ever used , and to be fair occasionally I did n't have to touch it for much longer . What really bothered me was after just two days I noticed the cord was already failing . The sound quality would vary just from moving the cord in a certain way . In addition , the controls stopped responding on my iPhone for about an hour until it worked again . That may be okay if I had it for two years but not two days . I thought for $ 75 I could purchase a quality headphone with no problems . I 'm afraid I 'm going to have to return it and I will likely be getting the Monster iSport Immersion In-Ear Headphones . 	Headphone
I have been using this headphone for last 3-4 weeks . Nice headphone with clear sound at very low price . Recommend it to anyone looking for a cheap but good quality headphone . 	Headphone
I am sorry to say that the general comments about these headphones appear to be true . I was after some circum-aural , closed back , reasonably priced and reasonably balanced headphones and these ticked all the boxes . The sound was great , the cable was long enough for my needs , it comes with a pouch to store them in when you 're not wearing them and they look pretty great too . The major flaw with this product is that these headphones are so tight that they soon become unbearable to wear . The band is very small and tightly sprung and by the time half hour has passed and I 've had these pressing against the side of my head I had a headache and felt slightly nauseous . Not ideal conditions to say the least . I wear glasses and having the arms of them pressed against my skull was unbearable , but even when I tried these with my glasses off it was still too uncomfortable . I even tried a few days with these stretched over a box whenever I was n't wearing them and whilst this helped very slightly , it was never comfortable enough to wear these to enjoy my music . The packaging , as others have noted is atrocious as well , it is a mission to get into these and you need a sharp knife and much care so as not to damage the headphones as you open them . I am disappointed with these , as apart from the one major flaw these are exactly what I was after and after considerable time researching different types of headphone for my requirements these fell short of the mark in the comfort stakes . I sent mine back for a refund , but I 'd still suggest they are worth a try as the other features are so good , just be aware they may be too tight for you . Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page . 	Headphone
The sound is great on these and they block much of the surrounding noise . Having the long cord is nice too . As others have reported , they are too tight and are slightly too small for the ears . I kind of have to tuck my ears in but are not uncomfortable . I do n't think my head or ears are larger than average . What stinks for me is that I paid just under $ 40 in Feb 2012 and now they are less than half that ! I 'll be looking at the newer version to see if they have a better fit since they are currently $ 20 . 	Headphone
These light weight comfortable headphones really do sound great . . I would know because I am using them right now !! After switching from my 40 dollar koss ones I can immediately tell the difference . When using the HD 477 's you will hear new sounds in every song you listen to that your old older headphones could not bring out . Every sound is clear and that bass is better than expected in my opinion . The only little problem I have with these headphones is that if you leave them on too long they can tend to bother your ears a bit , but maybe thats just me . For an affordable price the HD 477 's are most deff worth it !! 	Headphone
this was a great idea to swim listening to music i am so glad i bought this 	Headphone
This headset had excellent quality of sound and the ability to adjust frequency to better clarify voices . It was very comfortable to wear , with little pressure on your ears . A wonderfull headset . 	Headphone
For something that is about half the price of every other set of Bluetooth stereo headphones out there , I was expecting something with a terrible build and limited functionality . These are pretty amazing , considering ! They are comfortable enough , they sound is great , the build is actually quite good , they seem pretty durable , and the case is surprisingly nice and well built as well . I use these primarily for listening to music on my phone while running or doing yard work , and they have proven to make the whole experience much nicer . Answering a call while in use is a breeze , and the microphone is adequate for a clear phone call . The only strange little flaw is they tend to loose connectivity if I have my phone in my left pocket -LRB- on the opposite side of my body from the earphone with the receiver -RRB- , though all is well if it is in my right pocket . Highly recommended ! 	Headphone
My wife researched headphones for playing at the gym and while traveling . I bought a splitter so we could listen to the same source with her headphones and my Sony headphones . I could never hear the material as well as she could so I decided to get these . What took me so long ?? They work great . 	Headphone
I usually prefer the older over the head headphones but those are increasingly rare these days . These are my first behind the neck headphones and they are great . They are small and snug but in a good way . The best sound I have heard from sports headphones . The cord is small for having your mp3\/smartphone on your arm and an extension cord comes with the product to keep it at your side or in your pocket . The extension cord has a volume knob as well . The headphones are water resistant . You will definitely enjoy these headphones . 	Headphone
Just over a year ago I was wanting to purchase a home theater system for the family to enhance the enjoyment of watching movies . After looking around we discided to purchse RCA 's model RT-2300 Digital sound processor . After setting up the system we enjoyed many movies and the sound was wonderful . We even added a DVD player to further advance the enjoyment of watching movies . When the system was almost a year old , the nightmare started . On occasion the system would shut down by itsself and would not powerup again for several minutes . This seemed to only be a minor inconvience after all , it only happeded occasionally . -LRB- At first : -LCB- -RRB- Soon the system would not even power up for more that a few seconds and all movie watching stopped . I have taken the system in for repair three different times -LRB- for around $ 100 -RRB- and the system still does not work . The receiver has spent the last seven -LRB- 7 -RRB- months in and out of the repair shop and still no remedy has been found . ocording to the repairman , he called RCA for some technical help in finding the problem and they said they do not know anything about the reciever because they do not manufacture it directly . So I have a receiver that will sit around and collect dust until the next yard sale . I will most likely hold on to the speakers , after all one ca n't have too many book ends in the library . In short , BE CAREFUL when considering the RCA RT-2300 . 	Home Theater System
... cause I did n't believe it either . Quincy Jones + Studio Level speaker mfgr = quality I did n't expect at a value I could never get through normal channels . I 'm not an audiophile , but these create a better sound space than my local movie theater . I did n't plan to add surround sound to my flat-screen till I found these , but now I actually look forward to sitting down to the sound as much as the picture with my new flat screen . For the first few weeks , we turned around on several occassions thinking someone might be in the house , when we heard a particularly clear back noise . It was eerie . On the older silver line set that I own , lab analysis shows a nice , even sound across all bandwidths except for a narrow drop off just below the voice range . When I first bought these I thought I could hear that difference playing the same song back and forth with my home audio system . Now I do n't hear it , but I think I 've just gotten used to it . Of course my home audio system ca n't touch the clean simplicity of the highs on ribbon technology speakers . As a point of comparison , when I sit in the comfy leather chair at Best-Buy to watch their top of the line set up , the sound is a little bit richer and beefier than this set up will deliver . Still , these are n't toys themselves . At 110 pounds there 's a lot of mass in speaker magnets . When I come home to this I 'm very satisfied with this sound . It 's way beyond the cheese-factor of a typical home theater in a box , conveys movie sound tracks and football games well enough to entrance -LRB- too well - I 've gained 20 pounds -RRB- and the sense of things moving in space is believable and real . For me it 's clear enough that I 've saved hundreds on movies I now watch at home instead of in the theater . I think the way they can do this so cheaply is by not chasing the most recent audio format\/standard on the receiver . You 'll notice Dolby does n't say `` Dolby-HD . '' Note too that there 's no built disc player , etc. . Just sound stuff : a tuner and an amplifier . To my ears the quality of these speakers contributes a lot more than anything in the latest DTS or Dolby standard and , with good speakers , I ca n't tell the difference . If your ears can tell the difference delivered by the most recent standards you may want to upgrade the receiver at some point and keep the speakers , or you may be able to hear things I ca n't and need to be shopping in the 3-5k range . I love mine just as it is . They clearly have found an affordable way to harness ribbon technology too . I remember in the 80 's giant ribbon tech speakers were ultra high-end . Note too that there is no HDMI pass-through connection on the back . That may be a deal breaker for some , it works fine for me . I just connect the optical port out of my TV to the optical in on this receiver . So , for blu-ray discs my BD player connects directly to the TV with HDMI and the TV connects to this receiver via optical . Works for me . The lack of HDMI pass through is probably another way they managed to kept the cost this low . I had trouble believing you could get sound this good at this cost . If I had n't found the audio response data , I would have assumed the positive reviewers just did n't know sound . I took a risk and was well rewarded . I 'm no audiophile myself but my sense is I could get this quality , more connections , and maybe a little more volume if I were willing to spend about $ 2k on something else . Hope that helps .

Panasonic SC-HT900 . <p> My Rating : FRUSTRATING <p> I bought this unit new in the box from Circuit City for $ 479 in July 2003 . <p> The Good : Sleek design for a small cabinet volume . Speakers are unobtrusive , they do n't hog my living room . Holds 5 DVDs with Progressive Scan capability . <p> The Bad : 1 . If a DVD is playing , then when any other input is selected -LRB- such as TV to check sports scores , or FM -RRB- , the DVD player stops and returns to the main menu ! That 's right , it has no knowledge of where it was in the movie if you either mistakenly or intentionally change the input . <p> 2 . From the remote , it can be put into a mode where no sound comes out when playing a DVD even though the video portion appears on the TV . Selecting FM or turning the unit off then on will force it to output sound , but again , you 've lost your place in the movie . When in this silent mode , other buttons on the remote do not , by themselves , force audio output . Perhaps a sequence of button pushes will wake the amplifier up , but I do n't have the patience to try sequences . <p> 3 . The confusing remote has some buttons whose sole purpose is to control other components -LRB- if Panasonic provided codes for your particular units -RRB- . The AV System button can turn your TV on but it does n't select the TV input on the SC-HT900 . TV\/Video can change the video input on your TV , but it does n't select the TV input on the SC-HT900 . Several button functions are shifted . You have to HOLD DOWN the shift button while pressing another button . This is a three handed operation . One hand to hold the remote , one hand for pressing the shift button , and one hand for pressing the desired function . Good luck ! The buttons on the remote are discrete , whereas those on the receiver are toggles . The receiver has Disk Skip , on the remote you must press Disk then a number between 1 and 5 . The receiver has a Source Select button that toggles between the 7 inputs , the remote has 5 unshifted buttons and 1 shifted button for the same purpose . <p> 4 . The amplifier is too weak and fails at normal loudness levels . The volume function is calibrated in dB from -68 to 0 . At any level above -22 on my unit , the amplifier will eventually fail while watching a movie or listening to a CD . At -20 , this typically takes about 45 minutes before a loud POP is heard through all speakers followed by a severe decrease in volume . After a few seconds , the volume returns to normal . Several minutes later , another POP is heard , and the sequence repeats with the interval becoming shorter between POPs . I assume my unit is defective in this regard , but I have n't wanted to extract the unit from its cabinet to take it in for service . I play movies and CDs at settings -22 and below . <p> 5 . The optical digital input on my unit does n't work . No sound is output , although the front panel light is lit , indicating that the optical input is selected . This input 's sampling frequency for Dolby Digital is supposed to automatically switch between 32 , 44.1 , and 48 KHz rates . I 've tried connecting a few optical output devices with two new cables . My SC-HT900 does not output any sound when the optical input is selected . Two other surround systems in my home work fine when connected to the same components with the same cables . <p> Since it is still under warranty , I 'm taking it to a service center to get item 5 corrected if possible . Since it takes more than a half hour for the problem in item 4 to happen , I do n't have much hope of getting it fixed . Since the DVD player and receiver are in the same thin unit , and the amplifier is in the subwoofer enclosure , I have to take both units to the shop . If they are not repairable , I 'll have to get a new receiver and a new subwoofer . The subwoofer does not appear that it can be driven by an RCA jack or otherwise from a standard surround sound receiver . I wish I had considered the interrelationship and marriage of the DVD\/Receiver and the Subwoofer\/Amplifier when I bought it . 	Home Theater System
Bought this system 's equivalent from Onkyo about a year ago . Unless you are a true audiophile with hearing surpassing a cat 's -- and do n't kid yourself that you are -- then you will NOT tell the difference between this and a Bose system at three times the price . Or any other system , for that matter -LRB- yes , I know that Bose is not well regarded by cognoscenti despite their well crafted rep -RRB- . As long as Onkyo is willing to put this out for the price , then BUY it . Had my system professionally installed by a Circuit City contractor . Did an AMAZING job , know their stuff . Their home theater system ? From Onkyo . Maybe a bit higher on the specs scale , but still . 	Home Theater System
Update : Just paired up these speakers with the Onkyo HT-RC370 w \/ 4 Ohms settings and all I can say is WOW ! Now I can feel the true power of these speakers . Simply amazing ! I was getting this set for the satellite speakers . The sub that came with it is fine . The receiver does not have HDMI so I will definitely upgrade that . So far I have tried dvd , bluray , music cds , ps3 games -LRB- BTW , Killzone3 surround is crazy ! -RRB- , and karaoke -LRB- I have my own personal mini studio ... hehe -RRB- . THE SOUND IS SO CLEAR ! I will purchase the 7.1 system to have extra speakers just in case . Once these speakers run out , they are gone forever . SLS does not do home theater anymore . But I believe they still do concert halls . BTW , thank you AV-Express for the fast shipping ! Now I just want to re-watch all my favorite movies . I believe they are `` Hidden Gem '' speakers because you are getting concert hall , studio , etc. , quality speakers for small phenomenal cost . At least for an entry level home theater system , not sure what can beat this for the price . If you know another set of home theater system that is price similar to this which you think is high quality , please comment . Thanks in advance . 	Home Theater System
1st let me start by saying thank you amazon 4 the fast delivery of the Martin logan mlt-2 surround sound system . then me say i am and school audiophily from new york where back in the days street dj 's would bring there audio equipment out in the neighborhood and play at block parties and other events . i also spent time at different clubs looking and listing to the different turntables and speakers that were being used at that time . and they used great stuff , so i know good sound when i hear it . heart pounding bass , smooth midrange , and those ear tickling highs . i have owned some of the best mis price systems around . which bring me 2 the martin logan\/mlt -2 . currently i pump them with a pioneer vsx-921k , onkyo 5dics cd changer that is about 5yrs old and still works flawless , and 4 my tv and bluray i use 42 `` samsung lcd and samsung bluray player . 4 music i play anything from gospel 2 rock . and watch old worldwar2 movies to todays moveies like Transfomers . the mlt-2 's give u everything from rock solid bass with music and those super low booms u can only hear at the theater . the midrange and dialogue are smooth and clear , the highs are rich tinglely . they sounded better than the bose321 that i previously owned and the time i purcashed them they cost over a 1000.00 dollars . so 4 any body looking 4 great home theater speakers u do n't need 2 look any further than the Martin logan mlt-2 . great job martin logan .

My purchase of a nice sony 32inch Wega required the accompanyment of a nice surround system . The HT5100D has a bunch of wonderful aspects . First and foremost it has amazing DTS playback . With the optical cable hooked up -LRB- which is not included and ranges from about 40-80 dollars -RRB- this systems sounds crystal clear . It allows you to adjust to the imperfections of your living room or anywhere else you might put this system . For example ... this system allows you to choose the surround sound quality and the distance speakers are set from one another . This allows for an excellent listening advantage in any room . Another excellent thing is the CD\/DVD changer . Although I thought I would never need a DVD changer I was so wrong ... with the addition of almost 100s of DVDs it is imperitive that you have a changer . Another great thing is the visual aspect of this system . It is entirely gray ... which if you own a Wega like me matches perfectly ! <p> Now a few downsides ... The cd playback is a bit weak . In fact if your not running DTS the system in general is a bit weak . You need to seriously crank it to catch the key phrases . Something that I did not need to do with my old Harmon Kardon system ... -LRB- of course that system broke and was 100s more expensive ! -RRB- Another downside is the bass . A mere 50 watts pumping an un-impressive subwoofer . With such a nice high sounding system I expected a bit more in the low range . Of course subs are subs and you can always upgrade later , although currently Sony does not offer a great selection . <p> Overall this has been a great system . It is powerful and what 's more it is very price worthly ! You get a lot out of this system for a small price , even if it does eventually end up in a spare room somewhere it will always be reasonable . Enjoy , and remember to upgrade on the cables ... espcially the optical , it makes all the difference ! Happy Listening ! 	Home Theater System
The main unit had a slick , slim design . The speakers were solid looking . All the needed cables were included , and everything was color coded and labeled . Then I turned it on . <p> First , whenever power was applied , or mode -LRB- disc\/tuner\/aux -RRB- changed , a disturbingly loud `` klunk '' noise was made . The unit always powers up in disc mode , and will not respond for several seconds while it tries to load a disc . Settings -LRB- such as volume -RRB- are often lost or different when changing between modes . Many functions are not available in all modes . For example , `` Mute '' only works when playing a disc . The equalizer only applied to audio CDs . And so on . <p> I found I had to wait one or two seconds after pressing a button before the unit responded . If I pressed additional buttons before the unit was ready , it sometimes did not respond , or did the wrong thing . <p> Sometimes , while changing between modes -LRB- e.g. , from radio tuner to aux in -RRB- , the disc tray would eject an inch or so out of the unit , and then stop . This is especially ironic given that the eject button does not function unless you are in disc mode . <p> Audio and video artifacts -LRB- pops , clicks , on-screen flashes , etc. -RRB- occurred when navigating DVD menus . <p> Worst of all , the unit locked up several times playing DVDs . The picture would corrupt , then everything would just stop . I had to unplug the unit , and then plug it back in , to get it to respond again . This happened on several different DVDs , including a brand-new , just-opened disc . <p> I returned the unit to the store . I was not expecting much , but this model failed to meet even basic expectations . 	Home Theater System
Other reviews are right : It takes about 2 years before the DVD player malfunctions . Ours did last night , after purchasing it in Oct 2002 . We 're looking at significant repair costs . Awesome sound is N\/A if you ca n't enjoy the main function of the unit -LRB- video -RRB- . 	Home Theater System
I was super excited to give this as a gift for christmas . Unfortunately our system sounds like angry chipmunks when its turned on ... we 've tried SEVERAL changes in settings and to no avail . I 'm overly dissapointed especially after doing weeks of research on several systems and finally choosing this one . Never again ! not to mention that it arrived in a marked box and was delivered to the person whom the gift was for ! SHAME on you AMAZON !! FYI I purchased all the other compatable cables etc , our TV is a Visio itself and it still sounds terrible . 	Home Theater System
I live in a one bedroom apartment and this system is as powerful as I 'll ever need . I gambled on it because of the price , figuring it would probably suck , but hoping it would at least be a little better than my TV sound . I was wrong . It does n't suck at all . It 's actually pretty awesome . In fact it sounds almost as good as my ex-roommate 's surround system which cost a couple hundred dollars more . I was a little worried when I opened the box and saw how tiny all the speakers were , but they produce very big sound for their size . Anyone who wants thundering bass that will rattle the walls should definitely look elsewhere but if you are living in an apartment , this unit should be more than sufficient for your needs . It sounds absolutely great for what it is - a budget priced surround system . I do n't understand the people who have mentioned needing to augment these speakers with their TV sound . I think that they must have the speakers hooked up wrong or have the individual channels -LRB- front , center , sub-woofer and rear -RRB- turned down , so the master volume is n't giving them what they need . I can only turn the volume up about half-way before I start to worry about my neighbors , so I 'm clearly getting something different out of my set-up . I do n't think I 'm just being overly courteous either - at full volume , with the doors closed , the system can be heard fairly easily from the courtyard\/hallway outside of my apartment . With the standard settings , the rear channel is a little quiet for my taste , but since there is individual control for the different channels , it is very easy to adjust . The biggest problem with the system is that there are only two composite inputs and one front facing `` line-in '' portable audio input . That means no HDMI , component or IR inputs and if you want to hook up more than two devices , you 're going to need a separate switcher . The higher end inputs are not a big deal for me . I have already stated that I live in an apartment and must be courteous with my volume . HDMI , component , or IR would allow for much better fidelity with a system that really cranks , but with my personal needs in mind , the two composite inputs are just fine . Besides , how much do you expect for $ 56 ? In summary ; This system is amazing for the price . Perfect for apartments , dens , etc. . There are some limitations and it may not be the right system for you if you are living in a big house , but it definitely exceeded what I expected to get from it . + Price . Ca n't be beat . + Compact size - perfect for an apartment + Good sound and pretty loud for such a compact system - again , perfect for small to mid-sized apartments . + Remote with individual channel controls . This is very handy and not available in the other units I saw in this price range . + Audio device port is a nice bonus - Bass is less than thunderous - Limited inputs - Probably not appropriate for large rooms in large houses 	Home Theater System
This is exactly what i wanted . Though it is not large , the sound is great and the wireless woofer with side speakers leaves my room uncluttered . I am very pleased and would highly recommend to others . I also like the remote being small and simple with adjustment buttons hidden . 	Home Theater System
I love my sls speakers . Makes my home theater experience phenominal . The subwoofer is the size of a small cabinet . Everything is crisp and clear . I worked with sls speakers in the past and love em . Highs mids and lows are very nice . Considering how much I paid , I could have bought systems 3 times as much and wouldnt have been half as nice . Its a steal get it . 	Home Theater System
I have these speakers and think they sound great ! I would n't have paid $ 2500 + originally but they deliver a clear sound , look great , and do n't take up much room at all . 	Home Theater System
This system had an easy set up it only took me about 10 minutes , maybe less . The length of the speaker wires were just right for my studio and put out good sound . One draw back was the cords , each had one black side and then a different color running through the whole wire . It would n't have been so bad if only the first inch of so of the wires were such but now it made the wires pretty obvious if there was n't a way to place them discreetly . Overall a great product , but had one serious down fall for me and that was the blu-ray player . It took a while to load and then it would occasionally drop the sound for a quick second . Not noticible at first but happened more frequently . Then finally no sound at all . The blu-ray would freeze trying to load a DVD and then it was blinking pink and the home screen which lead to a solid pink screen . The AUX source worked fine and put out great sound still , so it was solely the blu-ray player that was problematic . So , if all you need is great sound from your AUX source this is a great buy . But since I know we want the whole system I would n't recommend this product . The return for me was super simple . Repack the system in the box it came in , print the UPS label from Return Center , place the return paper in box , and drop off at a UPS location . Got to the Returns Center in a week and reimbursement notice in the same day . 	Home Theater System
Overall this is a good sound system for the price . The rear speaker wires are definitely not long enough , you will have to buy longer ones . We have a small apartment and still the wires do not even come close to reaching unless they are stretched across the middle of the room . That 's pretty much my only complaint . 	Home Theater System
I was looking for a Home Theater in a box solution that is minimalist in appearance , without compromising on sound quality or available features . I tried the Bose 3-2-1 system and Cinemate speakers prior to this . I ended up returning both the products . For about $ 500 less , Yamaha delivers amazing sound quality in a very small footprint ! I highly recommend this product for apartment dwellers or someone who appreciates minimalism . PROS : - 3 HDMI Inputs + 1 Analog - Solid Build Quality + Yamaha reputation - One-of-a-kind receiver that has a built-in subwoofer - Great price & fast shipping on amazon.com CONS : - The speaker bar sometimes blocks the infrared port on the TV , thereby making it difficult to use the TV remote . -LRB- This is really not a con , as you can dismount the legs to lower the height or position the speaker appropriately -RRB- 	Home Theater System
I bought this system for my bedroom theater . Because I am disabled , I wanted to have something that was not going to be too complicated and wanted a system from one manufacturer . I heard this system at a Radio Shack and even in the showroom environment it sounded very good . After installing it my bedroom , it sounds great . A better sub would be nice but that is immaterial as the bass from this system once you find a corner to place the sub is very good . The remote has no problem controlling all the RCA equipment that is attached to the receiver . The biggest nit I have is that the the receiver does not upconvert the video to the monitor so you need to have a monitor that has both s-video and composite inputs . 	Home Theater System
System worked great right out of the box . It has many features that I did not expect for the price . I use this system as an upgrade in my motorhome . 	Home Theater System
I just purchased this a week ago . So far , so good ... the unit works well and sounds good , the only real complaint is the lack of bass from the subwoofer . It is only a 61\/4 '' subwoofer , so I knew the bass would n't be extremely good , but I was hoping for a little more . The satelite speakers work and sound great . Good clear output from them . Overall , a pretty decent product for the money . 	Home Theater System
I bought this system last year . I had kept it in the box for about 2 months because I was planning a move and did not want to hook it up . I hooked it up in Nov or Dec of last year and played two DVDs . Had problems with both on audio and had to adjust language to either 2.0 or 5.1 before it would play right . Most recently I joined a DVD club , bought many DVDs and have problems playing any DVD that does not have language choice of 5.1 or 2.0 . Called manufacturer and they said too bad , it 's out of warranty . What a waste of money . DO N'T BUY THIS PRODUCT . 	Home Theater System
The Toshiba SD-43HTSU and at least one other Toshiba system has a high failure rate . The unit comes on , displays `` Hello ... Protection ... Goodbye '' and shuts off . Search of the web and a call to Toshiba both blame the problem on C27 . For those not electronically minded , that is a Capacitor number 27 . This particular capacitor is a 100uF -LRB- microfarad -RRB- with a voltage rating of 16V . I have replaced C27 with a 100uF rated at 25V on the theory that excess voltage was the problem . So far so good . The unit works again ! To replace this capacitor -LRB- which costs less than a dollar at an electronics supply store -RRB- , first remove the top cover . C27 is labeled in small print on the main board -LRB- biggest and below all other boards -RRB- near the center of the instrument . You will have to remove the bottom board entirely , which looks complicated but is not really too bad . To get at the main board , and unsolder C27 , you have to remove the main board . Do not worry about getting the connectors back where they came from . They are all keyed so that they go in only one way and the semi-permanent bend in the wires makes it pretty obvious where all the connectors go and which way . In the way is a vertical board which runs from front to back . This vertical board is also attached permanently to a 3 '' X 5 '' board attached to the rear panel via the video input and output connectors . Both boards come out together if you unfasten the 3 '' X 4 '' board from the rear panel . The vertical board makes connection to the main board in two places with edge connectors on the vertical board . Note how they fit into the main board . Remove every screw from the rear panel except those holding the fan and those holding the antenna connectors to the rear panel . Carefully pull out the two flat cables from the center vertical board and one between the AM\/FM tuner -LRB- small board in the left rear corner of instrument -RRB- to the 3 '' X 5 '' board . One connector with individual wires connects to the DVD assembly . It is soldered to the main board , but the connector comes out easily at the DVD assembly end . Pull the sides of the instrument apart very slightly to unsnap the rear panel from the instrument . One connector below the 3 '' X 5 '' board connects to the power supply board directly beneath the 3 '' X 5 '' board . My instrument has a toroid around that cable ... yours may not . Pull out all the connectors to the main board and remove the 6 screws holding it to the bottom of the chassis . Remove the one screw toward the front of the instrument holding the vertical board in place . Now you can tip the main board up and get to the back . Note that the capacitor has a minus sign on it . You must replace the old capacitor in the same orientation . The minus sign points to the left of the instrument . Unsolder C27 and replace with 100uF\/25V . Be sure you have connected all the cables up again when you reassemble the unit . The whole job should take less than an hour and it sure beats the price of the repair or shipment to Toshiba . I am visiting in Panama at the moment and Toshiba has no repair and no warranty here . 	Home Theater System

I purchased the upgraded model that includes a Philips DVD -LRB- separate unit -RRB- , all other equipment is the same . The power and quality is spectacular .

I have had this product for a year . It works excellent , sounds great , much better than the HDTV speakers . Setup is a snap . Only one issue , but that was resolved quickly with a tech support call -LRB- a HDMI cable issue - not the LHB335 -RRB- . Be sure to use HDMI and\/or fiber optic cables in order to ensure great sound quality -LRB- those `` coax '' cables have gone the way of `` rabbit ears '' -RRB- . Please note that HDMI cables are notoriously fussy ... I had to gently , and the key word here is gently , wiggle it -LRB- the HDMI cable end -RRB- a little bit to get a good connection . I put in a DVD and watched for output . I tried three brands of HDMI cable before I found one that was reliable -LRB- price was NOT a good indicator of cable quality , either -RRB- . Now I have an RJ-45 cable to my internet modem , HDMI output to an HDTV , fiber optic input from two HDTV 's , and HDMI input from my notebook PC -LRB- it is permanently sitting on my entertainment center -RRB- . This setup gives me excellent MP3 playback from my PC -LRB- or directly from a USB drive into the LHB335 -RRB- , great HDTV sound , and streaming HD video from N \* tFl \* x. The bass sounds great when you turn up the volume , but your neighbors may not appreciate the sound as much as you do -LRB- mine do n't -RRB- . I play all types of music : pop , classic , jazz , rap , trance , hard rock , and they all sound great through this system . The sound is better than most actual movie theaters . The Blu-Ray picture quality is wonderful , and DVD picture quality is very good , too . I love that the built-in streaming video providers are already setup and ready to play . The remote control is intuitive , easy to use , and is easy on batteries - with quality replacement batteries -LRB- I would only move the `` Home '' button to some place other than just under the `` Sound Effect '' button -RRB- . Overall , I am very happy and quite satisfied with my purchase . If I were to have the issues that other reviewers have mentioned , I would take the unit back to the vendor for an exchange -LRB- Do n't pay the money that LG wants for a return , duh , when you can get a direct exchange for free -RRB- .

We have a small entertainment center and had been using an older stereo system to boost up the volume for our flat screen because it 's pretty quiet like most TVs that style . We wanted some more bass , but nothing over the top . After hooking this up , the sound is OK . The extra bass is nice , and during louder parts it sounds great , but does n't do well with dialogue\/quieter parts . It 's basically just a step up from the stereo system we had going before . It does n't have an AUX input either , which is kind of annoying . 	Home Theater System
If your goal is to get good sound for your home theater without dropping big bucks , take a look at this unit . Granted , a subwoofer of this size with only 50 watts can not compete with a big system , but if you want deep bass , be prepared to pay a whole lot more . It sounded to me like this system put out a decent level and taughtness of bass down to about 50 Hz and could play fairly dynamically up to 90 or 95 dB . Above that level , the system sounded compressed and the smoothness of the midrange went away . But at a reasonable volume level , the mids are well reproduced and smooth . The controls have adequate sensitivity to allow you to set equalization and surround effects to match your taste for a wide variety of movie soundtracks . This is a bargain . 	Home Theater System
This is overall a very nice compact audio system . It is stylish with metal finishing on the front and the speakers have better finishing than Panasonic 's SC-19 -LRB- ? -RRB- 5 cd changers at WalMart . It also plays DVD discs and the speakers are magnetic-shielded , which is another advantage when you connect it with a laptop to play mp3 's . The price of $ 150 -LRB- I do n't know why it went up like $ 200 after I purchased it -RRB- is pretty nice considering all these features . However , there are some minor things you need to consider before buying this unit . I usually listen to Jazz and classics and the bass is rather strong . The overall sound is not very clear like other hi-fi units , but you may not expect it from a $ 150 unit ... Also , you can not random-play mp3 files . However , this problem is the same for other Panasonic compact systems . This is rather silly . I hope Panasonic can improve it for their next models . Although this unit can read DVD-R discs , it does not support mp3 playbacks on a DVD-R disc . Overall , this is a fine unit . I wish it could play clear sounds as well as my cheap $ 50 Sennheiser PX100 headphone , but it is also true that I can not get a stereo unit like this with DVD support for $ 150 . I was thinking about JVC and Phillips units as well , but they were falling behind in overall features . 	Home Theater System
I was looking at this product in stores , and if you did n't know you can stick a speaker cable in the intenna slot to use it as an intenna . when i was checking it out . . i also noticed nothing came out of the rear speakers ... then i noticed that you can adjust the & amp ; quot ; distance & amp ; quot ; you are from the speaker . . this allows the system to adjust the volume accordingly . . so if the front are 5 feet away and the back are 10 feet away , but the center and sub are 2 feet away , you will still hear SURROUND ... its really cool , and i ca n't wait to buy them . . I have just over 200 and i need the differance . . I do n't live in an apartment , and im not some punk ruch kid , but i do have to save my allowance to buy anything ... and i ca n't wait to play Battlefield and hear the Airplanes fly overhead and im shooting the flak with the pouning shells from the subwoofer 	Home Theater System
I bought this as a gift , and believe me when I say it was a terrible disappointment when I set it up and found that the sound coming out of the center and surround channels -LRB- but not the front channels -RRB- was completely mangled by the receiver . I tried everything , but no matter what , CDs played in Pro Logic and Dolby Digitial encoded DVDs sounded awful . Strangely , if I played CDs or DVDs in stereo , it sounded great , so I believe there was something wrong with the surround channel amplifiers . 	Home Theater System
Excellent system ... powerful ... enough inputs and outputs -LRB- including HDMI -RRB- ... works very well with Samsung Plasma TV ... ordered with wireless rear speaker module ... I highly recommend it and would purchase it again !! 	Home Theater System
I found this product by googling blu-ray home theater . This model was listed at 149.97 from Sears in Ohio . Looking at the retail and what others are selling this unit at I jumped on this deal . The unit was a floor room model . I know that sounds bad already , but the unit had never been plugged in or ever turned on . It was just sitting there to make the tv they were trying to sell look good . The other down side about this floor room model is that they no longer had the remote or the owners manual . With that said I knew what I was getting into . I had read many reviews of this product . Some great , some good , and some who had good things to say about the unit a speakers themselves , but had all pointed out the same issue . That issue being that there was a whistling noise , like that of a tea kettle coming from one of the speakers . Granted I did buy the floor model , but it was in pristine condition . I plugged it in upon arriving at home and immediately noticed the same thing . There was a faint whistling noise coming from one of the speakers . I put my ear up to the speaker to make sure I was n't hearing things and sure enough it was there . The noise was faint and when the volume was turned up on whatever was being watched it was gone . If you are someone who this kind of thing would n't bother then these speakers are for you . For me , even though I paid way less than retail , when I pay a lot of money for a product , I want it to be near flawless , especially for a name like LG . I contacted their customer service and they recommended some quick fixes all of which did not work . He then told me I could have it sent in for repairs for a service charge of 69.00 . Upon being told that I quickly made the decision to take these speakers back . I understand what I bought was n't `` new '' , but the issue was of one that had been brought up by many people already . In my opinion Samsung makes excellent home theater for a decent price . My advise , to spend a little more to buy better quality product . In no way does spending more get you a better product , generally speaking , but if you are someone who spends the money on something , you want it to run well and have it be a product you can say , `` I 'm really happy about this product '' . You do n't need it to be perfect , but you do want to be a satisfied customer and appreciate the hard earned money you spent . 	Home Theater System
this Home theater system is horrible . It produces a small band at the top of the picture that is blue in color and affects every scene . Furthermore , when you power the unit down , then go back to the DVD that is already loaded , the unit plays from the beginning and not from where you last left off from . <p> Do n't waste your money . Stick with the Sony Dream System line . 	Home Theater System
My wife and I picked this one out after looking and listening to a lot of comparables . The sound has a fullness and depth that I just did n't hear in any other compact home theater system under $ 500 . Hookup took less time than I expected ; however , you will need to purchase additional speaker wire ... the supplied wires are just too short . -LRB- you do NOT necessarily need to buy Monster cable -RRB- The plus side of the sound quality outweighs the negative of a rather slow disc changer\/reader . And watching a DVD in Dolby ProLogicII is an excellent experience . The SACD format is also fantastic whether you 're listening to Dark Side of the Moon -LRB- an absolute must with SACD -RRB- or the Cleveland Symphony Orchestra -LRB- try Mahler 's Resurrection Symphony -RRB- . Again , it 's a perfect home theater system for the price . 	Home Theater System
I bought this for a small 1BR apartment and it is everything I could ask for and more . I spent a long time comparing Home Theatre Systems and chose this one because it had the most features at a reasonable price point . I have a Sony Bravia 32 '' that connects to the stereo system and that makes it very easy to control volume and power on\/off the system and tv together using the original TV\/Cable remotes . The three HDMI ports are great for CABLE , PS3 , and an extra port to connect my laptop , and when the system is off the pass-through option allows you to continue using your TV as if the system wasnt connected . The speakers and sub woofer sound great and I love the auto-calibration mic , it makes everything very simple . There is more than enough wire for front and rear speakers , the center speaker cord is a little small , and the gauge is just the right size to be hidden from sight under carpets and around walls . The HTS-S370 was a great buy and makes playing video games and watching TV and Movies more enjoyable . Pros : Great sound , Lots of wires , easy setup Cons : None ! Notes : I am not too sure why , but I use LCPM on PS3 and still my video games play in 720p not 1080p 	Home Theater System
Worked ok for 21\/2 months then ... nothing . no seperate ff\/rw button , too few inputs ... very few outputs ... poor rear speaker volume ... disappointing ! open and closing drawers problematic . I have a 15 year-old JVC 4.0 that works fine ... this p.o.s. went back to the factory . 	Home Theater System
I bought this piece as `` Used & New '' for $ $ ... I was expecting a system with some missing or damaged components . But I felt it was a good deal even if the Player was working . So went ahead and bought this system . This was shipped earlier than expected . When I opened the box to my surprise the box was packet perfectly with all the items brand new . Opened it and assembled it within 10 minutes . It was very easy as wires and sockets were color coded . The sound is great , just like watching a movie in a theater . The inbuilt onscreen MP3 player resembles Winamp and is great . <p> Totally the system can match any high end Hometheatre system . Do n't think twice looking at the cheap price . Its a excellent piece and you 'll really be happy after buying it . 	Home Theater System
The head unit is a bit slow - could use more processing power . And my PS3 is a better BluRay player at the end of day . 	Home Theater System
Easy setup Love the Pandora and streaming Netflix Bluray is incredible Highly recommend 	Home Theater System
This is truly an excellent buy . The receiver\/DVD player is n't very stylish , but the speakers produce clear and rich sound , and only distorts when it is turned all the way up . There is no need to run it all the way up though because the system is suprisingly powerful . The menu has a nice individual speaker setup list , so you can optimize each speaker . One word of caution though : DO NOT buy this if you intend to play just DVDs\/CDs on it ! The player reads disks with great difficulty and only works 7 out of 10 times . I recommend you hook up a better DVD player to the system as a receiver , and use it just for the speakers . 	Home Theater System
I love this stereo . I was looking for a small powerful stereo with a CD changer and the ability to connect an auxilliary audio source -LRB- XM MyFi -RRB- . The speakers had to be small enough to fit on my desktop and not look silly . I went to Best Buy and compared what they had in stock , and settled on this one , simply because it met all of my criteria , plus the speakers have 3 separate drivers - 4 '' woofer , 2-3\/8 '' mid , 1 '' ceramic tweeter . Also , it can play virtually every format of music , which is great because I download tons of songs and I hate having to convert them to . wav files from . mp3 . Also , it can play DVD-Audio and HDCD discs , both of which I have many of . Plus , it can play DVD-Videos , and it has component video outs , which I find amazing on such a small multi-tasking unit . I will probably never hook it up to a TV , but if I do , it 's nice to know that I have that option . I managed to get it for $ 249.99 , which according to some of the reviews I have read , is a steal at Best Buy . Setup was a breeze - everything was color-coded - and I was up and running in about 5 minutes . The speakers fit perfectly on the desktop , and actually the wood veneer comes pretty close to matching the color of my desk . The main unit managed to fit into one of the cabinets in my desk , so all you see are the speakers . I was quite surprised at how good it sounded . The highs were exceptionally clear , which the 1 '' tweeter has alot to do with , and the bass was powerful and rich , which is amazing for 4 '' drivers . I listen to a wide variety of music , from country to metal to techno to clasical , and everything in between , and I have spent the better part of 2 weeks playing around with different CDs to see if I could find a flaw in the sound . I still have n't . I think the techno\/trance music is an especially good test for the speakers , because there is so much going on and all three drivers are being tested . So far , it sounds amazing . The amp has yet to fade out at all with extended bass lines or extremely hard bass hits . I have seen a few negative comments on the bass output . I just do n't get where those comments are coming from . They must be people who like bass-heavy music and not true-sounding music . From my perspective , the music sounds just the way it was intended to sound . However , if you are a bass-nut , the unit offers a sub pre-out , which is simply amazing on such a small unit . I do n't think an external sub is needed at all , but maybe somebody does . Now , I said in the title that you must buy it for what it 's intended . What I mean is that you should NOT buy this as a main home theater receiver . You will be very disappointed . I have a THX Ultra2 Certified Onkyo and very high-end speakers for that purpose , and I would never recommend anything less . However , if you are like me , and looking for a desktop or shelf system that sounds great and maintains a small size , then this is perfect . Also , I can see how I would have loved to have this when I first went to college . Small size , powerful sound , the ability to be a DVD player , all at a relatively cheap price . Perfect for any dorm room . I remember there were people who had Aiwa shelf systems that were twice as expensive and twice and large that produced half the sound quality , and they still had to have a separate DVD player . I recommend this to anybody whose needs match the criteria I 've laid out . I could n't be happier . If you want a home theater system , do yourself a favor and buy the best receiver and speaker combo you can afford , not a mini shelf system . 	Home Theater System
I just wanted to make the point that for $ 300 - $ 350 you can get the SC-HT820 \/ HT830\/HT833 system , which despite the lower number is arguably better . The 820\/830 system has AM\/FM , fully controlled from the remote , 5-disc changer , and a mid-high end VCR with high-speed transport , and very good speakers and sound -LRB- does just great in our 15x30 living room . -RRB- This model sacrifices AM\/FM\/VCR for a little more stylishness , but imho its not a better system .

My current rig as of 1\/2011 : - Fluance SXHTB + - JBL ES250PBK 400-Watt High-Powered 12-Inch Subwoofer - Harman Kardon AVR 2600 Receiver - PlayStation 3 using 1.4 a HDMI cables from Amazon on Linear PCM settings -LRB- not MonsterRipOffs -RRB- I went from Infinity TSS-750 series satellite speakers to these Fluance speakers , and I have to say , they 're simply amazing . I ca n't really compare to any other bookshelf speakers , only satellite speakers . However , I have heard speakers like these in the store and frankly , I could n't tell you the difference between these and Polk audio . As for shipping , Fluance is a smaller company and you can only buy the speakers from them , so I was expecting a long wait time . Shipping from Canada -LRB- I assume , since they 're based there -RRB- , my speakers were there by the end of the week after ordering on a Monday . I considered that to be speedy delivery . Before ordering though , I did have to wait for several months because they were out of stock , but I was n't ready to buy then anyway . What 's included are two bookshelf speakers , a center , and two rear\/sides -LRB- whichever you prefer -RRB- . On Fluance 's website , you can order two more speakers for complete 7.1 audio for $ 39.99 a speaker . The picture does n't do them justice . I was going to actually paint the speakers black , as I hate `` wood '' looking furniture , but these are a bit darker than the picture advertises them to be . They actually blend pretty well with darker furniture . This comes from my wife as well , who did n't want to buy these just because she hates the wood look . But she instantly liked the darker color they arrived in . Setting these suckers up was a little new to me . Again , I never had bookshelf speakers before , so I did n't know I needed to have two wires per speaker , but I guess I should have figured that out . After I got them setup , my receiver did all the work as far as configuring them , with me tweaking them a bit . Now , I bought the subwoofer mentioned above at the exact same time . That sucker is huge , and packs a nice punch . But after the first day , I turned it off so I could play games at night , and really , I have n't used the subwoofer hardly since . My Blu-rays and games manage to boom at the appropriate moments , without the subwoofer . Often times , I felt like I was using my old subwoofer for bass , just from the speakers . They 're not going to rattle windows , and tear down the roof , but they 're great if you do n't want to be too loud because of neighbors\/sleeping wife . The price , the quality , and the look is perfect . If someone broke in my house and robbed me blind , I would n't think twice about buying these again . At $ 299 -LRB- plus about $ 80 shipping -RRB- , these really feel like a steal . Everyone that has heard them has been greatly impressed , and I feel if you 're planning on getting a Polk audio set , consider Fluance as a superior product than them since they sound the exact same and cost way less .

No hassle to set up . . great sound for a small 2 bed apartment living room ... Perfect . . one can enjoy surround system without complaint from neighbors ... I recommend for a small house\/room ... It is OK to have just the DVD as I already have a PS3 ... looking for blu ray aswell go for other stuff 	Home Theater System
The HT-SK5 is a lemon -- do n't buy it . Although the sound quality is great , the audio does n't match the video when you 're using a digital input , like digital HDTV . So , the lips do n't match the words on any digital stations . It made it impossible to watch any HDTV programming , which essentially was why I bought it . <p> After 3 months of dealing with Samsung 's poor technical support , including shipping the product back to Samsung , I learned from Samsung that they ca n't fix the problem , and they do n't have a replacement product that would work better . The only thing more frustrating than the audio sync problem was Samsung 's awful technical support . The staff was poorly educated about their own products , they never returned calls or e-mail like they promised , and seemed to have no concern for their customers . Do n't waste your money -- in fact , Samsung treated me so poorly , I ca n't recommend buying any Samsung products . 	Home Theater System
I purchased this unit and have been very surprised at the sound quality it provides . If you set this unit up for the room it performs like a much more expensive unit . The bass is good , rear support is good , and the volume of the center front channel is also adjustable . 	Home Theater System
I purchased this product , along with a Samsung 55 '' LCD TV and Logitech Harmony One . I LOVE IT !! Samsung is making amazing products with great price points . Because I went from a 27 '' tube TV with no SS , I am still in shock from the amazing picture and sound my new set up is putting out . One recommendation I would make is to purchase a Logitech remote also . Going from 4 remote controlls to 1 is amazingly easy and reduces clutter . I am by no means electronically knowledgable but was able to set up the TV , surround sound system and remote in about 3 hours ! My only complaint is the Blu-ray player does not always `` tune '' to the right setting when going from `` watch DVD '' to `` watch cable '' . This is easily fixed by going through the help menu on the Logitech -LRB- takes about 5 button pushes -RRB- . Overall , I am completely satisfied with what Samsung has provided , customer service was so helpful and being able to trouble shoot via internet chat is very nice , no holding on the phone !

It seems sad that I would pine over a 2 speaker DVD\/CD system but truth be told the Panasonic SC-DP1 did it all right in one small little package that only cost me $ 200 bucks back in the day . I loved that little thing . It had decent sound and it played DVD 's and music and it had a radio . I was so happy with it , but then I had to give it up to my ex , it was either that or I lose my Bose 3-2-1 and that was n't going to happen . If you can ever find one of these , buy it . It 's a steal if its under $ 200 . You will be pleased . More so because it has Component connections and because you can hook an active subwooder up to this baby and you have an instant pseudo-surround sound home theater system with an easy to use remote and great crisp sound for small rooms . One day , I will be re-united with another Panasonic SC-DP1 . I hope one day soon as I am missing it dearly . 	Home Theater System
There are plenty of good reviews here , so I would only add that this Onkyo is more than powerful for BIG rooms . I have it on a 17x34 feet -LRB- 5x10 meters -RRB- room , and it sounds perfectly , so , unless you are some kind of king , it should be enough . 	Home Theater System

I purchased a Samsung HT-DM150 Home Theater System to complement the Samsung 27 '' HDTV I had gotten for my bedroom sitting area . It 's a great compact system for a compact room . I would n't recommend using it in a large room , but it certainly provides enough power for a small room . The manual is adequate , but could provide a little more detail . Connecting and configuring the system was straightforward and very easy to do . Once everything was up and running , I proceeded to test the system out . The picture quality through the component cables was exceptional and the sound was clean with little perceptible distortion . The system easily handled the various DVDs I threw at it and was able to provide volume levels a lot higher than I expected . The remote control leaves something to be desired , but most OEM remotes do . Still , the machine was everything I had wanted and I did n't have to shell out a lot of cash to get it so I was very happy and very imporessed with Samsung . Unfortunately , my enjoyment of the system did n't last long . Apparently , the unit runs extremely hot and the fan may not provide enough cooling . Around 1.5-2 hours into watching DVDs , the system refused to display a picture on the screen . The unit was very hot and the fan apeared to have stopped . Only after I turned the power off and then turned it on again , did I receive a picture . I had read about this issue when researching the product , but thought it might have been corrected . Guess I was wrong . The unit I have is not enclosed in a cabinet , but lies on an open shelf exposed on all four sides , so it is not an issue of improper ventillation . I plan to take a look at the fan and see if there is some way I can fix it myself before returning it to the store for a replacement or store credit . I hope there is a solution , because frankly , I 'd hate to have to shell out more cash for a system that does half of what this one does . To sum it all up , for the price , the features ca n't be beat . Just be aware the unit does run rather hot and you may have some issues with the unit not working . If Samsung addresses these problems , they 'll have a killer system . So 2 stars because of the low power and poor reliability as a result of cooling . If not for the cooling issue , I 'd give the Samsung HT-DM150 at least 4 stars . 	Home Theater System
What a piece of junk ! After having this system for about 9 months , I noticed that the speakers started to make a loud snap , followed by loud crackling noises , and then would produce absolutely no sound for a few seconds . The snap would scare the daylights out of us as it was extremely loud and totally random . We have had it in for service TWICE by the Panasonic-authorized dealer that Panasonic referred us to . The second time we were told that the parts were on backorder from Panasonic . That was almost 2 months ago . So , our system has been sitting at the shop for 2 months . AVOID THIS SYSTEM AT ALL COSTS !!! It has been nothing but a hassle and repair from the Panasonic-authorized dealer has been a nightmare . Frankly , I ca n't believe that people would pay over $ 50 for a system with KNOWN problems , as clearly evidenced by all of the other reviewers that have had the same exact problem . I guess Panasonic is to cheap to put out a recall . 	Home Theater System
Sony 's Bravia line has yet to disappoint me . This home theater in a box is a really nice setup . It does n't have the flexibility of a high-end receiver like a Denon or Onkyo , but that 's not really what a home theater in a box setup is supposed to do . It has one HDMI output , but no HDMI inputs , and only one optical input . If you 've got a newer model tv , that 's all you need most of the time . If you can run all of your HDMI sources into your tv , you can just run the one optical cable to this receiver and you 're ready to go . It 's plenty powerful for most living rooms and gets loud without losing much resolution . The subwoofer the weakest aspect of this set , but it 's not that bad . You can turn it up in the settings if you want a little more bottom end . I take it back , the weakest aspect of this set is the proprietary input system for the speaker wires . Sony is n't the only company to do this , so it 's hard to single them out here , but it 's still annoying . I prefer to use lower gauge speaker wires , but the proprietary speaker plugs make that almost impossible . Overall , I prefer this setup to most component systems because A -RRB- it does n't take up much space B -RRB- it reproduces sounds evenly and accurately C -RRB- the DVD upconversion is pretty good and D -RRB- the price is very nice . I down-sized from a 7.1 component setup and do n't regret it for a second . 	Home Theater System
Well , I ended up buying mine on closeout from Radio Shack for $ 149 . . I love mine ... The sound really is great , and the price was AWESOME ! I use mine for DVD 's , my TV 's regular sound for all TV I watch , and also as a Tuner to listen to the radio \/ CD 's in surround sound . Some buyers talked about a whine from the speakers ... I do n't know if this helps or not , but I will share - I had extra wire bundled up from the speakers and I did NOT put all that wire anywhere near the speakers or the head unit . I thought that bundle of wire near a speaker might cause interference , so if you have that whine , make sure the extra wire is not near the equipment . Mine does not make any noise on standby , or skip at all either . I am very happy with mine . 	Home Theater System
Dolby , Sub Woofer and Surround make it stand out . Dubbing works great . I reccommend it . 	Home Theater System
apparently everyone else is having a hard time with theirs . I have had no trouble with mine at all . I have had it for 3 years ; bought it brand new . The complaints I have heard about the sound and quality of the bass and treble are just nitpicky . You have many sound fields to choose from , as well as night and day options for sound emphasis . Many controls are found on remote and can not be found on main unit , though . Without the remote you will be locked out of many features . The DTS option is fabulous . If you have DTS dvd 's you will love this sony product . I love my sound system , and many of my friends love the way it looks and sounds compared to theirs . 	Home Theater System
Very nice for small to medium sized living rooms ! My only complaint is the lack of any configuration settings other than subwoofers and volume level . You ca n't turn the subs off and the lowest setting is still pretty bumpin . I live in an apartment and do n't want to be too un-neighborly late at night . 	Home Theater System

PROS : - really nice entry level for the price . purchased at amazon -LRB- free shipping through J&R -RRB- delivered by UPS , no damages and box came heavily protected . - with purchased of new 16 gauge speaker wires I choose , sounds better . highs , mids , lows are enhanced . - great with hdmi connections . got hdmi 6 feet cable from amazon . hook up sat\/cable and ps3 only . with my LG 1080p 47 inch hdtv pictures great and after adjusting speaker channels and loudness . Sounds very loud . rocks my apartment -LRB- and in PS3 , sounds so vibrant is dolby 7.1 -RRB- , even satellite speakers are good . CONS : - with nintendo wii , ca n't connect video -LRB- or i just missed rca connection , might work with components cables -RRB- though not interested to diagnose since i just have PS3 in HDMI , which is awesome ! - could n't play my hand held video recorder up front -LRB- no easy access -RRB- have to go in the back to play your handheld . other than that , it 's a great buy for entry level reciever with 5.1 speakers . I was considering entry level sony , onkyo and yamaha but , i 'm glad I bought the denon . 	Home Theater System
After reading through all of the reviews , I decided to roll the dice and buy the Samsung HT-WP38 . There were a few write-ups where people were complaining about wires , hissing , skipping , even customer service ... well , I have n't seen any of these issues . I think a lot of issues about wireless devices can be attributed to people not understanding the technology . This device uses the 2.4 GHz band , the same band as a lot of cordless phones and wireless networking devices . Do your research , check your phones and WAPs , and replace anything that might interfere . I have a 5.8 GHz wireless router sitting right behind this reciever and there is NO interference , hissing , static , crackling . Sound is crystal clear . And yes , the wireless just keeps you from running wires from the front of the room to the back . The rear channels ARE wired to a reciever box , but it 's no big deal to put that out of sight . I think the pictures detail the setup well . Anyway , overall a great entry level HTS . 	Home Theater System
This is a steal at $ 199.00 . I purchased this system as a gift for my mom . This is an awesome system for someone who wants surround sound but does not want a sub woofer that is going to rattle the walls . I can not believe the clear and well balanced sound that comes out of the speakers . We hooked up a DVD player and Dish receiver to the system . If you use an optical cord , you do n't have to switch the receiver back and forth to the DVD player and Dish receiver . The switch is automatically done . All and all if your looking for a excellent system and do n't want to spend a lot of money , this is the one to get !! 	Home Theater System
Picked this up last week from Vanns through Amazon . Setup was a breeze . Sound quality is excellent . Minimum number of wires . Optical audio to fios box HDMI to TV and two set of speaker wires . Decent selection of free and premium internet audio and video apps . I am tempted to drop a few of my pay services and subscribe to 1 or two all you can eat download subscriptions . The only negative is that after I programmed my hatmony remote it still does n't automatically always go to the correct input . 	Home Theater System
This system has several design flaws . One is the remote control design - intermittent at best . Another is the tray design . It misaligns itself , and scrapes up the disks inside . Do not buy this product . Panasonic needs to go back to the drawing board on this one . This really should have 0 stars , but that was not an option . A waste of time here . 	Home Theater System
Sound quality is what I need for my situation . However the base is to much for me and I can not find a way to turn it down , I have it all the way down in the settings and no change . Speakers are good , easy to install would be perfect if i could turn the base down . 	Home Theater System
I never expected panasonic products to work just for 2 years . It broke down exactly in 2 years . The main carousel changer started malfunctioning . The DVD player used to get stuck ... Overall ... bad product ... bad investment , ... Dont buy it ! 	Home Theater System
This system certainly helped the sound of our TV . I wish I had gone with a bit higher wattage , but all-in-all this does the job . The only negative is that all of the volume levels reset to the default when you power-off to standby mode , so I have to leave the speakers on all the time or reset the volume each time I turn it on .

I bought this system recently after my Panasonic DVD Surround System broke . I was a little leary about this system since other reviewers have mentioned a hissing noise here on Amazon and other sites for that matter . But I could n't find anything like this value and decided I could just take it back if I did n't like it . Well , I love it ! The sound is great ! Subwoofer is awesome ! I do not hear a hissing noise at all . This sounds so much better than my Panasonic which broke and that I had paid $ 100 more for . 	Home Theater System
I 've had this great system for a year and a half . Yesterday the LEDs stopped working . This seemed to be a frequent complaint from owners of this unit . I chatted with a Vizio rep and he told me to remove the power cord from the wall outlet , hold down the power button on the bar for 30 seconds and power it back up . The LEDs now work !

I purchased this system about a year ago from CC . before buying this unit i was considering Sony , Panasonic and Samsung , but when i went to the store and listened to the sound that this unit could produce i was sold . i live in a Town House and i have this unit set up in my basement . i have to keep my sub into - ve because anything near `` 0 '' wakes up my neighbor . : -RRB- the system got strong base and clear sound . if you can still find this home theater system , i will say dont think just buy it .

Bought this system when it was `` Today 's Deal '' . So far , I have n't been the least bit disappointed . As many other reviewers pointed out , if you are looking for big sound for a big room this probably is n't your best bet . However , if you are looking to add some punch to your weak TV speakers in a smaller room this system is great . I did n't want wires running all over so a sound bar was my best option . I really like the fact that the sub is built into the controller . Overall , I am very satisfied . 	Home Theater System
Took 5 minutes to set up and for the price this system is outstanding , I was not sure I did the right thing when i clicked to buy but I am glad i did . RCA is a good value and now im thinking about a new TV and RCA has some nice cheap large models so I am now considering an RCA based on value and quality . GET THIS SYSTEM . ITS GREAT 	Home Theater System
I was cautious in purchasing these speakers . I read how the LEDs in the front stopped working . Others did n't say but the LEDs show the volume levels as well as what settings you have so they are rather important . I have had the speakers for a couple weeks and the LEDs still work . The sound is excellent . I am very pleased with this purchase so far . 	Home Theater System
Panasonic packs a lot of value and versatility into its SC-HT400K Home Theater System . The quality and features of this system make it worth every penny of the manufacturer 's suggested retail price and a genuine bargain at the discounted prices found at retailers . <p> Setup was reasonably straightforward , although the spacing of speaker terminals was tight even for small fingers . A built-in white noise generator made balancing the output of the speakers a snap . <p> Most of the half dozen sound fields that can be imposed on the output -- ranging from an intimate club venue to a stadium - while more pleasingly understated than others I have heard , will , I suspect , find little use by most listeners . One of those fields , however , is very effective and clever . The `` party '' mode allows the listener to walk about the room without perceiving the source of sound to shift from speaker to speaker . <p> The sound from the speakers is unforced and transparent-at least at levels that the dogs and the neighbors will tolerate . The rear speakers do not make themselves obvious as a source of sound -LRB- except when the source material deliberately places the sound at those speakers -RRB- . The general effect of the rear speakers is subtly to pull sound from the plane of the front speakers into three dimensions . <p> Last year the leading consumer magazine rated Panasonic 's stand alone receiver , SA-HE100K , a best buy . A comparison of the SC-HT400K 's receiver with the SA-HE100K receiver done on Panasonic 's website shows the two receivers to be substantially the same , with the SC-HT400K lacking a few features that its brother has . -LRB- For example , the SA-HE100K is a 6.1 channel receiver ; it has an output for a rear center speaker . -RRB- If the price difference between the SA-HE100K plus a set of speakers and the SC-HT400K package narrows enough , the purchaser might want to consider buying the former separates rather than the latter system . <p> After the foregoing kudos , why give the SC-HT400K a rating of only four stars ? The subwoofer that I got with this system was defective . Fortunately , there is an authorized Panasonic repair shop within ten miles of my house and the defective part was replaced in a week at no charge under the manufacturer 's warranty . Nevertheless , the defect was an inconvenience and should not have gotten past quality control . 	Home Theater System
I needed to replace my older Sony stuff that had served me well . The price was right , the sound is right . Lots of choices in the set up , spent some time reading , adjusting , a bit of swearing but it serves its purpose well . My biggest oversight is the common lack of an analog input for phone , yes there are still LP folks out here . nothing a 20 dollar bill PYLE pre-amp from Amazon did n't `` fix '' I consider this a mid level as opposed to entry level system and recommend .

Bought this product last month and it has been working out really great . All cool features and easy set up . Only thing is Wireless Internet did n't go well with G Router so I ended up having wired connection and it is working flawlessly since then . Netflix , Youtube , Pandora etc. . . works wonderfully . About wireless speaker they are still wired but not connected directly to the main speaker . So You do n't need to run the wire through the room but still rear speakers need to be connected to the device which will communicate to the Blu ray player . So far,S-AIR is working out good . I am yet to test 3D . Will update comments once I get it tested . Overall , great product , great features and great price . 	Home Theater System
I have owned these speakers from Aug\/Sept of 2011 . They are very good surround sound speakers for a 7.1 setup . I have everything matched with Sony products , so these compliment the look of my home theater . The sound is great for sound effects , when the scene in a movie permits . They are good for music , but not as primary speakers . I have the Sony SS-F6000 's in the front . I recommend them also as they get the full sound that the surround sound 's lack . This set of speakers are worth it in my opinion , as I only paid 169.99 + tax for them new at Best Buy . As for the Sony SS-F6000 speakers Amazon also should have them cheap . I paid 119.00 shipped . The receiver I have running everything is Sony STR-DN1010 . It is a very good receiver as well . I bought the receiver the same time as everything too . I only paid $ 199.00 for the receiver . You can buy a newer version for the same price now if you shop smart . Good Luck I say buy it , unless you want more higher end products . Then I say look for Martin Logan , Bowers and Wilkins , or Focal 's $ 30.000.00 speakers -- each ! 	Home Theater System
I bought this system about a month ago , and so far its proven to be great ! It hooks up perfectly to my playstation 2 , digital cable box , and even computer -LRB- for mp3s -RRB- . One of the only downsides is there is only 2 audio in 's , an optical digital in , and a coaxital in , but I 've managed to fit everything , without constantly wire swaping . I suggest this system to anyone in search of a hometheater system . 	Home Theater System
Get this audio system for your Television and you have instant home theater ! It comes with a high quality DVD Player and a subwoofer so you have everything you need for a home theater system . It is extremely easy to hook up . Three of the speakers have screw terminals which are a much better connection . At 550 watts it is really powerful . This is a great value ! 	Home Theater System
I purchased this system because of the wireless capabilities , well right out of the box the wireless tower does not work . Not a good start ! I will be calling support today . To be continued . <p> Well strike two and I 'm done . I sent the first one back because the wireless tower did not work right out of the box . They sent me another one , and guess what ? It did n't work either . When I talked to Samsung support they sounded as if this was happening a lot ? I think they need to work the bugs out before they ship the product out . 	Home Theater System
Works ok with some DVDs . The only reason I bought was for the radio included in but it was not worth the trouble . In 12 months it has spent atleast 2 months getting fixed . The DVD doesnt open and they dont know whats the fix for it . Said they added some lubricant to open but it failed again . Then they changed the laser head dont know why but even that doesnt seem to help 	Home Theater System
I 'm new to sound systems , and am by no means an audiophile . What I wanted was something to improve the sound from my tv in a small space -LRB- a den -RRB- . For that purpose alone , the system works fine . However , the reason this gets 3 stars and not 4 is that no matter how the settings are adjusted , the sound seems to come predominantly from the sound bar , which sounds thin to me . The rear speakers , which are quite small , seem to produce very little sound . Is it better than my tv ? Absolutely . It also has a small footprint , which was important to me . What gets me is the price . I just do n't feel it was worth the amount paid . I regret not giving the lesser expensive Yamaha HTIB with individual side speakers a try instead of this sound bar system . 	Home Theater System
I assembled it last night and figured where I wanted to put the speakers and what to do about the wiring etc. . It 's early on but the assembly was simple and I am loving the wireless rear speakers . The major part of my house is surrounded in rich music \/ movies \/ etc. . The coverage is absolutely amazing . As I said , it 's early on but I am loving it . 	Home Theater System
Got this thing for my girlfriend as a Christmas gift . Hooked everything up Christmas eve , she was so excited , then the DVD player did n't work . Wo n't read DVD 's or CD 's . Thanks for ruining her Christmas KLH ! That is why I buy Sony only ... learned my lesson on this one . 	Home Theater System
Terrible , terrible terrible ! Please do n't give RCA your money . This thing freezes multiple times during playback -LRB- and it 's not the disc , we have put brand new discs in with the same results -RRB- . When I called their help line , they acted like they knew it was a problem , but required a receipt for me to send it in for repair\/exchange . Since I bought it online , I do n't have that and now I 'm stuck with some nice speakers , but a worthless player . Plus , the speakers have the bare wire plug-ins -LRB- push down on the spring loaded button and insert the wire to connect -RRB- and it does n't seem that many systems even use that anymore . Stay away ! Far , far away ! 	Home Theater System
I use it in my bedroom and the sound quaility is much better than the TV speaker , the output is not too lound as use in a bedroom , the only draw back is it has no HDMI input , so you can not connect any HDMI device to it . 	Home Theater System
Need a space-saving system with big sound ? Buy this now !! Panasonic have done really well with this baby . The sound is excellent with both music and movies . And the system is packed with features such as HDCD , HighMAT and JPEG decoders . Unusually , MP3 discs sound great here , and my tracks are 160Kbps !! Oh , the tuner sounds REALLY good too . The system sounds excellent even at low volumes . So there 's some merit to the not-too-tasteless Bi-Amp logo in the front . It 's very nearly perfect but ... I briefly tested DVDs on the system but was using the supplied cable for normal composite video , and the colors were a bit muted . But I suspect the crappy cable is the demon here , and anyway when I get my own TV I 'll be using the component video outputs which should be much better . There 's S-Video output too . To nitpick further DVDs are reset when the system goes to standby , but luckily there 's a memory function which is dead quick to use . The engineers were obviously on cheap drugs when they made this oversight . But there is a 5 disc memory , yes this system is a 5-disc changer !! And lastly the remote , good luck if you have chunky fingers heh heh heh ! Tips : The speaker cable lengths supplied are miserly , consider getting additional lengths , and do n't worry the sound will not deteriorate . I 've had to extend them by 4 metres with a different type and I bought cheapos , which means an extra 16 metres for myself as the Panny is bi-wired - which probably accounts in part for the great sound . A pain but worth it . For music listening by all accounts play with the Equalizer but leave the Surround off , it 's a bit too artificial . Leave the equalizer on , even if left on the flat Manual mode , the sound opens up a bit . The Audio Only mode makes no audible difference , so leave it off and save your chunky fingers ! The blue backlighting looks nice but there 's a Dimmer if it gets distractive . Yes those engineers thought of everything but left a half-assed resume . For movies , by all accounts play with the Surround ! All in all this is a great system . And in the States it 's a no-brain bargain . And did I mention the speakers look great !! Take the grills off ! 	Home Theater System
This product worked well for a year . Now the dvd drive is dead . I wish I had spent more money on a better quality system . I purchased this product based on reviews on Amazon.com . $ 220 down the tubes . 	Home Theater System
I received the package quickly and in good quality . I read alot of the reviews on this model prior to buying it to see what CONs I would be facing . I found mixed reviews and decided to go with it . After I received the system I immediately hooked it up . cables were alittle short but I did n't mind . The overall quality of the sound was great . Overall I am enjoying the setup . 	Home Theater System
Great system except for one glaring flaw . If you have a Samsung TV and a cable box or satellite box that is n't Anynet compatible and you use HDMI cables to connect everything , the input source will always default to Digital Input . As a practical matter what this means is that no matter what remote you use to control the system , you will always have to also grab the Home Theater remote and change the input source . Total pain in the rear . See the following discussion thread on Cnet . Thought a harmony remote might solve the problem but it does n't . 	Home Theater System
Well , I 'd like to warn everyone about a serious -LRB- in my view -RRB- shortcoming of this system , which to me came as a big surprise . I am not a tech junkie , so I did my research in mainstream media - Consumer Report , Amazon etc. . . and I have n't seen this emphasized anywhere - there is no Optical \/ Coaxial Audio Input ! Well , I did n't know what it means , but now I do - you have to connect your cable box to the system via regular Red\/White cable . Thus , if you have a digital cable where many TV programs -LRB- movies , football , etc. . . -RRB- come in 5.1 , you ca n't get the full 5.1 out of home theater . Only when you watch DVDs or listen to Cds . Now , I am NOT a TECH PERSON , and I love several things about the system - very easy to set up , one unit does DVD and VCR , etc. . . It plays DVDs great , both video and sound . Yet , unless someone can explain to me how to overcome the above mentioned shortcoming , I am planning on going through the hustle of packing everything back and returning the item . Another warning - customer service was n't very helpful , in responding to question on setting up the system . Best of luck ! 	Home Theater System
I took a little risk with this purchase because I was aware of the problems reported with the LED lights . I hoped that this was a relatively old problem that had been addressed by now . So far the Vizio soundbar has performed flawlessly . The sound is excellent and the system is small , easy to set up and unobtrusive . I was confused for a moment because of an error in the Quick Start Guide . Step 5 says to connect the subwoofer using the AC adapter , but in the system I received the adapter is for the soundbar .

I am FAR from an ` audiophile ' , but I do recognize and appreciate quality sound when I hear it . This system is UNBELIEVEABLE , and I managed to find it on sale @ a mere $ 129 ! I am remodeling a large vessel , so ` down-sizing '' is an important word . In the last 4 months , I have been through SIX systems , from Sony , Panasonic , RCA , Philips , and 2 Samsung units , with prices ranging from -LRB- yes -RRB- $ 129 to over $ 600 . `` Woulda , coulda , shoulda '' - - If I had any idea of the amazing quality of sound , the ease of use , the flawless operation of this 5-disc system , I ` woulda , coulda , shoula ' scooped up as many as I could have grabbed . No two hour reading lesson on `` How to Use Your Remote '' or other needless technical stuff . I 've had it for 3 weeks and NOT ONE FLAW ! The other units I 've tried have `` eaten '' CD 's & DVD 's , refused to play others , frequently ` skipped ' over DVD images , or simply been far too complex to use . The best of the others was also made by Samsung , but with the ` tower ' speaker\/sub-woofer combo it was just too large for use on the boat . But my sister loves it ! I enjoy the ` glow in the dark ' feature of the remote -LRB- but it so simple , I now know the ` touches ' by heart -RRB- . I DO wish it would continue to play a disc when I want to open the tray to add or change one , but I do n't think the ` carousel ' multi-disc systems have that capability . A small inconvenience . If - - and I have a sense that is a BIG `` IF '' - - I encounter problems with the system , I 'll add another review as I know these are helpful . I was concerned about a system at only $ 129 , but I would happily have paid twice that amount for what I got ! ECB - - Ventura , CA `` The Spirit of Troy '' 	Home Theater System
Just purchased one this weekend . The system overall is really nice . It is easy to setup and the sound is really good . The only problem I have is that it is n't as loud as I would have liked . I put it in a very large room and the sound gets lost with all the space . If you have a large room i would recommend at least a 1000watt system . But even in the large room it sounds pretty good . I 'm not disappointed in my purchase . 	Home Theater System
We 've only had this item for a month but I have to say we 're well pleased with it . We have a large -LRB- 18 ' x 25 ' -RRB- living room but still did n't feel like we needed one of the large 5-speaker systems . What we love about this Sony is -LRB- a -RRB- super easy to use - you do n't feel like you need to go back to college and get an engineering degree to operate it ; -LRB- b -RRB- the sound is extremely good . The bass will blow you away on the DVD 's & CD 's and , yes , it 's adjustable ; and -LRB- c -RRB- it co-operates with our Harmony remote for the most part . There is one minor issue with the Harmony in that it wo n't go back to the correct input when changing from watching a DVD to watching TV , so you have to inform the Harmony that all is not right and it will go through a series of questions to correct itself . That glitch , however , is not Sony 's fault but Harmony 's and we hope that Harmony will create a `` fix '' for it soon . And finally -LRB- d -RRB- it was super inexpensive to purchase . Bottom line , so far we 're very happy . 	Home Theater System
I have been wanting a home theater system for a long time and this one was a great first choice . The instructions take a little longer to digest through than I thought they would , but within 2 hours everything was set up , adjusted and I was watching a dvd . Great for someone who already has a dvd player they like and only needs the basic system . I live in an apartment and the sound is fantastic . 	Home Theater System
I am very disappointed with this speaker system . The lousy speakers on my tv sound much better . I had to turn it off at first , but then experimented a little more . It sounds half way decent if you are only listening to music . Kind of like an old garage sale radio . It sounds terrible for tv and movies though , which is what I bought it for . The sound is very flat , and even though I turned the rear speakers up all the way , they were barely audible . I would n't really suggest this system for anyone , even those on a limited budget like me . You can find a system that sounds better in most garbage dumpsters . 	Home Theater System
This unit is a nightmare . The instructions appear to have been written by someone with Alzheimer 's . There seems to be no logic to the operation of the unit nor is it there anything intuitive about it . Every time you want to do something new with the unit , expect to commit a major chunk of time puzzling over the manual . The remote is made of some aluminum-type metal that rapidly corrodes and partially obscure the names on the buttons . It can be incredibly hard retrieving a disk from the tray and the headphone jack is loose . The sound is fine for the price and I could care less about the appearance . 	Home Theater System
I had a little trouble hooking it up to the television . I had to call tech support an we got it hook up to my direct tv cable box an it works just fine ! Clear sound an everything . 	Home Theater System
I do n't know why so many people have issues with this system . It still works excellent to this day , I have an optical audio setup with my xbox slim and HD sony and they all work beautifully in concert . The subwoofer is powerful and the speakers are also pretty powerful . There have been no issues with the disc ejection system at all . 	Home Theater System
I replaced a $ 90 Rowenta with this iron and am very pleased so far . It is truly a no nonsense classic iron - heavy , glides easily , forms steam quickly , and does not leak . Unlike the Rowenta I returned , it does not have a flashy LED , flashy temperature selection dial or a soleplate with 400 holes , but it works far better than any other iron I have used . 	Iron
I do n't iron a whole lot , but I 've been very pleased with this T-fal iron . It heats up fast and it gets HOT . It does n't leak or drip while heating up and that is one thing that drove me crazy about my old iron . I used this iron on some really crumpled up\/wrinkled curtain panels and had them done in no time . The iron glides very smoothly and I did n't have to hold it over the worst winkles like I would have with my old iron , I glided over them an extra time or two and that was enough to remove even the deepest creases . I ca n't believe the difference between this iron and my old iron , I might even find myself ironing a little more . Great price too . 	Iron
Great product from Panasonic . To describe the features of this Iron in one sentence : `` Its an amazing piece '' . I am sure 99 % of those who purchase this are complacent . 	Iron
Bought the Rowenta travel iron for my cruise holiday , best travel iron ever . Nice compact size and comes in it 's own zip up pouch . Has great functions the best one being the steamer . It 's even better than my own house iron . 	Iron
I bought this steamer for $ 40 from the vendor at a shopping mall . I bargained hard and found later that it was useless and expensive for this quality -LRB- how much is the proper price anyway ? -RRB- My only purpose was to use for cotton dress shirts , but it does not work . And just a few days ago , I found some hard brown stuff where you plug in that was formed somehow , so it became truly useless . 	Iron
I traveled all over Italy with this iron and it is fantastic ! Heats up quickly - lots of steam and packs easily . If you have a full size Rowenta - you know it 's power . If you travel , you definitely need this iron ! 	Iron
I had a Rowenta before getting this iron and I like this one much better . This iron feels sturdy , glides good and the soleplate never got dirty . After two years of moderate use it started to leak and now it does it so much that it soaks my clothes . I was very happy with it until it started to leak . 	Iron
I sew for a living and this iron is the best I have seen . One of my sewing students had the iron and I liked the way it worked and needed one myself . I ordered it and have not been sorry . It heats fast which is an advantage with the safety turn off . The steam is great and I hardly ever have to use the burst of steam . I would certainly recommend this iron . 	Iron
I had a Panasonic iron that I used probably for about 10 years , then somehow it died . So since I 'm a Panasonic user , I had to get this , epically from reading all the good reviews . And I definitely have to regrets from buying this . It 's around the same price as the other brand irons , so why not choose Panasonic over the other ones ? It 's very easy to use and heats up fast . The ironing itself is smooth and problem-free . HIGHLY RECOMMENDED . 	Iron
My wife says this is the best iron she 's ever wielded and I must admit our clothes look better . The iron is light , glides easy , and she loves how easy it is to add water . She also likes how it will output steam while vertical . A really nice product . 	Iron
When my 10 year-old iron finally gave out , it was time to seek a replacement . I did a lot of searching through reviews across the net as to what the best iron for the buck would be . I 'm the kind of guy that will take a week to carefully research my electronic purchases before pulling the switch . I was amazed to find that company like Black & Decker , who I have come to trust , have gotten horrid reviews for their irons . I picked this Hamilton Beach 14415 simply because it looked to have simple functionality and good reviews . I could not be happier . Know how simple this iron is to use ? You plug it in , push one of three backlit buttons -LRB- LOW , MEDIUM , HIGH -RRB- and wait about a minute . When the iron is ready to go it emits short beeps . What could be easier ? The iron emits a nice stream of steam . It seems like a solidly built product . There is no leakage from the water fill . I agree wholeheartedly with other comments that say THIS is the iron you need to buy . I promise it will be the best iron in its price range . Get it now ! 	Iron
A fine product ; does exactly what it claims - - flattens dough to the size of a tortilla . Easily . A couple of suggestions if the manufacturer reads these comments : The hinge pivot is a little loose fitting , resulting in the tortilla turning out a little thicker at the hinge end . It 's a solid hefty appliance . Its cast iron bottom could benefit with a few non-scratch . e.g. teflon bumpers to protect counter tops . Good product ; good price . 	Iron
For what it costs and the features that it has it 's a pretty good iron . My only concern would be that I have had a couple T-fal irons that the cord support has broken on in the past and this looks to be the same design . I have a polished stainless steel iron as well that is also non stick without the coating . I have had a t-fal non-stick befor that the non stick started to come off . Time will tell how this one holds up . Seems that rivets on jeans and catching snaps or clasps on clothes has nicked the coating before . Not had that problem with this one yet . Heats up quickly . 	Iron
The tortilla press works perfectly , after a little practice . Our first batch was an experiment that gave us the correct pressure to apply along with the time and heat to cook the tortillas . We also found that cutting the sides of a freezer storage bag to provide a surface for the pressed tortillas worked best for lining the tortilla press . We just had a fiesta and served a large batch of homemade tortillas , thanks to the Victoria Cast Iron Tortilla Press . 	Iron
Works as advertised , I am pretty happy with it considering its like a digital upgrade to my old el cheapo iron . It did feel a bit heavier at first but once I started using it I actually prefer it now since it requires less effort . Where my old iron failed -LRB- wasting energy and effort -RRB- to get the wrinkles and creases out , the D6000 quickly took care of it . The blue and white color scheme and display are attractive . More functions also make it more useful -LRB- I like the spray option -RRB- . All in all its a great iron , though with all the electronic features I just hope that it will last as long as the old school irons since more electronic parts = more stuff that can break down . 	Iron
This iron leaks like crazy while steaming . I 've used it less than two total hours and HATE it !!! 	Iron
The temperature dial is poorly designed as noted by another reviewer . It is very difficult to turn , which would be annoying to do every use . Lucky for me , the first time I pressed the steam button it pulled the handle away from the iron . Two little screws were n't doing the job . I am sending this back and looking for a different iron . 	Iron
I have more than one T-Fal irons . T-Fal is my favorite brand of iron . I love the way it irons . It wipes wrinkles right out , the steam feature is great and works really well , and the cord never gets in my way when ironing . Sure , it 's kind of expensive for an iron but it makes ironing so much easier . For me , the price is worth it . I think you 'll like the T-Fal Ultraglide Easycord Iron as much as I do . 	Iron
I 've only had this iron for about a month or so , but it kicks my old Black and Decker out of the water -- heats up fast , lots of steam , love the retractable cord and on top of that , what a reasonable price ! Very happy with this purchase . 	Iron
This is the 2nd one we 're ordered . My husband `` likes '' to iron so he irons a lot . We got this iron before and it is great . But when it stopped working , we knew we wanted to replace it with the same one . It is affordable , light weight , and works so well . If it goes out , we will just get another one . 	Iron
This is a nice heavy iron , which is what I want . The only feature I do not care for is the automatic shut-off . However , I 'm guessing that irons must have the automatic shut-off by law , so I probably would not even be able to find an iron without this feature . All-in-all I would recommend this iron to others and I would buy another one -- in fact I already did . I bought two so that I would have another one if this one goes out ! 	Iron
Really wonderful product , especially for the price . Good weight , but not too heavy , excellent steam power , heats up quickly . Excellent . 	Iron
I 've had this iron for a year and I use it very regularly . It 's a very good iron for the money . It 's nothing fancy - it just has your normal basic features -LRB- steam , auto-off , etc. -RRB- . I like that the sole of the iron is just stainless steel and not Teflon -LRB- which scratches over time in my experience -RRB- . The iron is made in China , so looking at other reviews , some people got ones that did n't hold-up as well - Chinese quality control that we are all familiar with . But all-in-all , for $ 20 bucks or so , this is a solid choice , 	Iron
I have had a T-fal iron since college and have never had a problem with it . It saw daily use -LRB- back when I had time to iron daily ! -RRB- and was often used by my roommates who did n't own irons . When our teenage nephew moved in with us , he commandeered the iron for himself , leaving me without an iron . I did not hesitate to get another T-fal iron , based on the performance and long life -LRB- so far -RRB- of my previous iron . This one is exactly what I expected -- heavy enough -LRB- but does n't wear out my arm -RRB- , good steam , non-stick plate . I do n't particularly like ironing -LRB- does anyone ? -RRB- but having a good iron makes the task much less tedious . I hope to get many years from this iron -LRB- so far it 's only been 2 months -RRB- but so far am very pleased . 	Iron
I have used Rowenta for years now , and have always loved the way I was able to get the burst of steam that I so desired , in which to help press out those stubborn wrinkles . The only reason I needed a new iron was due to I burnt out my iron , and it was time after about 10 years for a new one . I read several reviews from people regarding this iron , and thought I was getting a good iron for a descent price , especially since I could not afford a Rowenta at this time . Well I was wrong , this iron is not worth the product used to make it . The burst of steam is a joke , and the water chamber holds only enough water to iron about 2 to 3 shirts . You get one burst of steam -LRB- if you are lucky -RRB- then you have to wait some time before you are allowed to get another one . My old Rowenta when I hit the burst of steam used to push the iron up off the ironing board , I can sneeze harder then the Panasonic 's burst of steam . If you hit the burst button more than once you now get water leaking out of the steam jets , which then gives you water marks on your clothes . I iron quite a lot each week , and what used to take me about a half an hour now takes me almost 2 hours to do . Do n't waste your money on this item , if you want something better take my advice and spend the extra money and buy Rowenta . 	Iron
Iron is a bit bulky but durable . I have difficulty smoothing out small creases , that would be easier with a more narrow iron . Easy to use . Find your fabric in the chart , press the appropriate button . When the button stops blinking , you 're ready to go . The floating red ball shows the water level . Overall good purchase . 	Iron
-LRB- The following review was written before my 6-week-old iron just stopped working one day -- lights on , no heat . I replaced it with the same model , but the new appliance smells like melting plastic and spits water along with the steam . Quality control issues at B&D ? Apologies to the 4 readers who liked my review . What follows is my original 5-star review . -RRB- I look for very little in an iron -- it has to be well-balanced , have an auto-off feature and get hot enough for my quick style of pressage . This iron has these features and a few more nice touches . The fill indicator is so oriented that I do n't have to move the appliance to see whether it is full , The auto-off light doubles as a heat indicator light , turning green when the iron is hot enough , red when it 's not and blinking red when it has shut itself off . And it heats up mighty fast ! My only worry is about the cap for the water reservoir , which gimbles up on fragile-looking plastic struts that would easily break if hit the wrong way . Also , the retractable cord is a feature I have no use for . But for the money , about $ 28 at Walmart , this appliance is very well-designed , works extremely well , and is just about perfect . 	Iron
Old iron broken , needed replacement . Also inspired to get one with cord that retracts , tired of waiting to wrap cord around hot iron , so wonderful ! Iron works great , just what I needed . Do n't need fancy expensive one , happy with this ! Plus pretty with the green and white . 	Iron
My boyfriend bought this for our European trip this fall at a kiosk in Las Vegas . After 1 use it leaves brown spots all over your clothes ! Do not buy ! This iron does not work good at all and it gets too hot besides leaves brown particles all over . We will not be taking this on our trip and it is a rip off ! 	Iron
the base of the handle gets very hot when it is plugged in . I was concerned that it was a wiring problem so I returned it . 	Iron
While a decent iron , I am not very impressed with how hot it gets . Even at the highest setting the iron only gets warm . I guess that means I do n't have to worry about burning anything . Also , it does not generate a lot of steam . I would say hardly any stream at all , again using the highest setting . The one saving grace is this iron does not leak . All in all , this is an ok iron for the price . I would prefer an iron a little hot when necessary . 	Iron
I have wanted to get one of these for some time . Finally bought one after reading reviews . I followed the directions using heavy plastic zippered bag cut open as a liner . Worked great . I had tried doing tortillas with wax paper and it just stuck to the paper . This worked great . My first try was perfect . It did not take a lot of pressure . A couple of practice shots and it is easy to know where to put your ball of dough . I did corn tortillas , which is what I was having so much trouble with trying to roll them out with wax paper . Ca n't wait to try them on flour tortillas . Now if I can figure out exactly how to cook them so they are still flexible . Following the directions , they seem to come out pretty stiff . Anyway - I am happy with the press . 	Iron
This iron surpassed my expectations . For a very reasonably priced iron , it does a great job . I have had very pricey irons and honestly , this one does just as good a job as any . It 's lightweight , glides smootly over fabric . I like the steaming feature , which is more powerful than other irons I 've owned . Would definitely recommend , especially to someone who 'd like to save money . 	Iron
So far I love this iron and I will be able to judge better after I see how long it is going to function without problems of spitting and sputtering . I use only filtered water in my irons . I like Panasonic products . I like the steam settings and the pointed tip which makes it easier to iron around buttons . I also like the stored cord and the titanium coated plate . Also does a great job ironing . What more can I say ? I would recommend this iron to family and friends . 	Iron
Beyond expectation , best in class . Out performed and delivers over and above irons triple the price . Well done Black & Decker . 	Iron
Let me start by saying my # 1 use for an iron is to press garments as I sew . I need something that presses well , and produces steam reliably . Unfortunately , this iron does n't do the latter . Many times I have to shake it to get it going , other times even when I 've got the steam function on and am shaking it , it ignores me . It does get hot fast and press decently , but seriously , I should not have to be shaking an iron to make the steam go . Now that it has started making strange boiling sounds and spitting water at my fabric intermittently , I 'm giving up on this model and trying a different one . I do n't recommend this iron . 	Iron
I love this iron . I have purchased several irons in my lifetime . . -LRB- I 'm 50 + -RRB- , but this iron is a very good iron . It is sturdy and heavy , and gets the job done . Other irons I have used do not compare to the `` Classic '' . I have looked high and low for this iron in department stores and other retail stores ; which either have the newer Black and Decker brand or do n't have it at all . The only reason I am repurchasing this iron is due to human error -LRB- dropping it -RRB- . That is why I am glad I found another one online and ordered it . Delivery was very very fast . 	Iron
I dropped my first iron like this , so I had to buy another one . I really like this iron . It sits between my sewing machne and embroidery machine . It does not do what a bid iron will dok , but it is great for seams and the inbetween stuff . Will buy it again if I drop this one . 	Iron
Man it 's really hard finding a heavy duty iron these days that really iron like the cleaners . My mother-in-law has this iron and we use it everytime we drive out of state to visit . After Going through about 2-3 irons this year from walmart , we decided to look online for the classic . The same one my mother-in-law had . And we found it and will never use another cheap metal iron again . I do n't know how long this iron has been around , but it is like those heavy irons from back in the day your grandmother use to use and your sister use to straighten her hair with . You wo n't find a good iron out there that steams and presses your jeans like this one . You wo n't regret this buy . 	Iron
"<ahref=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001AMN4DC/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/185-3726580-7816045""> Panasonic NI-S300TR 1200-Watt Steam Iron with Curved Titanium-Coated Soleplate , White\/Green </a> I purchased this iron to replace the Panasonic NI-A56NR . I had it for several years till the cord was destroyed . Loved the automatic cord reel and the curved soleplate . It slid over everything with no effort . My new Panasonic NI-S300TR has all the same features as the last one with the exception that the cord reel works even better ! I think they may have increased the size of the reel housing to do this but I did not even notice this till I went to put it away and noticed that it was a bit taller than my last iron . The steam function works great and I love that I can select to have steam or dry iron at the flip of the thumb . I tried a different Shark from a local store and you could not even use the steam unless the iron was on the hottest setting and it claimed to be a `` professional '' model . To make a long story short , `` Buy it '' ! "	Iron
Needed a metal rack for my guest room antigue quilt . I painted this one white to match the room and the quilt . It turned out very well and looks great in the corner with the quilt . Very nicely made for the price and even looked good before painting it . 	Iron
I had used 3 irons before trying this one . This one works the best on all types of clothes . Love it . Highly recommend this to anyone who is looking for perfectly ironed clothes . 	Iron
I owned this for one year . It suddenly stopped steaming on either side . For the money I paid for it , I am very disappointed . Will not buy abpnothervBlack and Decker nor spent that kind of money . 	Iron

Great Things About This Iron : ---------------------------- + Heats up Fast + Very Stable when you stand it up + No drip spray\/steam + Slides smoothly over any garment Things I Wish Were Better : ------------------------- - Occasionally steams without you pressing the button . - Can not wind cord around handle This is a great iron , it is nice and heavy and slides over anything under it . It heats up to your desired temperature in seconds . A word of advice , if you have some garments that need steaming and others that do n't , start ironing with the ones that do n't . I notice that when I have water in the iron , sometimes it will start steaming without me pressing the button . Other than that , the steam works great . It does n't drip , steams evenly and sounds cool when you press the steam button . You can also spray water on the garment from the front of the iron . It is a little bit of a pain to store because the cord does n't wind around the iron . SO you have to wind it up and twist tie it every time . But these are minor things . The iron works well and I can have my clothes looking nice in no time . 	Iron
I needed a new steam iron for my sewing room -LRB- quilting and clothing -RRB- and this turned out to be a super choice . Quick response and most importantly it turns itself off when left to sit in between pressings . 	Iron
This T-fal iron is undoubtedly fine quality and the features are attractive , but even for a premium model I find it very heavy and way too big . For that reason I give it a low rating . I am waiting for a full-featured , premium iron that is feather-light and small enough to be manueverable . Perhaps with the new ceramics and composites technologies they will finally be able to make a really neat iron that does n't feel like you 're carrying a 20-lb . New York Yellow Pages . 	Iron
The iron just glides very easily compared to others my family has used and we enjoy the convience of the hide away cord . 	Iron
I bought this iron to replace a Rowenta that lasted about 2 years . This iron lasted 2 months and simply stopped working , no heat , nothing . What is it with irons these days ? They used to last years . I am tired of paying over and over again for junk . Make the darn things in the US ! 	Iron
It is faster to used this press and it is well made . I still had better tortilla 's from my 10 '' wooden rolling pin . I think I might have to adjust my tortilla recipe I 've been using for years to make it a little more wet so press can produce thinner results . 	Iron
Works very well especially as it is so light , retractable cord handy . Impressed would buy it again . 	Iron
Not hot enough to iron a rayon shirt . I was disappointed because I bought this iron specifically because the other reviewers said it got really hot . But ours did n't . I returned it . 	Iron
My old iron is just about ready to retire and I was looking around for an inexpensive but good iron when I received this T-fal iron with a non-stick soleplate . I love the gliding feel of this iron , it literally slides on the clothes and smooths out creases effortlessly . It works great on cotton which is the material I iron most anyway . The iron itself warms up quite quickly and steams well . My iron does appear to drip onto the clothes -LRB- when the water well is filled -RRB- to the point that I was getting a little frustrated in trying to control the drip while ironing my clothes . I reduced the amount of water I placed in the water well and that seemed to help a lot , so perhaps that is a viable solution . The auto switch-off feature is a great safety feature , not to mention to preserve one 's clothes from being burnt . For the price here , and for the results I observed , I think this is a handy , practical , and user-friendly iron . 	Iron
For the most part , I 've been very pleased with this iron . It heats up quickly , does n't drip , and the steam function works great . However , there are a couple of features that I sure would have liked , and would have made this a 5 star review . The lack of any sort of storage for the cord is frustrating , I would have liked some sort of `` prongs '' like my old iron -LRB- for wrapping the cord around -RRB- or a retractable cord . I 've yet to figure out a quick and tidy way to store the cord on this iron . Also , like another reviewer , I sew . I really do not care for the settings dial on this iron , I would have preferred something with fabric settings . But overall it 's a good sturdy iron . 	Iron
Purchased this at a Las Vegas kiosk in the Miracle Mile Shops without having seen these reviews . The demonstration made it look like it worked wonders . I did notice the salesman wipe away some brown liquid when he opened the demo product to add water . He did it quickly and made nothing of it . -LRB- smooth -RRB- Took it home , tested it out . If you do n't add salt , it does not produce any steam at all . It just gets very hot . If you do add the 3 little spoons of salt , you see the steam as produced at the kiosk demo . However , I tried using it on one of my Express shirts -LRB- polyester -RRB- and it took out zero wrinkles . The bottom of the iron got extremely hot , dangerous to touch . When I unplugged it , it produced noticable sparks . I left the water in the steamer for 6 hours and when I opened it to toss it out , it was brown . This must be a product of the salt , water , and heat . This product is an absolute sham . The ONLY REASON they are still in business is because they have a NO RETURN policy . Italsteam sucks . Spend a little more and purchase a professional steamer . I wish I read the reviews before I bought it . 	Iron
I bought one of these irons several years ago and I love it . It gets really hot , which is why I iron , and it is heavy enough to iron things rather than just a touch-up . So , I bought another one a few years ago , but it did n't get as hot as my original iron . I kept using the hotter , original , but the plate where you move the button for the various heat settings has become loose and so I decided to buy another one . Wow ! this one is really terrible ! It does n't get very hot , it shuts off when I do n't want it to , and the soleplate does n't glide smoothly . When I am talking about how hot the iron gets , I want the fabric to feel HOT after I run the iron over it on the highest setting . I iron a lot of cotton and linen fabrics , and I need it hot . I think that the merchandise that is not made in the USA anymore really varies in consistency . And I notice that items are getting tackier and of poorer quality . Fabrics are not what they were , appliances are not the best quality and when you buy curtains and draperies , they do n't even match up in length . This generation of consumers has nothing to compare the quality of imported products to , but I am finding -LRB- in my old age -RRB- the great quality that we used to have is sadly eroding . I think we should get back to making our own products again , and instead of buying quantity we should look for quality and take care of the things that we purchase instead of throwing everything out when it does n't work right . Goods might be cheaper now , but they are certainly not better . 	Iron
The main reason that the classic version of this iron was so wonderful was because it was one of the very few irons on the current market that did NOT have the auto shut off feature . The addition of this feature has ruined this iron ! For the casual person who only irons clothes , this feature is understandable . However , for those of us who sew , it is no longer functional . When I sew , I sew for hours at a time -LRB- hopefully , I do have a small child -RRB- and the iron can easily sit on its heel for the 8 minutes needed to shut it off . Then , when I do need it - it is already cold ! It is not like I am anti-safety , but there are timers sold at the big box hardware stores that you plug into the outlet and then your iron into it - and there 's a little dinger bell that goes off when the power is cut - 1\/2 hour later . That provides all of the safety that I need and gives me the time I need to actually sew . B&D need to go back to the reason that this model was so successful upon reintroduction in the first place - lack of the stupid auto shut off . If you sew , this is not the iron for you . 	Iron
This is a great iron . It 's the perfect weight and it does a wonderful job . Now if it would just iron my clothes by itself we 'd have a real winner ! 	Iron
I will be honest . I really wanted to like this iron . For several years I have used an iron that drips , runs through water like crazy , and is n't very consistent . Most of the points expressed in the product features are right on . - I ca n't say that it glides as smoothly , especially on `` all fabrics '' as the description indicates , but it is reliable . - The steam function is good . Mine has not dripped when the steam function is turned off , and I really have n't had any trouble with bursts of steam causing issues . In fact , the steam function is probably the most reliable function on the appliance . - The auto-off feature works like clockwork . Beyond the features listed , I will also say that it heats up well . I like the indicator light to let me know when it 's ready to use . And , the steam function activates smoothly and the levels are clearly marked . All of those features were very preferable to my old iron . But , the frustrations with this new iron far outweigh any issues I had with the old one . Some are simply personal preference . - The auto-off time is too short . I sew a lot , and I often need a warm iron while I sew , but I do n't necessarily get back to the iron in under 8 minutes . I personally need an iron that allows at least 15 minutes , if not 30 , before turning itself off . - It is impossible to actually turn the iron off . It must be unplugged . If it is not unplugged , it will turn itself off and then must be unplugged and plugged back in before it will come on again . While I understand the safety feature here , this makes the auto-off extremely more frustrating for my sewing sessions . - It has temperature settings , but not fabric settings . Yes , I 'll admit , I just need to learn what types of fabric like what levels of heat . But , I also have three children who are learning to sew . I greatly prefer an iron that has the fabric settings not only for my own work , but also for teaching them . With a real purchase , as opposed to a review item like this one , I would definitely look for that feature . The last issue , though , is one that I think is a major and universal flaw with the iron . The water level is VERY hard to see . The iron is solid blue and only very slightly transparent . I have to stand with the light behind me landing just right on the iron in order to have any hopes of seeing the water level . Bottom line : I would not purchase this iron . As a reviewer , I will use it , but I will also look forward to the chance to replace it . 	Iron
Read the reviews on about 50 irons . Picked this one because of the ratings . Works great ... especially for the price . If your going to iron 6 times a week suck it up and buy top quality one ... or a steamer . But if your an average iron person and need something great when it needs to be , buy this and enjoy ! 	Iron
so far is working very good . It is light weight and one of the best features is the retractable cord , it makes it much more easy to storage . 	Iron
I have trying to use this product since I bought it -LRB- abt 35 days ago -RRB- . I was not able to press my tortillas bigger than abt 4-5 inches round . I tried all that the reviews suggested here - using wax paper , ziploc bags etc. . But nothing seemed to work . Yesterday I read some reviews that had a one star or two star rating and then it all made sense . As some of the reviews suggested , the iron press has an even plate surface preventing it from pressing all the way down . I just checked it today and I can see the gap on side . I am def returning it ! 	Iron
Bought one at mall kiosk . Went home and checked reviews online . Took it back to the mall next day and asked for refund . I did not even open the box but they refused to take it back . Called customer service number and left voice mails but never got a call back . I threw the box on their face and never looked back . I will never ever buy any stuff from malls kiosks . I just gave them $ 40 for nothing . 	Iron
I just bought this at the mall in Santa ANa CA , the guy said it cost $ 90 but he would give it to me for $ 50 cash , I asked if I could get a refund if I did n't like it he said yes you have to go on their website to do it online ... well I took home try it on a light sweater it worked ok took a few minutes to get wrinkle free but I really wanted to try it on linen since I have difficult time with that . it barely worked and it took FOREVER to steam one side of the shirt , I tried other cotton shirts it worked ok but is not practical nor fast , I need something to save me time and hassle and this thing takes forever ... went back within a couple of hours of purchase to return it they wo n't give me my money and their website does n't have any numbers to call or any options to return the item ... it 's a total scam .

Things I like : 1 -RRB- Pointed tip makes pressing while quilting very precise 2 -RRB- Nice and hot 3 -RRB- Shiny smooth plate glides great Thing I really do n't like : 1 -RRB- Several times while pressing down , the handle will unlock and crush your fingers between the handle and the top of the iron . I remedied this by taking off the clear plastic dial cover and jamming half a rubber cork in the crux of the handle . I wish they would make the iron without a retractable handle and it would avoid this issue altogether . The previous model did not have this problem . I will still by another one . This is a must tool for quilting . 	Iron
Actually , if I had more time , ironing would n't be such a chore . But it is a time-consuming , but necessary task . Any product that can make ironing easier is welcome . The iron glides very smoothly over all kinds of fabrics . I appreciate the long cord and the fact that it 's completely out of the way . The dials are easy to read and responsive . With the exception listed below , the steam and spray functions work well , too . I also like its stable base . There are two reasons for the loss of one star . First , because the blue case is so dark , it 's difficult to tell when the water reservoir is full . I had to hold the iron in front of a window to see the level . Then , when the reservoir was about a fourth full , on the steam setting , water started to spit onto the fabric , requiring several swipes with the iron to dry the spots . I have a different iron with a retractable cord and , although I like it , this cord 's angle and length probably prohibit that feature . All-in-all , this is a good iron , feels sturdy in my hand , and I 'll continue to use it . 	Iron
This iron is a great bang for the buck . It stores a decent amount of water , and heats up pretty quickly . Some positive features include the withdrawable cable -LRB- very handy -RRB- , transparent water gauge , and the spray nozzle . However , these features are not perfect . The withdrawable cable operates on a button that you press which winds it up . However , you often have to feed the cable through because there is n't enough twisting force to retract the cable . The spray nozzle is a nice feature too , but in my opinion it does n't spray in a fine enough mist . Other than that , unless you really know how to take advantage of features offered by other irons , this is a good choice . 	Iron
Does all that I want it to do . Its in use almost every day and continues to perform flawlessly . Have had more expensive irons that did n't perform nearly as well . 	Iron
We wanted an iron that we would only use for making coffee pods and this one is perfect . It gets REALLY hot ... hot enough to seal the pods all the way around so there is no leaking . We 've never tried it on clothes , but it is absolutely perfect for making pods ! 	Iron
The flavor of homemade tortillas is something to experience ! The press makes the process effortless . Organic corn masa harina is very difficult to find . I am fortunate to live in the SF Bay Area so I can find it at the local health food store . 	Iron
I had the `` jig '' for about a month now and I put it through some workout . It is performing rather well so far . But here are some performance and design shortcomings : 1 -RRB- Even with hard pressing -LRB- short of breaking the hinge pin -RRB- the tortilla is still too thick especially as a Taco shell ; I have to use a rolling pin to finish the job !!! more labor and time consuming . 2 -RRB- Although the hinge pin did n't break yet and although they provided you with a spare one , it looks flimsy to me and I am very careful not to push my luck by pressing hard on it . 3 -RRB- It would be nice to : a -RRB- glue rubber pads under the 4 corners of the base or a some sort of `` felt pad '' to the entire bottom to protect the working surface from being scratched by the cast iron . b -RRB- include two round pieces of `` heavy '' plastic to put between the dough and the cast iron surface . Using `` made for home '' plastic wrapping material is a royal pain . Luckily we had a mattress delivered and I cut plastic pieces from its packaging . Keep in mind , this brand is not the cheapest on the market . 	Iron
In a desperate attempt to own an iron , I made the mistake , several years ago , to purchase a Sunbeam . This review is not to criticize Sunbeam ; however , I have to admit I have never had luck with that brand . Ironically , after a couple of years of use , it is still working , but the iron plate is horrible . After receiving my T-Fal iron , I was excited to finally get rid of my old iron , because thanks to the previous one , several articles of clothing were ruined by ugly smears while using the `` steam '' option -LRB- white residue -RRB- . I 'm not one to use an iron on a daily basis ; I iron my slacks , shirts , and other easy-wrinkle items of clothing for work whenever necessary . Therefore , when I first used my new T-Fal , I thought it would iron as any iron should . I was pleasantly impressed within minutes ! The glide was beautiful , so smooth and graceful . My clothes de-wrinkled easily and quickly , unlike my previous iron 's abilities . Other perks : it 's lightweight , has an adjustable temperature setting -LRB- from lowest to highest -RRB- , which I wish was digital , and , finally , will last a long time ! -LRB- I hope -RRB- For periodic use , this is a great iron , and at least you are guaranteed it is a quality brand that will not break down on you . Best to buy when on sale ! 	Iron
It might not be the # 1 iron you can get but I really wonder why so many negative reviews have been posted . I think it does what it 's supposed to do -LRB- iron shirts and pants ! You do n't expect to iron an entire business suit with it , do you ? -RRB- . And the reel is the very reason I bought it . Have n't used it for very long to test how long it works but has worked well so far . 	Iron
I just needed a basic iron for work shirts and I could not be more happy with the purchase . 1 -RRB- EXCELLENT value ! I expected to pay almost twice as much for a trouble free iron . 2 -RRB- Heats up very fast . 3 -RRB- Glides around effortlessly on all my clothes . Curved , titanium sole plate makes a difference . 3 -RRB- Retractable cord is a sweet feature . Watch out for : 1 -RRB- The door to the water tank is somewhat flimsy so be VERY VERY gentle with it . 2 -RRB- If you leave the iron horizontal on the sole plate when turned off , water will leak out . That 's more my fault than the iron 's ... 	Iron
I 'm not actually sure how to review an iron , but I want people to know this is a good product . It works as advertised , is simple to use , and does n't leave disgusting brown streaks or weird burn marks on your clothes like the ones with that non-stick chemical coating . I 've gone through about three or four of that other kind -- the ones you find at Target or Wal-Mart , that advertise all kinds of fancy features , digital temperature displays , etc. . Those things are garbage . This iron seems to have been designed with function in mind more than form . Unlike the others , it works . 	Iron
This iron worked fine for me for a couple uses then began LEAKING OILY BROWN WATER leaving spots . I happened to be ironing silk at the time and it did not come out . I had read this problem in one of the other reviews but there were so many positive ones I figured it was just a fluke and maybe it is , but I 'm pretty sure there are better options out there , so do n't risk it . -LRB- Addition after having this iron for almost a year , I reduce my two star rating down to a one star rating . Wow this product is awful -RRB- When I wrote to the company to tell them about it the told me to go through the cleaning process they have listed in the manual . I should not have to clean something I just bought , I have been limping along with this iron now for about a year I do n't use the steam because it still leaks oily residue but now it seems to have COMPLETELY STOPPED WORKING , It just wo n't turn on . I wish I could give this less than one star . 	Iron
i have always used thia iron and having owned this type of iron i know you can not drop it . this iron was dropped thrown , heaven only knows what it went through just to get to me . if this iron is dropped it will spit out hot water , it will leak , as yo iron it will spit out water and your clothes are wet not steamed just wet . i will never order another iron through the mail . i have had to make anothre purchased .

Was bored today -LRB- had to study while friends are out partying -RRB- , so I went to my local mall and did a impulse buy before reading any review . Not usually me as I am a conscious value buyer , but what the hell . Came back home , check the review on amazon and it was horrendous . I have to say , most of the negative review in my opinion are 1 -RRB- lack of following the instruction -LRB- put too much salt -RRB- and 2 -RRB- the quality is probably better now than a few years ago . Anyone who is planning to get this , I have a few suggestions , 1 -RRB- Learn how to use it there . Tell them you want to try it yourself and they will teach u to use it properly . 2 -RRB- Practice , practice practice , once you get it home . Use crappy cloth first and gradually use better cloth when you feel more comfortable . 3 -RRB- Just put 2 teaspoons of salt instead of 3 , it does the job and does n't produce as much brown residue from the salt . . This product is far from perfect , beside the usual it can get hot and use crapload of electricity -LRB- 500 watts -RRB- . It doesnt take off all the wrinkle , it gets most of it , enough for me that it doesnt embarrass you when you wear it for work . I rather use this product than my current iron , as I do n't need a flatbed . 	Iron
I purchased this iron for travel to Italy where most hotels do not supply irons in the hotel rooms . The iron worked wonderfully and suited its ' purpose . It came with a small storage bag , is fairly lightweight and was small enough to pack in luggage . 	Iron
This iron is , indeed , a classic . The moment I plugged it in and began to iron my shirts , I knew ironing would be easier . 	Iron
I just bought this product . It now has a traditional cast-iron finish -LRB- non plated -RRB- . The plates close exactly as they should and give a uniform thickness easily . No need to press extra hard to get a thin tortilla . Two thumbs up ! 	Iron
I have been using this iron for almost a month now and have had no problems . Great steam and spray . With the cord storage bottom it sits safely on the ironing board . It 's heavier than most irons which I find gets clothes wrinkle-free faster . The only problem I can foresee happening is the cord reel giving out ; I do n't know the lifespan of it . I would buy this iron again . 	Iron
The shipping box the press came in had no filler , so the tortilla press just bounced around in the larger shipping box . I can imagine this is why the handle was broken when I received the press . Very poor shipping process Target ! I returned this item for a refund . I would not recommend ordering this item unless you want to go through the hassle of having to return it . I only gave it one star because I was n't able to use it . This reivew is for Target 's shipping practices , not the item itself . I did n't get a chance to use it because it arrived damaged . 	Iron
This item was sent to me used . It was also missing a main piece , the rivet and screw . I would not recommend this product to anyone . Perhaps if they were able to send the missing piece , I would be willing to recommend it ... but that is not the case . 	Iron
This iron is a great value -- works as well as the very high priced irons . This is my second purchase of this iron ! 	Iron
We were replacing a rather expensive Rowenta that finally gave up the ghost . After perusing many reviews of high-end irons and finding many of them disturbing , we looked at Consumer Reports and their comments about less expensive models . This was one they liked , and Amazon reviewers mostly agreed . We figured there was a chance we were making a mistake spending so little , but if it turns out that way we wo n't be out much . So far , so good . It 's quick to get to temperature , pretty light and ergonomic , steam and spray functions work well , and I love not having to wrap up the cord . We 'll see as months and years go by but , so far , it 's `` Why pay more ? '' 	Iron
Nice looking , white and lime green iron . You can easily see how much water is left through the transparent green top . Water is easy to pour in , and easy to snap close . The retractable cord is really very convenient . When it is time for storage , all you need to do is push a button . From time to time you may need to help it with a little tug or a push , but still way better than having the whole cord dangling around . No annoying cord mess . Good weight balance . Has easy access buttons for the steam and spray functions . The iron is fast on heating , you can use it almost instantly after you plug it in . The bottom part is curved to help slide better on clothes . Still , it does not slide as smooth as our old retired iron . It is heavier than our old iron which helps in pressing the fabric better . That does n't mean it is heavy , in fact , I think the weight is just perfect . There are 3 ways it will auto-turn off . 1 -RRB- Will turn off in 1 minute if you leave it stationary on its flat heating element . 2 -RRB- Will turn off in 1 minute if it was left lying sideways , and 3 -RRB- Will turn off in ten minutes standing on its heel where the retractable cord reel is . Definitely a great upgrade to our old iron . I did look around before making a purchase , I found this to be of great value for the price . 	Iron
This is the second rack we 've purchased -- same model . I bought the first one about two years ago so when the second one arrived the other day , I used the first rack as a model to make assembly go a little faster . After eyeballing both racks assembled , I see some differences . The first is in the finish ; the first rack has a more elegant bronze finish whereas the second has a shinier , black finish and the knobs on top are n't quite as ornate . The second difference is in the weight ; it 's evident that the company has cut back on material costs by using a lower-grade quality of metal . That was apparent when I picked up both racks as the second one is definitely lighter . However , with that said , both racks are very attractive and function as designed . I just think that the company would be better-served not skimping on the initial quality of materials . Still -- I 'd recommend it particularly if you find a deal under $ 50 . 	Iron
Usually do not complain alot about items . But this is just not right . We bought this item because many of my clothes just do better by steaming instead of ironing . We found it in Vegas in a mall and purchased it there . So of course we ca n't return it and I 'm thinking why they set up this place on the strip . How many people would be able to return it ??? We live in another state . But the low down on this is it has been in my suitcase and since I do n't travel often , the item has only been used twice . The item looks brand new as has been protected and well taken care of . But last time I went to use it , it would not heat up and leaks water all over the place . Just a piece of crap . If you want to waste your money then go ahead and purchase . I think I will find another brand as I still would like a small steamer . Use my big one in my home all of time and absolutely love that . 	Iron
Pretty good iron . Easy to handle , does great job ironing . I like the size and weight of this iron . It glides easily and presses perfectly . The iron is not too big , not too small . Easily stores upright on metal stand that I have . 	Iron
I have used the higher priced irons as well as the cheap ones . This one is well worth the price . It is just the right weight . The see-through window on the water tank lets you know when to refill . It is easy to refill under the faucet or with a container . The titanium-coated soleplate makes ironing all material a breez . The retactable cord is exactly what I needed for storage . Just push the button and the cord is retracted into the base . Just like that ! I highly recommend this iron . 	Iron
We paid $ 45 plux tax for this way overpriced piece of junk called ItalSteam . As soon as you get it home and try it , you will immediately know why it says in big print on your receipt `` NO REFUNDS OR RETURNS . '' Too bad we did n't notice this at the time . Only JUNK is sold in this manner ! I could ` iron\/steam ' only 1-1\/2 shirts before it needed refilling . You have to wait until it cools down before you can do that . The steam is uneven and sometimes spits brown spots on your clothes . The cord is too short -LRB- 5 and 1\/2 feet -RRB- to use most places -LRB- ridiculous ! -RRB- . The plastic is lightweight , but that 's because it is so cheaply made . You have to thoroughly clean out the brown stained water after each use and DURING USE is you do n't want to risk having it spewed on your clothes . Also , by reading other reviews on this site for this product , we all paid different prices . I believe this is because it depends upon how reluctant you seem to buy it . The longer you hold out , the cheaper it is going to get . Too bad we did n't know that then . Maybe we would have had a far better purchase at $ 15 instead of -LRB- with tax -RRB- $ 48.71 . What a major RIPOFF !!!!! And it does n't do the proper job on your clothes , either . I wonder what kind of fabric they use to demonstrate it ? From now on , anything we buy at any of those mall kiosks we will ask if it can be returned for a REFUND , NOT an exhange ! And there 's nothing else to exchange this ripoff for except another one !!! Be forewarned !!! 	Iron
a really honest iron . like the old days . Yes , it 's heavy , it 's got good controls , a nice sole plate , ability to be used ambidextrously . what 's not to like ? 	Iron
Used this a few times already , it seems really great . Hope it lasts . 	Iron
I should have known better . After buying a larger Rowenta for my home iron , I purchased this smaller one to take to quilt classes and workshops . Yes , it is light and easy to carry , and served me well for six whole months ! In the meantime , my large Rowenta has quit , -LRB- less than two years old ... -RRB- then last night , while sewing , the iron started to crackle and sputter , then smoke started to come out of it . I unplugged it , did n't want it to explode or something ! This morning when I plugged it in , ... nothing . I 'm done . No more Rowenta products for me . 	Iron
To be completely honest , I 'm a little surprised at myself for having strong enough feelings -LRB- positive or negative -RRB- about an iron to write a review . But , alas , here I am . Very simply , this is the best iron I have ever used . As a male that does not plan ahead well , I tend to iron my clothes on an ad hoc basis , and this iron makes that chore as easy and quick as possible . Pros : 1 . This iron is heavy , even before you fill the reservoir with water . A heavy iron is a good iron . The cheap plastic irons do n't work well for a reason ; they are n't heavy enough to actually press the wrinkles out of clothes . 2 . This iron heats very quickly . When you 're ironing a shirt in the morning trying to get ready for work , speed is key . This iron does not disappoint . 3 . This iron is inexpensive . The price was the same as the aforementioned cheap plastic irons , but is pretty much better in every way . 4 . This iron has simple controls . Kind of a like a blender with an on and off switch , this iron has all of the controls that you need for functionality and no more . Cons : None . 	Iron
It does what it 's supposed to do . Nothing spectacular or special . I find I have to flip my tortilla because once it 's pressed one side seems thicker than the other . My tortillas just do n't seem to come out evenly . 	Iron
I put the T-fal FV3756003 Prima Iron to the test when I was rushing to get dressed for a Valentine 's Day dinner with my best friend . I wanted to wear something that she had never seen . I have a multi-colored striped Henley that I had washed and hung in a closet to dry . Unfortunately , it now needed to be ironed because the hanger had made unsightly wrinkles in the shoulders . The T-fal that I had received from the Amazon Vine Program was still unopened in its box . I quickly grabbed the box , pulled out the iron and , within ten minutes , I had ironed the shirt . I never bothered reading the instructions ; I merely went on memory from using my past two irons which have both been Black & Decker models . My first Black & Decker Iron -LRB- Model Z8 F438 WH -RRB- worked wonderfully ; in fact , I still have it . A few years ago , my mom bought me a spare Black & Decker Iron -LRB- Model F492 8WH -RRB- ; unfortunately , the steam function does n't work well ; I never could figure out how to properly use it . The steam function on my T-fal works great . In fact , there are two separate buttons for the steam and for the spray . The cord is nine inches longer than the one for my newest Black & Decker . Believe me ; nine extra inches can make a world of difference . It 's the difference between the iron staying on the ironing board and it falling off when you are trying to watch television while pressing your clothes . The T-fal heats up quickly . My mom complains that her new Black & Decker wo n't heat up well . I plan on giving her my newest Black & Decker Iron -LRB- Model F492 8WH -RRB- because it will heat up even though it steams poorly . The T-fal -LRB- as one can see from the photographs I 've posted on the Amazon website -RRB- is much larger than my newest Black & Decker . It is taller by several inches ; thus it is much more difficult to store after use . I can barely get it to stand upright on the shelf below the kitchen cabinet where I keep my other irons . It is also heavier than this Black & Decker iron . Consequently , the T-fal is not ideal for traveling . What really frustrates me is the instruction booklet . I am grateful for it considering that many companies save money by forcing their customers to go to their websites for obtaining instructions . However , the instructions in this manual consist of cartoons that are difficult for me to decipher . -LRB- I have downloaded sample pages to the website . -RRB- I did n't grow up reading comic books . I have always read novels . I need words . However , I do appreciate that the manual does have the company 's warnings and precautions completely written in sentence format . Furthermore , there is a page devoted solely to troubleshooting problems . Thankfully , the iron comes with a standard one-year limited warranty . The base on the T-fal is huge . After I finish ironing a shirt , I merely stand the iron on its base . A larger base , combined with a longer cord , makes it less likely for the iron to topple over . Furthermore , the iron automatically shuts off after a few minutes of inactivity . I do n't have to worry about my apartment burning down if I forget to unplug it . Forgetting to unplug the iron when I am rushed is quite possible considering that I work two full-time jobs and I am very active in my church . Overall , the T-fal FV3756003 Prima Iron with PTFE Non-Stick Soleplate is a safe , easy to operate iron . It is highly recommended for household usage . Because of its size , it may be difficult to take on vacations or business trips . Fortunately , when I travel to see my parents over the holidays , I use their iron . Also , many of the upscale hotels now have irons and ironing boards . I believe that the T-fal would make a wonderful gift for the college student , the newlywed , the recently divorced , etc. . Its long , sleek design and blue trim makes it appealing and attractive . I hope to keep this iron for a long time . Joseph B. Hoyos 	Iron
While shopping for a replacement for our Shark Steam Iron I discovered that even the `` best '' irons -LRB- which I would have paid for -RRB- have major detractors . It seems most of these products are made in third world countries using cheap plastic that frequently fails -LRB- even the German brand has lots of complaints -RRB- It seems few will last more than a year or two . Thus I picked a cheaply priced iron with good ratings expecting to have to replace it in the not too distant future . This B and D F1060 is performing beyond expectations so far . It 's light , smooth to use , and all features are working well . I 'll update this report if it fails within a year . 	Iron
The Black and Decker Classic Iron is the perfect iron for any job . I do a lot of ironing everyday and this iron does a better job than all of the expensive brands I have tried . It has a little weight to it , which is what is necessary for that crisp look and set in creases . Great product for the money . 	Iron
I really wanted to like this keyboard\/mouse combo . The keyboard looks slick and has many buttons that you can program so that you can get to a folder or a website or whatever at a click of a button . The mouse , although a little heavy and clunky was nice and responsive and also had a number of different buttons and features . However , all these non-essential bells and whistles can not hide the fact that the product as a whole is a big let down . At random times , the keyboard either shuts down or there is tremendous lag response between hitting the keys and getting a response -LRB- I 'm talking 10-15 seconds ... or sometimes no response at all -RRB- . For gaming purposes , it 's a huge frustration and disadvantage to have your keystrokes fail to register during random unexplainable times . For business purposes , the constant intermittent lag is frustrating and disruptive to the thought processes as these shortcomings will inevitably draw youur attention and focus away from your actual work . I experienced these problems right out of the box . I even installed brand new batteries into both the keyboard and mouse and the problems in responsiveness were noticeable almost immediately . I did some searching on the web for a fix to the problem , and while others have complained about similar issues , I have not seen a responsive solution from Logitech or the forums . Thus , I have a keyboard that takes away my enjoyment of games , frustrates my work product , and appears to have no easy fix solution . If I could rate this less than one star , I would . For me , this K350 Keyboard\/Mouse Combo product is junk . The experience has been a complete waste of my time and money and I suspect that even though I uninstalled the keyboard software that came with the product , there is still some residue somewhere tainting my computer .

Let me start by saying it 's been 9 months since I 've got my Microsoft Arc Wireless Keyboard in white and I 'm still in love ! It 's one of the cutest , most stylish and affordable keyboards I 've ever came across with . I 'm a young female adult and was looking for a wireless keyboard that would match my minimalist pastel colored bedroom but would also feel sturdy enough to my daily usage and I 've sure found it . This keyboard is extremely compact and it 's white color just makes it easy on the eye while it sits on my desk . I 'm so happy I do n't need to hide my keyboard when not in use anymore and I can just keep it handy around my desk . I must say this pretty little thing takes a little bit of time to get used to it at first since it 's not a full sized keyboard with no numeric pad nor regular arrow keys . Also it is so thin that the keys actually feel a tad shallow when pressed compared to other keyboards . But I 've got used to the feel of it and I 'm quite glad now . Like another reviewer pointed it out its compact size also means that all keys could be reached virtually without moving your hands which is great for people with small hands in general . This was a huge plus to me as I am Brazilian and I 'm constantly toggling my keyboard idiom setting on windows back and forth between English and Portuguese-BR so the keyboard 's sleek form factor actually helped me memorizing quickly where all my Portuguese accents are even though they are `` not really there '' . No more ugly bilingual stickers for me ! Yay ! On the other hand , the keyboard was not as comfy to my boyfriend . I would n't recommend it to men , gamers and people with bigger hands unless style is a major concern . Like I said before , I 've got the white one and it does get sort of dirty after a while but I have been successfully wiping it back to its mint condition by simply using a regular rubber eraser . So far I have n't seen any yellowish stains that usually white appliances\/peripherals get after some time . At last but definitely not least this little beauty is a beast when it comes to battery performance ! The most I could ever get from 2AA batteries on every wireless keyboard I 've ever owned was 3 months of usage . Well it 's been 9 months using it everyday for about 6h\/day and I 'm still getting a solid performance on its 1st AA battery and I do n't think I 'm gonna have to change it in anytime soon .

"Using my laptop at home I found myself touching the cursor pad , and moving it around what I was typing . Also my old mouse was acting up , so I got this combo pack . It does and excellent job & I would recommend it to anyone . <ahref=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003VAGXZC/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/185-4065272-1018931""> Logitech Wireless Desktop MK320 with Keyboard and Mouse </a> "	Keyboard
The Ergo keyboard 4000 is a really terrific keyboard has three significant benefits over my last favorite keyboard , the MS Natural keyboard Pro . The first is the terrific riser in the front , creating a negative tilt . To create this tilt on the Pro , I had to elevate my wrists by using a piece of 2 by 4 cut to match the keyboard and then equipped with a wrist rest . The new Ergo has both the height and the rest set up perfectly . Note that if you have your keyboard set on a table or tray that is too high , this would be awkward . When the keyboard is set up properly -LRB- forearms parallel to the floor see site http:\/\/www.ergoindemand.com\/ergonomic-keyboarding.htm -RRB- , the Ergo is extremely kind to your wrists and the best I have EVER used . The lift can be removed but please try to use it , the negative tilt is a terrific ergo device . The second improvement is that the keys are much better . They take to edge hits much better than the old keyboard . There are also a lot less noisy than the Pro . -LRB- There is indeed a dead spot on the extreme upper corners of the space bar but I have NEVER noticed it - I have to contort my thumbs just to hit the spacebar like that and is a very unnatural -RRB- . The third improvement is the wealth of special keys , especially the favorites key and the F lock and num lock keys that remembers their settings . The favorites can start a program that you choose while the other silver keys can do commands -LRB- like copy , paste , and exit -RRB- . The back\/forward buttons I find pretty much useless as I have these set up on my mouse . The zoom key is used to change text size which works well for my old trifocal eyes . Negatives ? Pretty large keyboard , black , and the wrist rest is padded but not a cushy as my old gel one . This is the way keyboards should be made . 	Keyboard

i have a 13inch macbook pro and i purchased this to protect the keyboard , i feared that it was going to be cheaply made but let me just say IT IS NOT ! its thin and fits perfectly over the keys , it does not come up around the edges , and it feels more comfortable for my hands anyways since I 'm on the computer for extended periods of time , definitely recommend , you ca n't go wrong for the price !!!

I 'm using this on a Toshiba laptop , and it works as soon as the bluetooth wizard configures the device . The problem is , once I shut off the keyboard , I have to go through it all again . However , windows bluetooth manager shows the device is connected , but the keyboard does not even transmit a signal . At this point , I have to REMOVE the device from the listed devices , and re-install it . Then it works , just as before . But , I drive a limo and will use it to allow my customers to browse the web for tv and music video . And , thus , I need two . One for them , and one for me up front , in case something happens and I have to fix a problem . So , with the dongle that 's in the drawer , they both work fine , at the same time . The bluetooth dongle I had , got confused or something . But , I ca n't figure out why neither of them will function , even though they are connected , according to windows . That 's a bit of a hassle , having to re-install them , each time they are turned on . But , that 's most likely a system problem w\/my laptop and not with the device . I 've seen comments that the sensitivity of the pad is n't all that great , and I find it nearly equal to any mouse . A slight more effort , to get the cursor from one end of the screen to the other ... . If it were n't for having to re-install everytime I turn the unit back on , I would have ZERO complaints ... ; - -RRB- 	Keyboard
I got this keyboard mainly for one feature and the price . I have to say it 's priced well . As far as the keyboard goes , the keys feel good . It has a nice finish to it . The illumination is done very well . Aside from all that , it 's a pain to get used to . The button layout should be improved . I could n't get used to having a small right shift key and a small backspace . I knew all of this going into it , from looking at the pics and reading the reviews , but I decided to give it a chance anyway . The keyboard I received ended up being defective . The spacebar key did n't respond very well and ALL of the `` Multimedia '' keys were not working , except for the illumination button . Needless to say I gave up on this keyboard and returned it . You get what you pay for , save your money and get something more decent . Logitech makes a great slim illuminated keyboard . 	Keyboard
I wanted one of these keyboards ever since the first wave was released . I 'm really happy that I waited until now to buy this new keyboard . One of the things I was worried about was the key noise which is rather loud in the previous version of the keyboard -LRB- I tried a wired Wave before -RRB- but I gotta admit they worked that out really nicely ` cuz this keyboard is really quite . The keyboard is really comfortable and not just because of it 's wave design , but the keys 's size and the cushioned palm rest is soft enough for you to want to spend the rest of the day on it yet stiff enough to give your hands a nice grip . I really like the multimedia keys on the keyboard , I actually use most of them specially the 3 functions from F4-F6 that are open for you to place whatever you want . -LRB- One other thing I changed was the `` Launch Program '' key to launch Flip 3D instead of Logitech 's application switcher , just put this on the `` Program '' text field : '' % windir % \ System32 \ rundll32 . exe dwmapi . dll # 105 '' without the quotes . There are two things that I have to get used to : This keyboard splits the F keys into 4 groups of 3 instead of 3 groups of 4 . So I would automatically move my finger to the last key on the first group which would normally be F4 and find myself hitting the F3 key . Something else that I have to get used to is the disposition of the `` delete\/home\/end \/ pages up and down '' keys group , but that 's just something personal , I like the old form factor where all keys are the same size and you get 2 rows + 3 columns . Something I really do n't like about the keyboard is the fact that it has no on-keyboard indicators of any lock -LRB- not that I 'm missing the scroll lock one -RRB- and even though you get the on-screen indicator when you pressed the button , you have no way for knowing right way which state they 're in , even worse is the fact that you get no on-screen indicator when in the windows log-in screen , therefore knowing when you 're typings numbers is a trial and error process , really uncomfortable for passwords with numbers . Another thing I do n't like but I think with time I might used to ... is the placement of the context menu key , seems too far way , perhaps if it worked with only one key pressed I would n't mind the distance . I also love the fact that it comes with a Unifying Receiver -LRB- which was a key reason for my purchase -RRB- because I own , besides a Logitech Anywhere MX Mouse , a DELL XPS M1530 and these only come with 3 USB Ports ... so keyboard + mouse + phone charging = no free ports for the usb drive . Now I can use both mouse and keyboard using just one USB port . Overall this is an EXCELLENT keyboard with minor details and some things to get used to . 	Keyboard

This is an absolutely excellent product , and you just ca n't beat the price . In our conference room , the computer is back in a corner near the LCD projector . Unfortunately , that 's nowhere near the conference table where people sit . Previously , we had to jockey things around and avoid tripping over cables to make things work . <p> Now , you can sit anywhere in the room and control the PC . You can even pass the keyboard and mouse around . Goodbye cables ! And it was completely plug-and-play . Pop the INCLUDED batteries into the keyboard and mouse , plug the RF receiver into the keyboard and mouse ports on the PC , turn on the computer , and you 're up and running ! The hardest part was opening the sealed plastic packaging . <p> One other reviewer mentioned an inability to use the keyboard and mouse simultaneously because of channel conflicts . You can -- and should -- have the two run on different channels . It even says so in the documentation . Unfortunately , the default settings put both on the same channel , so you might have a problem unless you read the documentation first . <p> My only complaint with the product -- the only thing that kept me from giving it five stars -- was the size of the mouse . It 's a little wide and hard for people with small hands to use . But that 's nitpicking . <p> I 'm ordering one for home tonight ! 	Keyboard

I had owned one of these keyboards a few years ago and the keys started going bad . The price convinced me to order another , even though so many here said negative things about it . Suffice to say , it showed up , I plugged it in , almost half of the keys do n't work , right out of the box . Sent it back , lesson learned and ordered a Logitech Illuminated keyboard . Buyer beware on this Microsoft keyboard , they must have spilled coffee on the circuit board plans . 	Keyboard

Standard keyboard with wireless capability and great ilumination . The finish is great , have a transparent acrylic edge around . The keys are rounded in the corner and have a nice touch , not as good as the Razer Lycosa but very nice anyway . The big point here is the iluminating that is great , not dim like the Razer or even the G19 , both that I owned . The negative point here is the battery life , which is very short , I end using it cordeed all the time . Also it forget the light level and brings back it to lower all the time , I need to keep bringing it back to full which is kind of a nuisance . 	Keyboard
This is just about the coolest little keyboard you can find . It is light , portable , and it responds as well as a normal keyboard . The one downside , which I recently discovered , is that it wo n't work with the newer class of Palm Devices , explaining why it is so inexpensive now . When I first purchased a keyboard , it was to go along with a Zire 71 handheld . That handheld died , forcing me to upgrade to the newer Zire 72 . Much to my surprise , Palm changed the connection for their PDA 's , rendering the wonderful little typing device useless . So , if you are using one of the older models that it can work with , I would certainly say that it is a good buy . But , I would not count on it to last you for generations of Palm devices to come . 	Keyboard
I wanted something that would transmit more than ten feet - which was the limit of the Microsoft keyboard I had , but I ca n't get this Belkin to work under Windows XP due to driver issues . I have over ten years experience in Windows and Macintosh environments , and this device simply wo n't work with my system . Ultimately I bought a Logitech keyboard that gives me about fifteen feet in a direct line of sight with new batteries . 	Keyboard
The cable is only about 7 inches - not 2.3 feet . Works fine , even on Windows Vista . Just plug in and it installs . Cable needs its own port - it wo n't work if plugged into a USB hub . This is great if your new computer came without PS\/2 ports . 	Keyboard

Whenever I call for support , I get someone within 2 minutes . They speak English and they are helpful . . Problem is , I 'm calling just about everytime I want to watch tv or Netflix . I 'm not a techie so I need instructions on rebooting , switching cables , etc. . Yes , they have me switch the cables -LRB- same cables , different in\/out position -RRB- on a fairly regular basis . Can never plan to watch Netflix for sure . If customer service is closed -LRB- like tonight -RRB- and I turn on the tv and it is flakey , well , read a book until they are answering the phone again . Will be taking a hammer to it before long ! Great concept , just a lousy product . 	Keyboard

I absolutely love this keyboard and mouse . It was so easy to set up . Plug in the USB piece -LRB- it looks like a jumpdrive -RRB- and from there my computer read the new equipment . Then all I had to do was pull the tab piece from the battery compartments of the keyboard and the mouse and that was it . There is a power button on both so you can turn each one off individually or they automatically go into hibernation if not used for a few minutes . I love how responsive the mouse is and the fact that it has a back and forward button right on the mouse . The scroll button works super fast . The keyboard is very comfy . It has a display to tell you how much battery power it has left . The f-keys are preprogramed and have little icons on them to tell you what they can be used for . That is especially nice since before I have pretty much never used f-keys . There are also keys on the board for music -LRB- next , repeat , volume , ect -RRB- and I also love that . One other feature that I love the most is the button to pull up the calculator and its right on the keyboard . Maybe other keyboards have this feature , but my last one did not , so it is nice not having to go and find it or hunt for my handheld one when I am helping one of my kids with their math , or doing my own math . I really can not think of anything else that I would like added to either the mouse or keyboard . 	Keyboard
I bought this keyboard to complete a pc I built . It started to work fine but after a few minutes it started locking up and then missing keystrokes . I installed the latest drivers but still had the same problem . Running Vista Home Premium x64 . Sent it back . The keyboard feel is good but too unreliable for me . Maybe it is something about my environment that was the problem but I do n't have the time to waste to investigate it . 	Keyboard

I have an android Phone 2.1 but this keyboard is simply not working no this version of the phone . The keyboard works great and is quiet and works for me specially with my PC where I have a Belking bluetooth dongle . Was easy to pair to my pc and works perfect specially when i just want to have my arms on my chair rest without having to type with the big keyboard and the big keys , unfortunately it doesnt work on my android . The problem is when i run the application for the bluetooth keyboard to work , the application asking that you need to be connected on internet , which I do but the application just closes and stops thats it . I think is because of the version of the android is a bit older . I will try on a new version on another android phone and see if it works . Its a little tricky right there about the keyboard to work on your phone . You just have to open the Cd that comes with the keyboard and then you have to go to the android folder -LRB- in my case -RRB- and copy the application to your Sd card . After that go to File Manager and just run the application . The application will automatically installs and runs but in order to the application works you need to be connected to internet and that will be all you need . Hope this will help you . With other model phones oyu have to open the folder of your operating system and do pretty much same thing . For better guidelines open the Manual pdf on the cd . 	Keyboard
I 've used this mouse\/keyboard for a week now and could not be more satisfied . I use it approximately 25 feet from my laptop to watch Netflix on my big screen TV . The mouse was a little too sensitive so I reduced sensitivity via windows control panel settings . I do forget to shut the mouse power switch off at night , but it has not killed the battery yet . My son was so impressed with it that he took it home with him tonight ! I 'm ordering another . 	Keyboard
Highly advise against purchasing this item . i cant say how well it works , because for me it never did . tried everything , unit would not work . seems like logitech just selling lemons out the gate . customer service is a joke , they just appologize and offer no assistance . on top of that its been 2 weeks and they have yet to even give me an RMA so i can get my money back . Logitech is really going downhill in their quest for profit . avoid in the future . 	Keyboard
My girlfriend wanted this for her MacBook Pro . She purchased a pink case on Amazon as well and I thought she would like this one and she 's been wanting a keyboard cover . As soon as she got it , she loved right away . 	Keyboard
after having this keyboard included with my tablet PC , I started using it regularly in the office for the past couple of weeks -LRB- did n't use keyboard much first couple weeks -RRB- but was having intermittent issues with the connectivity\/syncing , not to mention the lag mentioned in previous reviews when it did work -LRB- I could have lived with that though -RRB- . I would get 1-3 days of functionality before it would just stop working ... I thought it was a computer\/software\/windows 7 issue so i would uninstall and re-install and it would work again for 1-3 days -LRB- 1.5 days was the average and yes i changed the batteries too -RRB- and after an excruciatingly long wait time with ASUS to get resolution -LRB- that 's another review ... -RRB- they said `` we 'll send an email with return instructions '' ... the email never came ... and the keyboard finally stopped working altogether -LRB- computer could no longer discover -RRB- when I called back They said the Microsoft 6000 keyboard was not covered in the warranty - it was one week Past 30 day coverage ... never again for the MSFT keyboard or ASUS for that matter ... poor product poor customer service .

Needed a mobile key board that I could roll up and use on remote site . The product worked great . Only downside is that it takes a while to learn how to do speed typing with it . 	Keyboard
I opened this up from its nice packaging and noticed when it was closed it felt a lot like a little net book . I was very happy initially , but when I went to open the clam shell the first thing I noticed was the lid seemed cheap and flimsy . I almost felt like I was breaking it when I open it , but it opens fine . I could sure see the plastic hinges breaking on this lid . The keyboard and bottom of the case was very nice , it felt sturdy , has some nice rubber feet on it to prevent sliding . The keys on the keyboard are raised enough that its easy to type on them , which is a plus . I used my new iPad 3rd gen and placed it in the lid and noticed right away again the lid is an issue , the iPad does not feel secure in it , and with the weight the keyboard semi lifts up off the ground like its to much back weight . This can be adjusted by sliding the back out further away from the base to compensate . In fact the whole lid itself that houses the ipad can come unattached from the base and you can move the keyboard wherever you want for ease of typing . The pairing process was easy , simply power on the keyboard , and press the connect button , go into the ipad bluetooth settings and select the keyboard , it then prompts you to enter an access code on the keyboard to connect and there you go . The keyboard has a an on and off switch and a lot of hot keys for the iPad , for instance one touch home screen , brightness , camera , virtual keyboard , search , and volume controls . These all worked well when tested . When folding the case up with the ipad in the lid , it does not quite feel closed all the way but close . Again this goes to the fact that my iPad does not feel safe and secure 100 % in this case . There are openings in the lid where they need to be for the camera , and speakers so nothing is obstructed when in the case . The lid does a unique swivel so you can have the iPad vertical or horizontal which is nice . Overall the case works , I only give it four stars because the lid needs some work , it just feels cheap , does n't house the ipad securely enough for me , and is so light with the added iPad weight it kind of throws the whole thing out of balance unless you adjust it just right . I just want a little more out of the lid and the secureness of my iPad investment . Everything else works great , and its a unique design that works . I like how it feels like a netbook when sealed up also . I 've carried a netbook around for years and this just feels right . For the price this is a good keyboard for your iPad compared to others out there costing a lot more . I think the top two to beat are the Zag Folio , and the Kensington ones , but those are a little more pricey . If you want to stay under the $ 60 mark and have a nice keyboard combo this works .

Not only does this have the OVERHEATING and NOT BEING TRANSPARENT issues but it ripped right out of the box . it was folded , so when i tried to unfold it , it just ripped . do n't . get . this . 	Keyboard
I bought this because I Thought it would be nice to use on my media PC because it was the size of a remote control . First thing I notice is that the laser pointed does not work at all . Advertised that it had one . I do n't need it but if you tell me it is going to have one I expect it to work . That was the first clue about the quality of this . Then I use the keyboard after fully charging it and with direct line of sight this would not work right to keyboard or mouse . Combine that with the small mouse pad and keyboard and you have to get up and point the device to get it to go more than 10ft away . End of story I returned this crap quality device for a small logitech K400 unit a bit larger with full size keyboard and trackpad built in . It works perfectly from around 20 feet away -LRB- all I tested -RRB- and the device works perfectly with my Mac Pro , Linux box , Mac Mini , and Gateway laptop . Great handy keyboard to have laying around . Just pop the usb dongle in and both mouse and keyboard fire up . This mini piece of junk I had to return . 	Keyboard
This cover was n't a great fit for my keyboard , but it does stay put once you 've typed on it a bit . It took awhile to get used to , but now that I am , it really has sped up my typing and protects my keys from getting dirty . It 's easy to pop it off and clean it , but then of course it is weird to fit it back on . However , I tried typing without it the other day , and it was a very odd feeling , so I guess I 've gotten used to it . The main reason I feel it speeds up typing is because your fingers wo n't slide around the keys , and with the extra friction you do n't have to be as precise . The reason for my rating of 3 is that the blue is CONSIDERABLY lighter than it appears in this picture - much closer to sky blue than to true blue . I would have returned it but did n't want to deal with the hassle . 	Keyboard
Easy to install . Easy to use . I have n't had any issues . If you 're looking for an ergonomic keyboard this is a good choice . 	Keyboard
I selected this product because I am a fan of Logitech Keyboards and Mice . I paid $ 79.00 for a similar product almost five years ago and was very happy with the quality and value of the product . At $ 39.99 , I was willing to take a chance on this product due to my past experience with Logitech products . I am not disappointed at all with this combo . The keyboard is solid and has good `` feel '' , not cheap or noisy . The laser mouse is very fast and accurate . So fast , that I had to adjust the tracking speed down from my former optical mouse . I had to turn The receiver for this combo is very , very , small . It 's so small it comes with a label and plastic attached so that you do n't lose it while unpacking . It can be placed in the front port of your desktop , or can be left in a side port of your laptop . All in all , a very good deal , the quality and value was as I expected , and it even came with batteries for both . 	Keyboard
Ho can you lose here ? It adds a bit of clunk to typing and if you type for a living at 90 words a minute . . well save your $ 2.78 . . If , like me , you sneeze , and accidently spill things once in a while . . its great insurance . Try it . . -LRB- Update -RRB- A few times I have looked down at my keyboard cover and found `` dried foreign stain material '' . Thank goodness I had the cover ! Cleans up with dish soap . It does kill the back-lighting for the keyboard . I just pull it off when working in the dark . If you want to use it in a professional situation involving a darkened room , forget about it . Well . . again we 're talking $ 3 here ... 	Keyboard

Okay the keyboard is overall fantastic . Types like a dream as far as comfort and speed . The additional macro buttons and function keys are a big help as well . HOWEVER , and this is a big however , I have had a TERRIBLE experience so far with Razer 's quality control as far as these boards are concerned . About a week ago the -LRB- Left Ctrl -RRB- key on my several day old Razer Blackwidow -LRB- the standard edition , not the ultimate -RRB- just stopped working , with no explanation whatsoever , so I swapped it out for an old Lycosa which I had been using before while I waited for my replacement to arrive -LRB- decided to upgrade to an ultimate from the standard because I wanted a backlight to help me type in the dark when I game at night -RRB- . So my new board arrives , and I discover shortly after unboxing it that it has a second -LRB- T -RRB- key where the -LRB- Y -RRB- key should be ... Keep in mind that this the second issue I have had in less than a week , with their highest quality board , no less . LONG STORY SHORT , GREAT BOARD , BUT BE READY IF RAZER 'S QUALITY CONTROL SCREWS YOU OVER ! 	Keyboard
Easy to set up , easy to use . Plug in adapter , remove protective film from mouse & keyboard . That 's it . Install software to access additional functions . As a touch typist , I was concerned about adjusting to the different keyboard style , but it has taken me all of 15 seconds . Sweet . Love the mouse , too , although it will take some tweaking of the settings before I stop overshooting the mark . The USB adapter is so tiny that I nearly did n't find it hiding up in the top , left corner of the box . Have used and been happy with Logitech in the past , and I can see this will be no exception . 	Keyboard
Bought this for my home theater PC , running Linux . The size , weight , keyboard layout , typing feel , and battery life are all great . It 's well balanced in the hands , and I can easily type one-handed while standing up , say , for entering a username and password while browsing the web . The wireless sensitivity appears to work as advertised , having used it at distances well over 20 ' from my computer . There is a `` left '' mouse button on the front right of the keyboard , so you can use just your right hand for pointing and clicking , unless you need to use the `` right '' mouse button . Then you have to use your left hand to operate the mouse buttons on the left side of the keyboard . These left-side mouse buttons take a little getting used to , since my brain is wired to operate mouse buttons with only my right hand . But after a day or two of use these left-side buttons feel naturally placed . I 've also come to rely heavily on the the scroll wheel on the front left of the keyboard . The Home\/End\/PgUp \/ PgDown keys are conveniently positioned in the right-most column of keys right next to the trackball , making for easy page navigation during web browsing , PDF reading , etc. . Unfortunately , IOGear has not improved the trackball design from previous models , which others have complained about in Amazon reviews . Out of the box , it felt gritty and rough . This has smoothed out somewhat over time , but is still far from perfect . It also wobbles in its socket , which makes for a wholly unsatisfying experience and reduces accuracy . I use a Logitech Marble Mouse with my office computer , which is so smooth and accurate that it makes the IOGear trackball seem like an afterthought . If only IOGear would improve this one critical part , the keyboard would be the perfect addition to our home entertainment system . That said , I enjoy using the keyboard , and have come to live with the trackball . I still think it 's a better setup than balancing a separate keyboard and pointer device when sitting on a couch . The keyboard comes with rechargeable AA batteries and USB cable for recharging , which is a nice touch . 	Keyboard
Tried with debian : no software needed , most fn keys recognized by gnome without problem -LRB- music\/media player key is mapped to tools -RRB- . The back and forward key are quite useful for browsing . The keyboard feels a little smaller than regular keyboard , but feels quite comfortable typing . I use vim quite often recently and the smaller keyboard makes it easy to reach the ESC key . The only complain I have for this combo is the mouse . I know it 's a simple mouse -LRB- without fast scroll and extra buttons -RRB- , but I did n't expect to feel friction when scrolling the wheel and even hear noise . It also does n't support left\/right scroll . 	Keyboard
This is great keyboard . Works well and has a decent range . I 'm using the keyboard with ubuntu . It fired right up . Logitech does not support Ubntu so do n't expect all the bells and whistles . The only thing that is missing is the ability to tilt up . A feature that comes on just about every keyboard no matter how cheap . 	Keyboard
It 's been an hour now and blue tooth is still searching for devices , followed directions to the letter . Device is faulty crap . Do n't waste your money . 	Keyboard
Out of the box , several keys were not attached to the keyboard , but floating around inside . I tried to press them back into place and was mostly successful . The Q key kept coming off . Good aspects , small , light weight , keyboard is easily detachable adding more options for positioning , company responded to my complaint , by authorizing return . Cons : NO communication from company . thought they might want to make good on their product , but they just quietly sent a return label . final analysis , try it but YMMV . At least if you are not happy you can get a return and full credit . If you get one that works , it would be a cool gadget to have . I wound up with one from Brookstone Hard to find tools , a bit more money but very strongly built . keyboard does not detach from this one , but they do sell a soft keyboard that you can get separately for such a need .

Never got it and I ordered it over a month ago . Do n't waste your time . Even though it 's cheap its so not worth it . 	Keyboard
This is an amazing keyboard . An excellent look and quiet keys . Some reviewers said keys wore off and I have had this product for about a month with heavy use -LRB- I work from home so it sees 10 - 14 hours of use per day , plus gaming -RRB- and I have had no issues . Even if a couple keys wear off I will still love this keyboard . The red glow is perfect for playing games in a dark room , it is not distracting at all . If you are looking for an impressively working and looking keyboard look no further . 	Keyboard
I own five of these - does that say enough ? First of all I am going to come right out and say that I completely do n't understand the number of 1 and 2 star reviews . I hate to refer to someone as a moron based on their review of a keyboard , but in this case , it 's entirely difficult not to . I find myself asking `` What is wrong with these people ? '' a lot while reading the negative reviews . That said , I notice that a lot of the negative reviews were written by programmers , and perhaps their needs are different than mine . I 've spent the better part of the last 15 years of my life in front of a computer . I find that entirely depressing for the most part , but it 's true . For many years I was an enthusiast , and then I spent 5 years as a computer repair guy in a local computer shop , after which I moved onto a job in the web hosting industry and spent 5 years mixed between tech support and management . I started using this keyboard during the management phase of my time at the web hosting company , and ... wow . It really made a huge difference in my comfort level sitting at the desk . I had begun to develop a bit of carpel tunnel , tingling in my wrist and fingers , etc ; after buying this keyboard , it all went away . I 'm not suggesting that will be everyone 's experience , just that it is my own . I 've owned a whole lot of keyboards , and this is easily the best that I 've ever used . It 's rock solid , has perfectly sized keys and a nice , soft wrist rest built-in . A lot of these programmer types in the negative reviews have complained about the space bar being hard to strike , but that 's not my experience ; in my time with this keyboard , it 's been a breeze . I almost never use the short-cut keys at the top ; just never got in the habit . They work , though , for the record . At the beginning of this review I stated that I own 5 of these keyboards . I should add that I have also bought these for many people that I know , and they have all adjusted to it quite well and love it . No one I know first-hand has ever had any issue with it . 	Keyboard
As funny as the box may look it contains a keyboard that makes a keyboard-screen typist like me happy . I type using a version of true touch typing and flicking my eyes between the keyboard and the screen . This is because I started as a hunt and peck typist . You have to have a bright keyboard to type fast when using this method . This works ! 	Keyboard
Got here quicker than the estimated time , it fits my white macbook nicely -LRB- 13 inch -RRB- , feels nice to the touch , and it prevents a bunch of crap from getting inside the keys . What more do you need ? 	Keyboard
"I picked this set up because I wanted a second one of the keyboard -LRB- which I love , see my review <ahref=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002MMY4WY/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/177-6939039-4298636""> Logitech K350 2.4 Ghz Wireless Keyboard </a> -RRB- , and figured the mouse was a bonus . ... Not . The mouse is full-sized and full-featured . Very flexible with the software as far as reprogramming the buttons . However , there are two features of this mouse that will cause me to either put it in a drawer for emergency replacements or just give it away . 1 . The scroll wheel : I have two other Logitech mice that I use most of the time : an MX Revolution and a Darkfield Performance MX . Both have VERY fast scroll wheels . Once you get used to that , you never want to go back . This mouse is PAINFULLY slow in comparison , and , although via the software you can reprogram it to two other scroll modes , both require moving the mouse on the desktop rather than just moving the scroll wheel . 2 . This is the real deal-breaker : The finish on the top of the mouse is gritty and irritates my palm . I used this mouse for about 4 hours , doing normal `` stuff . '' My right hand was back and forth between the keyboard and the mouse , but mostly I was clicking around the web and my system . At the end of the time , the palm of my hand , in the quadrant under my pinky and toward the heel , was irritated . I could n't figure out why . Then I compared the finish on the M510 to my other two and realized that the others are MUCH smoother . I checked my husband 's stash of sandpaper , and I would say that the M510 has a finish on the top that is just a bit smoother that 600 grit wet or dry sandpaper . Apparently I do n't settle my hand all the way down on the body of the mouse all the time . Part of my hand hovers just high enough that it `` brushes '' over the surface of the mouse . I never realized that before , but now that I know , I 'll never buy a mouse without a smooth top surface again . If your mousing technique is different from mine , this could be a great mouse for you , but not for me . "	Keyboard
Great keyboard , even ordered a second one for another desktop . I am not a gamer and these keyboards were bought so I could see what I was typing without having loads of light or night time working so for me the keyboard is comfortable , the keys have a good touch and I like the choice of the 3 colors of light , -LRB- blue-default , red , and purple , the red and purple are actually a little brighter -RRB- . all in all a good keyboard and the one I have had for well over a year without issue and the keyboard is used daily for several hours per day\/night .

Do yourself a favor and save yourself the 90 + dollars . This thing is a flimsy , cheap plastic piece of junk that relies on the pressure of two plastic pieces , compressed together to keep itself attached to your chair . I was very excited to try this out , since I renovated my office a bit and removed my formal desk , and now needed a place to rest my KBD and mouse . Talk about depressing . The box it comes in has better production value . First , the keyboard tray is completely separate from the rest of the mounted items , so at any second the thing is bumped , jiggled , or downright falls off during normal movements . Not to mention it is literally a black piece of plastic no better or bigger than the smallest , cheapest cutting board you could buy for your kitchen . Next , the armrest mounts , when mounted evenly have a little piece that fits inside in order to adjust for the curve of your chairs armrests . This piece will fall out with hardly any provocation . Also , the brackets that hold the front and back in place are done so with screws - that 's right - it 's not like they are adjustable , smooth pieces that snap into place like you would expect - you literally have to take these small rough edge brackets and screw them into the bottom of the armrest covers . And because you 're simply holding them in place with pressure - guess what - any bump against the back of the armrest cover and the whole thing slides forward dumping everything in the floor . Oh and did I mention that if you use this on a chair with a wood frame you just scratched the hell out of the wood ? Yea - you do . Additionally , the armrest sit in so far that unless you have a super-sized chair base , or are anorexic , you can expect to not be able to spread out , or sit as comfortably as you like , or on some chairs , literally have this thing dig into you . I could see where your basic , run of the mill , 30 dollar office chair with a short back and tiny armrests would probably do ok with this thing -LRB- but then , why would you need it since you 'd probably have a desk to go with that kind of chair -RRB- , but for 90 dollars - I mean really - 90 bucks ?? - you 'd be better off getting one of those laptop stations with the beanbag bottom that fits in your lap for half the price . I literally put this thing on three different chairs , tested each one for a full hour or so of normal operation , and threw it back in the box . Mobo should be ashamed of themselves for putting such a price tag of this crap . This is not worth it , but spend your money how you want . 	Keyboard
While the case secures the laptop nicely and looks well built the integrated keyboard failed within a week of purchase with less than 2 hours use . 	Keyboard
There were not instructions . After messing around with it , I figured out to press the FN+ALT +0 to get it to connect -LRB- blue light comes on -RRB- . It works on my Ipad -LRB- 1 -RRB- , but refuses to connect to my Ipod -LRB- 2nd gen -RRB- . It 's light weight and small , but cheaply made . For the price , I can not complain . However , for a few more bucks I was probably better off with a better model . 	Keyboard
I love everything about this keyboard except for ONE problem when i 'm typing , at anormal speed , it types a million of eaaaaach letter , like this , i did n't od that with the a 's in each , the keyboard did . its really annoying , especially when it also goes for the backspace . Meaning that if I was at the end of `` each '' and wanted to fix those a 's i would press backspace and my enitRE sentence would be deleted . besides THAT its great its also constantly behind , by like a full second 	Keyboard
For the 2 months that it worked , it was better than other mini keyboard\/trackball combos that I 've tried -LRB- but that is not saying much at all , since they are almost all terrible -RRB- . One thing I liked most about this over others was that it rarely needed to be resynched . The trackball worked pretty well for being so tiny , and the mouse buttons\/scroll wheel were nice . But today , after using the keyboard for probably only 5-15 minutes per week over the last couple of months , it has gone haywire . Pressing most keys on the keyboard now results in the keyboard sending multiple keystrokes to the computer . For example , the `` g '' key sends `` gv '' . I 'm past the Amazon 30-day guarantee , so I 'll have to try to deal with the manufacturer Adesso . 	Keyboard
I have been using this particular model of keyboard for awhile The reason I bought a new one was that my other one finally stopped working after almost daily use for over 10 years . The keyboard outlasted four different computers and 3 different operating systems . I do not need or use the multimedia buttons you see on newer versions of this type of keyboard because I do not use them anyway and there is less risk of pressing the wrong key . Also with the included USB adapter I can use this keyboard with either PS\/2 or USB ports on the computer offering more flexibility . I also like the heavier buttons and the distinctive clicking sound that is made when typing . Computer users with big hands would like this keyboard because of the added support it provides especially if you type a lot . 	Keyboard
This is an AWESOME deal at $ 99.00 . Basically turns your TV into an internet surfing device . Google Chrome is on there and I use it more there than on any other computer at home . Netflix works great , Pandora and Internet video podcast queueing . I subscribe to a number of video podcasts and it is great to watch them in HD right from the device . I heard lots of complaints about hooking it up and getting started , but it was easier than my last Bluray player . 	Keyboard
We purchased this for my son for his netbook , just incase his large hands could n't work the smaller keyboard on his netbook . However he uses it for his xbox . He is completely pleased with it .

I read comments and reviews before I purchased this item thinking it would be a perfect fit for my macpro 13 ' . Unfortunately when I layed it on my keyboard it was stretched out and a bit bit . Every time I would type . . I had to re-adjust the silicon cover . Although the delivery was on time and really well done . 	Keyboard
This keyboard works great right of the box , and most importantly , all the keys are full size and IN THE RIGHT PLACE . Love that it has an off switch , since it is only used intermittently . 	Keyboard

First let me just say that I am not a big fan of Razer products -LRB- still not a big fan -RRB- and are aware of their keyboard life expectancy . I was torn between a Blackwidow and a Steelseries 6gv2 and ultimately went with the Blackwidow for it 's macro keys . Unlike most rumors about this keyboard , I can tell you this keyboard is as durable as any blue keys mechanical keyboards could be . The key switches themselves are very comfortable to type on and as someone who spends the majority of his days on his computer , I can tell you that typing have never felt more comfortable . The clicking noise can be seen as a good or bad . This keyboard makes ALOT of noise when typing . I myself am a fan of it but if you live with a roommate you may want to avoid this keyboard . The keyboard itself contains 5 easily customizable macro keys that are easily reachable during gaming . The keys themselves uses blue switches . Compared to black , they are less durable or weaker but much more comfortable to type on and clicks the moment you type on it opposed to black switches which requires you to push all the way down for the click . The keyboard itself also can only be attached via USB meaning it is limited to a 2 NKRO -LRB- key rollover -RRB- meaning it can only perform 2 keys functions at one time although keep in mind that you would rarely need more than 2 since you ussualy play with a mouse as well . Overall this is a great product and despite Razer 's keyboard record , this keyboard is a good buy . This keyboard however is mediocre compared to other hardcore gaming mechanical keyboards but if this is your first mechanical keyboard then this would be the perfect one to get . UPDATE : Interestingly enough , several of the keys on my keyboard stoped functioning a day after I wrote how amazing this keyboard was and I 've only had it for 2 weeks . Those interested in this purchase be warned that some keys may stop working after long periods of gaming . 	Keyboard
This thing took a bit of getting used to , but the only flaws I can find is the placement of the single space key under the right thumb and the inability to adjust the angles on the keypads . I 'd rather have a second space key under the left thumb and move the backspace key someplace else , and be able to adjust the distance from each other and angle to each other of the two keypads . Still , after just a few days , the weird , chronic pain in my elbows and forearms is beginning to dissipate - which did n't happen with the cheaper keyboards I have purchased over the years -- and the keyboard is beginning to feel incredibly natural .

i needed an external keyboard that I could use while traveling . The big keyboards do not fit in my computer case , and I could not find a bag large enough to carry everything comfortably . This 15 '' keyboard is able to fold in half or even roll up . The only difficulty with the product is that it truly has quiet keys ... which can be hard to get used to . Also , the key placement is a bit tricky , and for advanced windows users who use the keyboard shortcuts , sometimes it is better to reach over and use the laptop keyboard . 	Keyboard
This keyboard is inexpensive and very pleasant to use . I plug it into my macbook to enhance comfort while typing . Highly recommended ! 	Keyboard
Because of brief experiences with Microsoft ergonomic keyboards , I intended to order the cordless ITouch -LRB- nonergonomic -RRB- instead of this ; however this was the only one in stock and I ended up getting this one ... The keyboard is really nice . As another reviewer mentioned , the slope of the keys feel much more natural than the microsoft . However , I have to disagree with the previous reviewer about the layout of the home\/end\/etc keys . If the keys have to be in a vertical layout , this layout makes much more sense than the microsoft 's - microsoft arranged the keys in a seemingly random order , while logitech left most of the keys in their standard place . . -LRB- insert\/delete and page up\/down are where you 'd expect -RRB- The cordless mouse is also far superior to microsoft 's - the movement is much smoother and more responsive . I had to take off one star for 1 -RRB- the `` logitech '' key seems to randomly think it 's pressed once in awhile and pops up an annoying help page ; 2 -RRB- when i play some games , in order to get a decent response time from the keyboard i always have to press the `` connnect '' button after every reboot both of these problems are probably driver\/software problems , but they 're annoying 	Keyboard
The keyboard works excellent all around , the only thing you should be aware of is that some of the non word keys are closer to the words than normal keyboards are 	Keyboard
I bought this keyboard to use in my kindergarten classroom . While I do n't use it everyday , it has been a great addition to my routine . The sound quality is clear , and the voices , for the most part , are some of the most authentic I 've heard on any electric piano . I love the pre-recorded songs , which are intended as lessons - I have my students sing along to the familiar ones . 	Keyboard
First I preface by saying I 've had PCs since the 80s . This is the first keyboard I ever used that wo n't work correctly . It refuses to be recogized by my Win 7 64bit one-year old system even after a full BIOS update . To operate the keyboard I have to manually unplug it and then plug it back in . Tech support wants me to change BIOS settings ... something I 've never done for ANY keyboard . What 's up with that ?? The Logitech boards are also peppered with problem stories about this product . Needless to say , this one goes on the shelf -LRB- had it too long to return it -RRB- and the trusty Microsoft keyboard comes out of retirement . 	Keyboard
I will keep this review short . . !!! Setting the expectations right . . !!! 1 -RRB- This is a $ 100 product so do not expect it to work like a $ 600 computer . The expectations are not aligned . 2 -RRB- If you try to use it as as $ 600 computer , it will slow down and crash . Setup : 1 . 6 Mbps Internet , Revue is setup to connect to wifi Pros : - 1 -RRB- Streams Netflix , Youtube , Crackle , Pandora , Radio and many many channels . 2 -RRB- Android Market has tons of application to install and use . 3 -RRB- Google chrome browser is inbuilt . 4 -RRB- Can stream any video or movie or online channels that can be streamed on your computer . -LRB- some may not work but that is expected -RRB- 5 -RRB- I can search for a free movie online streaming on chrome and click on a link to stream it on my revue and it works perfectly . 6 -RRB- DLNA compatible . which means my laptop folders -LRB- windows 7 -RRB- are shared with revue and I can stream any thing on the revue from my laptop without any performance degradation on the laptop . This means , I stream a movie from my laptop on to revue and still work on the laptop . -LRB- Is n't it amazing ? . . -RRB- 7 -RRB- Keyboard is just amazing . Good range , good functionality and good integration . I can control my TV , revue and speakers with the keyboard . Do not have to deal with multiple remotes . Cons : The only thing I do not like is the update cycle . Flash player is still not updated due to which some apps are broken . I am really happy with the device . For the price I paid , I can not expect more from the device . At times , the streaming stops and you just have to start the video , big deal . I am fine doing it as I do not expect it to work as $ 600 computer . 	Keyboard
Compact and functional . Small is what I was looking for and the multimedia keys at the top are perfect for the MAME machine\/digital jukebox I will be running it on . Has dedicated Ctrl\/Alt\/Del key and Windows key . A little awkward because of small size , but all-in-all I like it . Micro USB dongle was located in a storage compartment between the battery slots . Had to check the manual to see where it was stored as it was so small it did n't stand out when I installed the batteries . Drivers were automatically installed by Windows XP . No issues so far . 	Keyboard
Title says it all . The keys on the keyboard feel extremely good . They give off a satisfying `` click '' -LRB- perhaps that 's not the best word to describe the sound -RRB- when they 're pushed . Some people might not like the noise . But I do . The mouse is also pretty good . I prefer my mouses to be `` thicker '' though . 	Keyboard
I purchased this keyboard looking for a cheap wireless keyboard and touchpad combo . At a distance of around 12-15 feet the responses are ify . Within range the device works well except for the most annoying thing about it . The device refreshes every 30 seconds or so and this is especially irritating when trying to watch a movie . It will also slightly move the cursor from time to time which makes it worse . Sometimes you get what you pay for . 	Keyboard
We were looking around for a wireless keyboard and mouse . When I came across this and read the reviews , we decided to purchase it . It was a great price to have a keyboard and mouse together in one package . Has worked very well ! 	Keyboard
I like the feel of this , its a nice keyboard . But do n't flex it when in operation . It does n't operate well when it is bent . Use it on a flat surface . The manual says not to roll it up tightly when you store it away . There are many small wires inside that may be damaged if stressed too far . A problem , this keyboard disabled my PS\/2 mouse port . I had to buy a USB mouse to run with this keyboard . 	Keyboard
I bought this keyboard about two weeks ago . I had so many problems with it during that time that I finally gave up and returned it for refund . This is the first Logitech equipment that I 've ever had so many problems with . In my home we have six keyboards altogether -LRB- some of them actively used , others on a shelf -RRB- . Of our six keyboards , five of them are Logitech keyboards . As I type this review , I am using a Logitech keyboard , an `` old-fashioned '' corded keyboard with the keys in a straight line -LRB- with an `` old-fashioned '' Logitech corded mouse -RRB- . \*\* It works better than the keyboard that is the subject of this review . \*\* The initial , original , starting installation of the WAVE keyboard and accompanying mouse took HOURS ! The software -LRB- `` Setpoint '' -RRB- is probably very sophisticated -LRB- 24 Megs ? I should hope so ! -RRB- but I 'll never know for sure . I got it running and I could use the keyboard and the mouse , but the full installation of the latest revision of the Setpoint software was never accomplished . So I tried to update the program . The Logitech website insisted on presenting their 64-bit update no matter how many times I checked off the 32-bit update choice . Then , clicking on the DOWNLOAD button on Logitech 's site produced nothing . No response . Zero . Zip . Then I went to another download site -LRB- `` Hippo '' -RRB- and downloaded the proper update . Then I attempted to install it and finally succeeded after several tries . Then I tried to run Setpoint . It refused to run , stating that an `` essential '' file `` khalwraper . dll '' was corrupted AND THEREFORE THE INSTALL COULD NOT CONTINUE . I did a search on the net and learned that `` khalwraper . dll '' is a virus of some kind , affecting the registry . Then I used another program to clean my registry . Setpoint still would n't run , again making the statement that that essential file `` khalwraper . dll '' was corrupted . Then I called customer service . I spent a lot of time in discussion , and I mentioned and named and slowly spelled out the letters of the offending file , `` khalwraper . dll . '' The technician instructed me to uninstall Setpoint , using the Windows Control Panel Option to do so . I did , and that is when I finally lost my patience ! The uninstallation of Setpoint left me with no mouse at all ! -LRB- Have you ever tried to run Windows without a mouse , using keyboard commands only ... ? -RRB- After a lot of wasted time , I managed to shut down the computer , pull out all the Logitech Wave components and replace those components with this old-fashioned , non-wireless , non-ergonomic dinosaur . This old dinosaur works , at least . I packed up the Wave , returned it to Amazon for refund . Now I 'll try to upgrade my dinosaur . Again . Some words of warning about ` ergonomic ' : The word , `` ergonomic '' does n't have a consistent meaning when used to describe keyboards , in my opinion . I found that the most common meaning of `` ergonomic '' in this context was a keyboard that was flat -LRB- that is , no \* wave \* in the height of the keys -RRB- but with a curve to the keys ' layout , a convex curve from the typist 's viewpoint . The word , `` ergonomic keyboard '' sometimes excludes the so-called `` split '' keyboard in which the keyboard keys are separated into two non-curved halves , one for left hand , one for right hand . Sometimes these halves are on the same chassis , sometimes not . Be careful when choosing an `` ergonomic '' keyboard and\/or mouse . What you need and what you actually buy may not `` match . '' Some words of warning about wireless keyboards\/mice : If you wish to upgrade your keyboard and\/or mouse , think carefully about what you want to change and why . If you use a desktop computer and only a desktop computer , think carefully about your need for wireless devices . How could using a wireless keyboard enhance your work on your desktop computer ? Do you really need the freedom to move the keyboard all over the room ? What 's the point ? On the other hand , a wireless mouse \*\* might \*\* be useful if your corded mouse gets its tail tangled in the paperwork or other debris on your desk . Think carefully ! Maybe a corded keyboard with a cordless mouse is the answer . Do n't go wireless unless you must ! For those of you who use a laptop computer in a desktop environment , your needs are different . Think carefully . Decide . And when you have , look around and buy \*\* exactly \*\* what you need , no less , and \*\* no more . \*\* If you ca n't find wireless devices which meet your needs , look harder ! Corded devices are available ! And , in the long run , I do recommend Logitech . 	Keyboard
I needed a small keyboard . This one is small and affordable . It 's kind of annoying to use though . Maybe it 's not fair to complain about it - since it 's serving a purpose -LRB- being small -RRB- - but my general impression of the keyboard is not favorable . 	Keyboard
This keyboard is very nice and works well . We were able to get about 38 feet from dongle before we lost signal . Design is nice . key are large enough for a compact design . 	Keyboard
First and foremost , The Electronic Bible came promptly at 12:30 pm est -LRB- is still daylight savings time -RRB- 09.21.2010 . The box mildly damaged but the unit was in `` Class A '' condition . I did n't know it was audio but I am so glad ! And the instructions ; after about fifteen minutes of reading I was able to find the bible passages for next Sunday 's service in no time . Thank goodness it is a QWERTY keyboard . My right hand is down for the count but being a former touch typist . I 'm not having any problems working the buttons . My only complain is the ear buds . They wo n't stay in `` my '' ears so I 'm using a spare of ear buds that have soft tips . Mine you , I 'm talking about my ears so do n't get concerned . You unit is just what I needed . Thank you 	Keyboard
This is a terrific accessory for the original iPad if you find yourself typing to any extent on the iPad screen . The best addition ? Arrow keys ! Part of what makes it so terrfic is that you can use in either portrait or landscape orientation . I 've used the keyboard that allow only portrait and they are bad for email . It 's an OK case , where you fold the stand element down and place the iPad screen-down into the unit . It 's very secure and does not scratch the screen , it can be a little tricky to remove and I 've been thinking about adhering a small tab of some kind to the edge of my ` pad to make it easier . I liked this product so much I 'm buying one for my elder father . 	Keyboard
First , I agree completely with all the positive reviews , especially the two extensive , detailed reviews on the main page -- bravo to the writers . I 've been using Logitech products almost exclusively since the company made its first mouse . At present , I have five mice , three keyboards and a webcam . The only real dud was a scanner , but no one 's perfect . In general , Logitech products are superior to their competitors , especially Microsoft 's . My new K350 replaced a less-than-two year old MS keyboard which was prone to keys not working when they felt like it and had the keyboard handling equivalent of a Mack truck . The K350 was a delight right out of the box , for all the reasons given by the other reviewers . I do have two cavils : 1-I like a keyboard with a scroll-wheel on the left side of the deck so I can use both mouse and keyboard interchangeably . Granted , no one makes them anymore -- I had two made by MS and one by Logitech . I bought the K350 because the user 's quide was vague about reprogramming the Zoom key - it even fooled the salesman , who also checked the Logitech website . It took e-mails and calls to Logitech to find out it was n't possible . -LRB- At least , Logitech does provide extensive Customer Support , without charge . Try to get help from the `` other big guy . '' -RRB- The keyboard would be enhanced by making the Zoom key programmable like all those other keys and the Users Guide more information-oriented and less-PR . 2-I have had recent durability issues with some of the mice -- my MX Revolution failed and was replaced three times , all under Logitech 's excellent warranty . Logitech needs to look at the reliability of their Chinese fabricators to make a product that is as excellent in durability as it is in design concept . I would like to believe that this keyboard is not going to need replacing in the near-future . All that said , I still prefer Logitech products and would recommend them with almost no hesitation . Alas , ten months after purchase , the keyboard started throwing off anomalous key-strokes and refusals to register key-strokes . It took several calls to Logitech , where I was told to remove the batteries and punch some keys several times . This was a temporary fix -- and how many times should a person have to stop productive work to play with his keyboard ? Finally , Logitech recognized -- whatever it is they recognize -- and replaced the keyboard under warranty . 	Keyboard
This is a wonderful keyboard for the money . I can type much faster on the ipad than using the touch screen . It takes time to adjust to the keys since return is a bit off from a regular keyboard . 	Keyboard
I bought one of these at a local store to use with my Dell computer , but it does not work . The old keyboard I wanted to use is not recognized by the computer . 	Keyboard
the material is fantastic , and the visibility through it is great , too . however , this is likely designed for a 13 or 14 inch laptop , because my laptop is a 15.6 inch one , and it does n't reach across the entire keyboard . if they made a larger one , i would definitely order one again to have it cover the entire thing . a negative point is that if you do n't be careful the first time putting it on , it will get a little smudgy . does n't make a difference with clarity , though . another great point is that if it 's really bad , you can take it off and rinse it , or wipe it off , depending on what 's on it .

This is great for work . Keyboard and mouse were a snap to install . worked like a charm in a couple of minutes . All hot-keys work well for the Web . I can get rid of my `` wired '' remote control for my speakers . This is a great buy for anyone considering it . Worth every penny and good quality . Easy to use !! 	Keyboard
Love the weight of the keys . It 's a sleek , basic look . Owned the product for three weeks . Mouse is a little bulkier than I 'd like and scroll is n't as smooth as most mouses . Perfect for my needs and budget 	Keyboard
This is a new and potentially great product . The industry wonders why Apple does so well . That is not that they have not done the same in many of their product failures . 1 . Why not put in a super quiet fan - this one is noisy side . Probably saved 25 cents at OEM cost . 2 . Should have used the fastest Atom processor - you are trying to impress with a new launch . This processor is just adequate . 3 . A lighted keyboard -LRB- would have been nice -RRB- as many times we are in the dark or dimly lit room in the evening . Why not make your new customers delighted instead of complaining about ! 4 . If these cost were going to make the margins too lean ask Google for help ! After all this is your first step forward . This should all been done right in the first launch as their is no breaking technology here . Over all I like it a lot - I am concerned about the fan noise . That depends on just how quiet one 's home . After months of use like it more and more - great addition despite all 	Keyboard
First off , I am typing this review on the New Trent Airblue BT keyboard after a full day of use at work without being plugged in . I expect if it has similar battery life to New Trent 's other offering , the Airbender keyboard\/case , it will easily make it through another day before needing to be charged , if not longer . The Airblue is beutiful and instantly drew compliments from my co-workers in the office . `` It 's like a baby MacBook '' was heard more than once . Keyboard size and key spacing is generous and when compared to the Apple BT keyboards many of us use at our desks for our desktop computers , it was practically the same size , meaning you now have near desktop level typing capabilites with your iPad2 . All the special function keys like volume , play\/pause , brightness adjust , screen lock , etc work great and only serve to enhance the seamless integration between the keyboard and the iPad2 . Beware though that the keyboard maintains the device simply by means of gravity and the angle of it 's channel , so you will want to be careful when grabbing it and taking it mobile , or you will quickly remember that it is not in fact a netbook , as your prized posession falls to the desk or ground with a clatter leaving you holding the lightweight and elegant keyboard all by itself . Great keyboard and major conversation starter because everyone will think you have a ninja MacBook they have n't even heard of yet ! 	Keyboard
Google TV sounds pretty cool . And it is ; it 's a great interface that lays on top of your Cable TV and Internet . But it 's first gen and comes with it 's large share of problems which sort of made me feel like a Beta tester . Only I had to pay to be so . I bought Logitech 's flavor of Google TV ; the Revue . Sony 's version is the same software . The cons began outweighing the pro 's for me , so I 'll start with those . - Expensive price compared to other set top boxes -LRB- Roku , Boxee Box or software , AppleTV -RRB- - The keyboard controller is very hard to get cozy with . - Logitech 's Harmony remotes control your entire entertainment center . This package is advertised to include ` Harmony Link ' , which essentially means it 's a dumbed down version that only controls the Google TV , your Receiver , DVR , and your TV . What it does n't control is anything else -LRB- in my case ; computer , xbox , Roku -RRB- . And you ca n't teach it any new commands or execute any Macros . To turn on\/off your system there are 3 power buttons , GoogleTV , Receiver , and TV . - Your cable provider 's very ugly DVR interface is still used when watching TV . This looks strange with Google TV overlaying it , and makes for a slightly confusing experience - -LRB- Wife : `` Am I in GoogleTV now , or Comcast ? '' -RRB- - Google TV works much better with Dish network 's DVR 's . In Google TV 's search box , you can type in any show name , and if it 's available or playing in the future on Dish , it will list the show . From those results you can select an episode and set up a recording right from Google TV . With any other provider , you select the show , then it takes you to your provider 's DVR interface and then you have to manually search for that show that 's airing in 3 weeks . Good luck . - Audio\/Video sync issues . This was almost constant when watching Live TV . Logitech was aware of the issue and was promising a fix , but not within the 30-day return window ; -LRB- - Double View mode -LRB- picture-in-picture -RRB- was only working in some cases . There have been recent updates that have optimized Double View , however . - System is sometimes laggy when navigating through GoogleTV 's menus\/apps . - Tons of networks have blocked Google TV Boxes from accessing their internet content . - Still no Android Marketplace . - And one of my biggest wishes is n't yet available . I want to be able to open one search box , type in an item , hit search , then see a list of results from everything , even services I 'm a member of . Currently you see results from Youtube , Amazon VOD , other internet sites , and your Cable Provider . But no results from Netflix , Blockbuster , Hulu + -LRB- this is n't accessible on gTV yet anyway . . -RRB- , and whatnot . So you have to search service after service to see if the content is available elsewhere . - Controlling the system from your smartphone is pretty cool , but hard to use . The screen keeps turning off and the phone auto-locks . The buttons are all touchscreen so you have to constantly be looking at the screen to press a button . There are many ` possible ' pluses to GoogleTV , like ` This feature will be available in a future update ' , or ` if x signs a deal with y , then google TV will finally get z ' . I 'm going to wait until those updates and deals are made , then buy the latest and greatest gTV hardware available instead of being stuck with this old first gen box . As for the pros : + The keyboard controller is very cool and easy to use when navigating through the menus , surfing the web , or entering search terms . + Searching for content is great . + Dual View -LRB- with recent updates -RRB- is fantastic . + It 's nice being able to quickly overlay a TV show to check something real quick on the web . + Software\/Firmware updates ! Hope this helps . These are opinions from a geek and a wife that both just want a solid , easy-to-use system . We 're still very interested in gTV but want to hold off until faster hardware and more features become available . In the meantime , we 're happy with our Roku , and putting up with Comcast . We rarely use the Boxee software I installed on a dedicated PC because it 's interface is too jumbled\/confusing . Google TV 's interface really shines in comparison . 	Keyboard
I ca n't really write a completely honest review of this keyboard because I returned it as soon as I got it . I returned it because I misread the description and thought it was wireless . I did , however , pull it out of the box to look at it briefly and it seemed very nice . It was sturdy , light , and best of all , very compact -LRB- no numeric keypad on the side -RRB- . Had it been a wireless keyboard as I originally thought , I would have been VERY satisfied with it . For someone who 's looking for a wired keyboard that 's small in size and durable , this would be the way to go , especially for the price . Also , I had no problems at all with returning it to Amazon . AMAZON RULES !! Thanks . 	Keyboard
Despite the Man made errors and misinterpretations Believe I Know The king James version Is The true Bible but Is suppose to be Interpret by Apostle Prophets Anointed by The Holy Ghost that has The Foundation and Knows history and Laws of Nature and common sense . Once You learn to use It works well . I think Its just a matter of opinion If You like the voice or Not and It does have a volume control but It Is In the program . It scrolls while Reading . It also has some other useful features as clock , calculator . What I did Not like and reason did Not get 5 stars Is because the one word search It will only search one word at a time It will Not process two or more words In a Scripture then find that Scripture , I had a Franklin Bible that would do that and The Bible I have that only works with Microsoft will do that but to keep from getting viruses I use Linux on line and when I Am on YouTube doing battle with Them with false doctrines sometimes I have to look up scriptures that Is why I bought this , Not only that This Is easy to carry around . And also Royal cost less than Franklin , I Am so sick of over priced stuff . 	Keyboard
As a full size keyboard and full fuction mouse with great range , this is an excellent product . Set-up takes a minute or so and the connection with the computer is done from a very small usb connector . Since I rarely use all my usb slots this worked perfectly for me . When the connector was put in , it automatically downloaded the drivers to Windows 7 . I was using the combo a couple of minutes after opening the box . What I like about the keyboard is that is extremely easy to get use to and full size . I rarely make a typing mistake , it has all the keys I need and I have gone back a good 20 feet and it is still within-range of the usb connector . There is really no wasted space on the keyboard but at the same time it does not seem crowded . But this is the one drawback for some people that I want to point out . The keyboard is long and rigid . It could become a transportation problem depending upon how people want to use this product . If you are using a small netbook this would be an excellent product at home or at work , but if you want it as a traveling companion be aware of the size . The mouse also has great range , good feel , and it has worked on every surface I have tried it on without losing any accuracy . The software will install if you want a small screen box that allows you to do cap and number lock from the screen and also shows you the connection and battery status of the keyboard and mouse . Bottomline is a good quality product and a good value for the price . It would make using a netbook or even a laptop much easier . Batteries are supplied , set-up is easy , and you will be up and clicking and typing in a couple of minutes . Just know what you want . This is a rigid-non folding keyboard that is quite long . If you are ok with that , then this is an excellent choice . 	Keyboard
30 Day Review - Looks great . Charges quickly from any computer via USB-to-miniUSB . Performs absolutely wonderfully with my New iPad via Bluetooth . It 's quite thin and small , but I 'm a guy with big fingers and I have no trouble with typing on this keyboard . It is very flat , and fits very neatly together with the iPad form , and comes with a decent dust cover that keeps eveything tidy in my soft-sided briefcase . It 's really the perfect size when you need a keyboard on the go - at the cafe , at lunch , etc. . I would not hesitiate to buy another one . 	Keyboard
I only use ergo keyboards . Ca n't use flat ones , since my forearms go numb within a half hour . I bought the MS Natural Ergo 4000 KB to replace an aging PS2 no-name KB . I really did n't need to , my fingers fly on the old KB , but wanted USB and wanted a bit quieter keys . My typical go-to company for accessories like these is Logitech -LRB- just do NOT order direct from Logitech ... go Amazon every time -RRB- . However since Logitech does not have ergo keyboards -LRB- no. . . they do NOT have ergo keyboards ... the wave crap is just a wavy non-ergo KB ... I repeat Logitech does NOT have ergo KBs -RRB- ... hmmm where was I ? I digress . Oh yeah ... since Logitech does n't have ergo KBs , the Microsoft Ergo 4000 seemed to be the most popular one . Thought I 'd give it a try . Quick summary ... I 'm going back to my old PS2 no-name KB . Here are my observations on the MS Ergo 4000 . PROS This KB is very quiet , which I 've come to like . It also has very nice function buttons that you can use to launch a browser , calculator , zoom in and out , and do other functions . It 's black , so shows less finger grime , and I like the cushioned wrist pads . The bottom of the KB elevates for proper typing posture -LRB- I still ca n't fathom why anyone elevates the back of a KB !!! -RRB- , and the split in the keys is very comfortable for me . CONS -LRB- for me , unfortunately they outweigh the pros -RRB- \* This is a non-gaming KB . Now I do n't need a specific `` gaming KB '' to play games , but I do need to be able to press more than 2 or 3 keys simultaneously . With my old PS2 no-namer , I could do that . However , with the MS Ergo 4000 I can not . For example , I crouch -LRB- CTRL -RRB- and move forward -LRB- UP ARROW -RRB- . If I try to move diagonally forward while crouching -LRB- CTRL , UP ARROW , LEFT OR RIGHT ARROW -RRB- , it wo n't work . I just keep moving forward . I can crouch and move a single direction , but I ca n't crouch and move diagonally because that involves 3 simultaneous key presses , which the MS Ergo 4000 does n't support . \* Hate the main ENTER key . My PS2 no-name KB has a large reverse-L-shaped ENTER key . I can smack that thing when I 'm typing or gaming ... ca n't miss it . I type very fast too . The ENTER key on the MS Ergo 4000 is a small horizontal bar , not a larger reverse-L-shaped key . The backslash key is directly above the ENTER key . I 'd say 50 % of the time I hit the backslash when trying to hit ENTER . In 2 months of use with the MS Ergo 4000 , I ca n't overcome the smaller ENTER key . It 's even worse with games , where I need quick access to the ENTER key . Half the time I miss it or I hit multiple keys . \* On my PS2 old KB , the backslash is under the ENTER key , and I use that key for game functions -LRB- I game with mouse and arrow keys , not with WASD keys -RRB- . I find the backslash key on the MS Ergo 4000 to be placed in an inconvenient spot . This is more of a niggling issue , as most KBs have the backslash above the ENTER key , but I like my old KB 's placement of it under the ENTER key . \* The space bar on the MS Ergo 4000 is generally okay if hit near the middle area , but toward the outer edges it sticks and wo n't press . This is n't an issue while typing for me , since my thumb hits it just right of center . However for gaming , my left pinkie finger hits it near the right edge . Maybe 20-30 % of the time it catches and wo n't press when I hit it during a game . \* The ESC key on the MS Ergo 4000 is just below the browser launch button . With my older KB I can hit ESC without looking at it . In fact , I 'm very attuned to the key placement on my older KB , and can hit just about any key anytime without looking . With the MS Ergo , I hit the browser launch button about 40-50 % of the time unless I 'm looking for the key with my eyes . That 's about it . It is a decent KB , comfortable , split very well , and quiet keys . However , I ca n't overcome the smaller ENTER key and the lack of multiple simultaneous key presses for my gaming activities . I 've gone back to my older PS2 KB , and will probably stick with it until computers no longer have PS2 ports ... then I 'll get one of those more pricey PS2 to USB adapters . Unfortunately , no one makes an ergo split KB for gaming specifically that I can find . At least one that meets my criteria for gaming , ENTER key , etc. . Would love to see Logitech make a split ergo KB -LRB- again , that wave stuff is not ergo -RRB- , but companies really are n't too concerned about making really reliable , good ergo split designs . The MS Ergo 4000 is an exception , and it 's a good KB , but just does n't fit my needs . If they redesigned with the larger ENTER key , and maybe 4-5 simultaneous key press support or better , it might be the perfect KB . Until then , I 'll stick with my tried and true . 	Keyboard
The screen protector that came as part of this package was came inside a plastic bag that was inside cardboard covers that were contained within another plastic bag . One side of the screen protector was covered with a thin sheet of plastic , which was held on with a paper label that said to remove it . The other side of the screen protector did NOT have a similar covering , but did have the paper label . This label was almost impossible to remove , and left adhesive on the screen protector that could not be removed , leaving the screen protector useless . It seems pointless to have all of that protection around the screen protector and yet miss the most important piece of protection . If it was not such a small part of the package of items , I would have returned it . The rest of the items appear to be ok . 	Kindle
"I bought this after being disappointed with the Acase for lack of accuracy during note taking . But I had the opportunity to have both products side by side . They are EXACTLY the same thing . I could not find a SINGLE difference . Which leads me to conclude that they are both coming out of the same manufacturing plant in China and then just labeled and repackaged and distributed . So who cares ? Well the Acase <ahref=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003ULE6GU/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/186-1089140-6059313""> Acase Capacitive Stylus for Apple iPad 16GB , 32GB , 64GB WiFi + 3G , iPad 2 , iPhone , iPod , Motorola Xoom , Samsung Galaxy , BlackBerry Playbook -LRB- Jet Black -RRB- </a> is $ 5 cheaper . So I ended up keeping the Acase assuming that a note-taking-stylus is yet to be made . In the mean time this works for keeping my screen clean . "	Kindle
This is a very comfortable stylus . Love the color and the way it interfaces with the screen ... a very stylish stylus ! 	Kindle
This pen works great ! Love it , the only small issue is if you press too hard then the rubber tip can come off . I know do n't press so hard right ? Agreed , however in a classroom it is not always easy to make sure all my students are not pressing down too hard . Otherwise love this pen , have used it a lot ! 	Kindle
I recently bough the stylus for myself in anticipation of purchasing a tablet . It has been so easy to use , and even works on my touch screen phone . There are no limit to the angles at which you can hold the stylus , and the stylus is not too heavy , nor is it lightweight . It has a real `` pen '' feeling . Although I am still getting accustomed to the bulb , it usually selects and writes what I want , and is easy to navigate . I enjoyed it so much , I showed it to my friends , and three of them have already bought their own , in place of the stylus they already owned . I highly recommend this product . Pros - Easy to hold - No limit on angle to write - Real pen feeling Cons - large bulb takes getting used to 	Kindle
With new fresh microfiber cloths I immediately cleaned my camera lens , eyeglasses , iPod screen , tablet screen and 2 computer screens . Wiped away all fingerprints and smudges perfectly . I am starting to clean my cellphones next . Thanks . 	Kindle
"I use a stylus for taking notes and drawing on my Xoom tablet and have tried several types of stylus . Before purchasing the Kensington Metro I had been mainly using a <ahref=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004BSF1I8/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/180-8504617-0858144""> Kensington 2nd Generation Apple iPad 1 and 2 \/ iPhone \/ iPod \/ Motorola Xoom Tablet \/ Galaxy \/ Blackberry Playbook Virtuoso Touch Screen Stylus and Pen -LRB- Black -RRB- Newest Model </a> because of the ability to use as a stylus and a pen . It was a good stylus and decent option , but it had one problem . It does not have a place to put the cap when using it as a pen -LRB- the cap does not fit over the stylus end -RRB- , and it made the pen too short to be comfortable to write with , and I always felt like I was going to lose the cap . So when i saw this updated Kensington option I decided to give it a try . The pen cap DOES fit over the stylus end so you have a place to put it when you are writing -LRB- just make sure it 's on there securely or it will fall off -RRB- . This stylus\/pen also uses the same pen refills as the virtuoso does -LRB- <ahref=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001AFB6YI/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/180-8504617-0858144""> Parker Refill for Retractable Gel Ink Pens , Medium , Black Ink , 2 per Pack -LRB- 30525PP -RRB- </a> is a good one -RRB- . It is comfortable to write with as a pen and also comfortable as a stylus . It works really well on my tablet and does n't skip or stick on the screen -LRB- even with a screen protector on -RRB- , and seems to be accurate . I definitely recommend this stylus as it works just as well as the much higher priced options . "	Kindle
I received the clothes in a very reasonable time and was very anxious to put one of them to work as my Iphone and Ipad needed some cleaning . I have used different kinds of microfiber before but that other one that I got left Lint on my glass display . Not only do this not leave Lint , but they do a Superior job on cleaning . For the price and quality , you can not go wrong with these . I hope to get more later too . I am going to check and see if they have bigger ones to help clean the 20 '' IMAC display . Very much recommend !!! 	Kindle

I 'm grateful Amazon.com offered this item to me as ` an item I may be interested in purchasing . ' All I can say is Wow ! This item and the kindle fire are meant to go together . It makes navigating so smooth and effortless now . On top of that , the screen is cleaner without all the finger smudges I used to have . You could n't go wrong with this item . 	Kindle
Item ordered was shipped promptly . It does remove fingerprints & oil with just a swipe . Just as advertised . Highly recommend . 	Kindle
This stylus was undoubtedly one of the best products I have ever purchased . It 's an amazing little gadget that is ideal for anyone who has trouble using their fingers or hands . I bought it for my wife who is only able to use the thumb and index fingers on each hand . She was having a lot difficulty using her new IPAD but the stylus corrected that . She can now use it with no problems . She also uses it on her Nook . We 've had no problems with it since we purchased it . It works 99 % of the time . I 'm planning on ordering another as a backup . For the price , it 's a must for anyone with a hand disability . 	Kindle
I took a chance when I ordered this product because I had not even seen one but was told it would be a help with my Kindle Fire for ease of use . I ca n't say enough good about it or my Kindle Fire . Both I would recommend and love my purchases . 	Kindle
I have had a number of different styli , the BoxWave is by far the best I have used . I have been on airplanes where others have seen me using this and ask to try it , the conclusion is always the same ; they love it . It may be a bit more expensive than others on the market , but if you need a stylus every day for work like I do , it is well worth the money to buy a couple of these . 	Kindle
I use this hub to avoid power issues I had with my PS3 setup . My PS3 has a 25 foot USB extension cable , which first connected to a passive hub . I was running into some power issues , but adding this hub with its heavy duty power supply -LRB- 2.5 A is more than enough for me now -RRB- , I can feed the following : - A Penguin United EEC -LRB- Eagle Eye Converter -RRB- , which has a Razer Abyssus mouse and a Wolfking Warrior keyboard connected to it . - A Turtle Beach Earforce DSS -LRB- 5.1 \/ 7.1 to Dolby Headphone converter -RRB- , which also has a Turtle Beach P11 headset with micadapter connected to it . All lights on this contraption now light up full-blast -LRB- kind of annoying , playing games with all those leds in front ! : -RRB- -RRB- , and it has no conflicts with the PS3 . Everything works fine , so I 'm happy . Not sure about the speeds I can achieve with it , but these are all simple peripherals anyway . One con : That big bright led on it . Costs 1 star . Another disadvantage , but I knew that since it has this passive battery charging thing on the ports : It would be nice if it would disconnect the power from the ports when I switch off the PS3 , so all the other peripherals have their lights off as well . Nice stuff and plugable are a manufacturer I 'd not be afraid to buy from . 	Kindle
I bought this item for my HP Tocuhpad . When I got it , it worked pretty well . For the money , it is a good product . I had a bit of difficulty getting it to work at first , but that might of been due to my screen protector being on . All in all , good for the price and you get what you pay for . 	Kindle
I thought I could write on the iPad using the stylus as if I were writing with a pencil\/pen . My perception is that the stylus must be held virtually at a 90 degree angle to the iPad in order to write , and then it sometimes is hit-and-miss . I was hoping to use my iPad for note writing during interviews with patients , but now I 'm not so sure . The 90 degree angle is awakward . 	Kindle
Since I live in Phoenix , Arizona the sun was always beating down on my car and the GPS would fall off my window . My husband would have to keep reattaching it and he was getting very frustrated . I purchased the Dashboard Mount for my Magellan and it stays put and does n't need to be removed for any reason . I just love this product . If you are even considering purchasing it , go right ahead and I think you will be as pleased as I am . 	Kindle
Love this product ! Works simple easy to use and works really well . I purchased one for myself loved it and bought several more as gifts . Perfect for any E-reader ! Shipped quickly arrived in great condition . 	Kindle
I love this stylus . It works great and fits in the case I bought ! This is my first stylus but I would buy it again ! 	Kindle
Case broke after less than 1 second of use . Horribly cheap and flimsy . However , I extracted the light from the el-cheapo case and epoxied it onto my Kindle . I expect this will be a pretty decent lighting solution after doing that . 	Kindle
This is wayyyy better than the pogo stylus that I tried out at the apple store . The stylus tip is not fuzzy and I was a little unsure if it was sturdy since it feels like a thin piece of rubber but it works great . I use this for sketching on my ipad and it 's pretty precise -LRB- you 're not going to get in little details though -RRB- , but sometimes when I draw , I randomly get an unwanted jagged line . I 'm not sure if it 's the stylus or if my hand causing it . I also like that it has a pen that writes smoothly on the other end . It 's lightweight , functional , and I totally recommend it ! 	Kindle
I was familiar with the Boxwave brand by way of my iPhone . The film for the Fire is equally good . As with any screen protector film , it takes time and patience to install . It took me two films to get it right but it was worth the effort . I highly recommend this product and would definitely use it again . 	Kindle
They always provide a great product on time . Will use again . The natal stylus is a superior product compared to the plastic ones . 	Kindle
This is really a fantastic idea . The USB cord that comes with the DualFLUX charger is long enough that my daughter can have it plugged into our charger in the back and still watch movies on the Kindle Fire . The cord is also compatible with my phone , which is hard to find , so I am thrilled with this product . It 's small enough to take up minimal space for storage also . 	Kindle
I had used the Pogo Sketch for a couple months with the iPad and thought it was o.k. . But it was too narrow\/skinny and the spongey tip would often seem to `` stick '' and not move easily across the screen . When the plastic pocket clip broke off my Pogo , I decided to look for something better . The Boxwave stylus is much better ! It 's heavier and thicker like a fine writing instrument , has a nice metal pocket clip , a harder rubber tip that 's more rounded than the Pogo allowing it to glide across the iPad screen with ease . Finally , there 's a nice little removable lanyard that allows it to be secured via the headphone jack -- ingenious ! I use the Boxwave with Penultimate and iAnnotatePDF on the iPad and have now completely eliminated the need to use real pens and paper for jotting down notes . I just wish this was a tad bit longer -LRB- it 's only the length of an iPhone -RRB- . But that 's a minor issue . The Boxwave is still comfy and well-balanced to use . it 's a keeper ! 	Kindle
Being a new Kindle 3 user , I just had to have a retractable cable as a spare and for on-the-go usage . I think I ordered this one day , and received it the next -LRB- or perhaps the following -RRB- day . Out of the box , I was able to connect it to my Kindle , transfer new ebooks , and fully recharge my EReader . What more could a customer ask for ? One could hit up lots of local stores in hope of finding something like this - or just order online . 	Kindle
Did anyone receive a `` retractable data cable '' with their order ? I did not and realized it when I opened the package and there was no way to charge the kindle . Luckily I have a USB data cord that has a removable plug and was able to use this with the adapter that came with the order to charge the Kindle . Not sure if this was an oversight in the packaging or if it is misrepresented in the description of the product . 	Kindle
This is the neatest little gadget . I use it all the time for my Nook Tablet and also to hold cook books so I can read the recipe easily . I would recommend this item to anyone who 's arms and hands get tired of holding your e-reader . I really like mine and use it allot . 	Kindle
Shortly after receiving these I found the original stylus that I had lost and was attempting to replace with these . I then tossed this sub-par stylus to my wife for use with her Kindle . I 'm now happy to be using the Targus Stylus that I bought at Best Buy 15 months ago again . 	Kindle
I bought this for my iPad . Simply put , it 's a must-have device -- especially if you 're traveling . It 's inexpensive , lightweight and it folds flat . Perfect ! BTW , the `` fingers '' do not intrude into the iPad 's screen space . I wondered about that . 	Kindle
I use this solely for the ForeFlight scratch pad - jotting down taxi instructions , squawk codes , and frequencies . It has worked great without fail , no hiccups or issues with it writing on the scratch pad . 	Kindle
These are good quality cloths . Bought them to clean my iPhone and they work great . Customer service was very good as well . 	Kindle
This anti-glare screen is the best ! It was easy to install and fit my Fire perfectly . It only took one try to be successful ; the few air bubbles that popped up as I unrolled the backing were easily `` scraped '' to the sides and eliminated by using the smoothing card . After I finished , it was totally impossible to see that any protective screen was on my device , except for the tiny indented cut-out on the top left corner where the sensor is . This screen also `` feels '' better to touch . And , it does not affect the device 's sensitivity at all . It is one heck of a value for the price . 	Kindle
I bought this to use with the note taker app for the iPad . At first I loved it , dual purpose both pen and stylus . After about a week , I noticed the capacitive tip began getting stuck in certain places , so I would twist the stylus to find the smooth spot . About another week later , a crack developed in the capacitive tip rendering it virtually worthless . The tip can not be replaced -LRB- to my knowledge -RRB- so I now have a pen only . I also bought the Parker metal gel replacement cartridges and they did n't fit . Better stick to the plastic cartridges . I ended up purchasing the Just Mobile AluPen and so far it is far superior . I would not recommend purchasing this unless they add a replaceable tip . 	Kindle
Stylish and precise . I recommend this product . Only con : the little cord is specifically design for Kindle and does not work for Ipad . No problem for me as I have a little pocket on my case to carry it , but it might be a con for other users . 	Kindle
Item works as described . I use it for my ipad for 6 weeks already . Very easy to use . Never had any problem . Mainly use the pen for notes taking . If the stylus had a finer point , that will be perfect . but I have no complaint . It is still better than writing notes with finger . I will buy again . 	Kindle
Not having used such a pen before , I do n't really have a good baseline from which to judge , but I can make a few comments . It seems well-built , to possess good heft , and would make for a good pen ; however , it has a problem -LRB- or my Lenovo tablet has a problem -RRB- being recognized from time to time . This led me to tap much harder than I would 've preferred , which has led to me using my fingers more than the pen . There may be better models , and there are likely much worse ones , which is why I 'm placing it just ahead of mid-pack . 	Kindle
When I ordered my Kindle Fire I knew I wanted a stylus to use with it . I did n't want to spend a lot of money . I bought this one because it looked nice and I thought a good price . The tip that touches the screen is so soft it almost feels like it 's filled with air . It is very comfortable in my hand and of course wo n't scratch the screen because it 's such a nice soft rubber tip . 	Kindle
My only problem with my Kindle Fire was trying to get my big fat fingers to use the tiny keyboard . This stylus is the solution ! So inexpensive too ! 	Kindle
Using this for our Viewsonic G Tablet and it works great . Holding a tablet for extended amounts of time get VERY tiring . Love how easy it is to snap on , how stable it is , and its compactness . Would definitely recommend for any tablet device . 	Kindle
This product solved my 1 + year pain of fixing the TomTom gps in my Jeep . An amazing product that holds my TomTom X310 GPS and my iPhone - hassle free . 	Kindle
I must be missing something because this thing has a low accuracy rate and is terrible for writing . First , it is a nicely made and it does feel good to hold . I just ca n't recommend this items unless it was less than $ 5 . It has about a 50 % chance of registering on my iPad . Simple things like swiping left or right is chore which causes me to use my finger instead . The apps I used it with are Penultimate and Adobe Ideas . The main reason I bought this was to take notes . It fails miserably here , let me explain . Even at the finest tip setting , this Boxwave Sylus will input the same amount of width as my finger would . This causes words to have that bold look and I have to be extra careful when writing the letter `` e '' because it looks like a c '' . It works better with Adobe 's Idea app because I can get a finer tip when writing but this program was not meant for writing . Therefore I ca n't find any real use for this as I really wanted to write notes with the kind of accuracy you get with pen and paper . I ca n't tell if the iPad itself does not have the ability to accept the proper input or the pen is at fault . Since other people here claim that a stylus can work wonders , it leads me to believe that this stylus is n't what I 'm looking for . 	Kindle
It 's a better stylus than some -LRB- Pogo -RRB- , and equally as good as the Griffin stylus -- writes smoothly , not bad to hold -- but not as good as the Bamboo or Targus styli because it 's just a little too short . 	Kindle
This stylus works fantastically with my iPad and iPhone . I use it everyday and I find that it is way more useful then using my finger . It is easier to play games and to draw now that is use the stylus . It is also great for browsing the web and selecting the small links on the page , whereas if I use my finger , I may hit the wrong link on accident . Overall I think this is a great product and anybody with an iDevice should definitely get one . 	Kindle
We bought these primarily to use with a drawing app on the iPad and this works very well . Then we found ourselves also using it with other apps even safari . They work very well and seems to be just the right size . 3 pack means we can leave one next to the bed , another one next to the couch , etc. . 	Kindle
Purchased for the Droid2 and works very well . Tip seems like it would last a long time and the clip keeps the stylus put until I am ready to use it . This was worth the premium price . 	Kindle
I received my order as promised and in great condition . I was concerned after reading other reviews about having it stolen upon delivery but not a problem where I live . I have had no problems with the Kindle , it is one with a keyboard and have used it quite a lot . I should have read closer about needing the accessories since the only thing I needed from that order was the screen guard . The kindle comes with a usb wall charger and I have earphones . Should have saved my money and not bought all of the accessories . I have been happy with my purchase as I found I can borrow books for free from my local library and do n't even have to leave home . 	Kindle
It works well - I hope it lasts because it 's not cheap for what it is . My only complaint is that I wish they could make the tip smaller on these things so that you could write with more precision . 	Kindle
I travel a lot , and I loke to have retractable cables . This one works for charging my I-phone - but I have a battery case on my I-Phone , and the device would definitely not fit a standard I-phone charging port . 	Kindle
received the package of stylus -LRB- 3 -RRB- in timely manner - although the packing was a little over kill . I think this could have been shipped in an enforced envelope without any issue . But it was shipped in fairly large box with a lot of padding . I received stylus and immediately tried one out on my ViewSonic GTablet -- but it did n't work very well with this . I had to press down much harder on the device than I really wanted . But , I did try it on my samsung droid smartphone and there it just SHINES !! I find using one of these stylus on my phone is great ! I do n't get a lot of the oils from my fingers on the screen , the touch is just fine and I can now push the buttons -LRB- especially when using the internal keypad -RRB- so much easier and make far less mistakes . I 've even turned one of the stylus over to my hubby so that he can quite grumbling about trying to enter letters and push the buttons because his fingers are ` just too big ' ! I think he will really like it for his smartphone also . so , the stylus works . You just have to ensure the device is acceptable . 	Kindle
I have purchased 2 of these stylus in the past year , both of them ripped on the tip by regular usage . I tried to get the manufacturer to replace the item but was told that the item is out of warranty . Never once acknowledging the poor workmanship in the design of the stylus . This is a definite buyer beware item and for a person who has purchased 2 since this past March I would not suggest purchasing this item . In the end I 'm just fortunate that I did n't damage my iPad . 	Kindle
I have n't tried any other styluses , so maybe this is how all of them are , but sometimes the sensitivity is a little lacking . I find myself having to push hard at times and others the slightest touch will do . Overall , it serves it 's purpose and I ca n't do with my finger what I can do with this stylus . I recommend it to anyone for normal use , I myself use it for drawing and it works fairly well . Maybe there is something better out there , but I have n't needed to find one yet . 	Kindle
I bought these because they were relatively inexpensive , but you get what you pay for . They feel cheezy , have no balance -LRB- they are hollow aluminum tubes -RRB- , and I 'm still not sure what the little string on the end is for . A pocket clip would have been nicer . The Samsung stylus is much better and not that much more . Buting this was definately a mistake . Aside from the feel , though , they work just fine . Since this is just personal preference and not a product defect , I am giving it three stars . 	Kindle
This is a GREAT little charging station for my E-readers , my Kindle and phone and even IPOD . Everything has a place . . GREAT item ! 	Kindle
Bought stylus for Kindle Fire & it works great & was priced well . The size & weight are both good for typing & playing games\/Internet use etc & the end of the stylus is soft enough , yet durable & flexable & firm enough in the center that it works well for selecting yet also dragging\/pulling objects in games and\/or programs like adobe acrobat . in comparison I have bought some cheaper styluses & the ends were made of tight plastic which was ok for selecting but not dragging or pulling . 	Kindle
I searched high and low for a stylus to use with my iPad that could not only be used as a `` punching device '' but also as a writing instrument . This stylus received high reviews for all colors across the board . If you want to be able to write with this stylus pass it up . Your device will not respond to it and it will make a squeaking sound . I 'm VERY disappointed . I understand that any stylus meant to be used with apple products frequently do not have tips like a regular stylus but they should at least respond to writing movements . 	Kindle
This stylus with the fiber mesh tip is a lot smoother than the other rubber type tips on others . This glides smooothly across the iPad screen and after a week or two does n't show any wear . The tip is a good size if you like to use the stylus to tap all over the screen in place of your fingers . However , I was looking for a stylus that would make it easier to hand write notes in the notebook aps and this one does half the job really well ! This fiber mesh tip is wonderful at gliding across the iPad screen , but the tip is a little too thicker than I was hoping for . It seems that none of these stylus have very thin tips , so for durability and smoothness of use , I am giving this product 5 stars for exceeding my expectations after working with a rubber tip stylus . I was concerned that it would n't have enough `` stick '' to scroll through screens , but it does just fine . 	Kindle
I bought this for my wife as she was ready to smash the phone out of frustration for lack of responsiveness and pretty bad accuracy when input data . I told her to cut fingernail and use only very tip , having fancy nails makes ladies feel more feminine I guess , so she refused . So she tried this mega expensive device and rubber tip fall off almost day one . We both experience lack of accuracy and responsiveness . In my experience , it was just a waist of time and money . To be fair , HTC hero has smaller screen than average Android devices , and Sprint\/HTC will not provide Android 2.2 Froyo to htc hero wich includes numerous improvements on the issue . Her solution : Now she went fancy and got herself a Samsung 4G and no more need for this device . Another option but a risky one is trying to install a custom rom with updated Android OS to froyo . there 's also a diy solution : cheaper , do n't know if better : instructables -LRB- dot -RRB- com\/id\/Cheap-Ipod-Pogo - Stylus-not-aluminum-foil \/ 	Kindle
I was fed up when the glass cracked on my tomtom gps after it fell off the dash for the umpteenth time because the suction cup `` let go '' . This mount is wonderful . It sets securely on the dash of my Mazda CX9 , no jiggling or sliding under normal driving conditions . When I need to input an address or make a change , I simply pick up the entire thing with my gps still securely attached , type what I need , then place the mount back where I want it . I highly recommend this one ! 	Kindle
Apple missed the boat when it came to supplying a stylus with the Ipad but BoxWave stepped up to the plate and designed a very good product that works just great ! 	Kindle
I have been looking for a stylus for my tablet recently , and looked all over amazon to try to find the best one . This is the first one I tried , and from using it so far , it is going to be perfect for taking notes using Evernote during class . The only thing that I was worries about it the rubber not sliding on the screen , but it slides perfectly . It slides right along , and feels basically like writing on a whiteboard . I am completely satisfied with this stylus , especially for the sale price of 8 dollars . I would most definitely recommend this no matter what you need the stylus for . Even if you just like to hold something physical in your hand while you browse the internet , this is the perfect thing for you . 	Kindle
I find I do n't use this as much as I thought I would . I ordered it when I got my new phone & iPad . It feels rather spongy to me when I use it and despite it connecting very nicely to the headphone port I tend to forget it is in the case because I seldom remember to reconnect it to the headphone port . I do n't know how it could be improved . It does work . It does n't scratch the screen . It 's not bad it 's just ... not great I suppose . 	Kindle
The main reason I purchased the stylus was to use it with the FastFinga note taking app on the iPad . I use my iPad to take notes in meetings and found that it was always distracting to me and others if I was typing the notes . I have terrible handwriting but the combination of the stylus and the FastFinga app allow me to take very clean notes . It also works great with sketching apps and I 've found it to be very useful with the ArcGis app . I 'm very pleased with my purchase . 	Kindle
I read many reviews on the web looking for a good stylus to use with my drawing apps -LRB- ArtStudio , Sketchbook Pro , Draw Cast -RRB- and finally chose this product . It has made all the difference in using these apps to their fullest . For my purposes , this little stylus is perfect ! I use it daily and it has not shown any sign of wear or decrease in responsiveness . I have small hands , so the size is actually comfortable . I like how it keeps smudges off the screen , and is less fatigue on my hand than finger swiping or tapping . I also use this with Penultimate . In addition , it make game playing -LRB- such as time management or HOG games -RRB- much easier . As with any of the styli that clips to the device via the headphone jack , it 's important to have a screen protector to keep from scratching your device , if you do use this feature . 	Kindle
I bought the Bookgem primarily to hold my Kindle , and it performs that function satisfactorily . The Kindle 3 fits securely into it , both horizontally or vertically . The Bookgem is also very light and portable - when folded up it can easily fit into a pocket - so it pairs very well with the Kindle . The only gripe I have with using the Bookgem for my Kindle is that the Kindle slider \* does \* gets obstructed by the clips when placed vertically on the Bookgem -LRB- which is how I always use it -RRB- , so that you have to remove the Kindle in order to wake it up whenever it goes to screensaver mode . This might sound like a very minor annoyance , but it is a hassle if you tend to get distracted from your reading and your Kindle goes to screensaver very often . I however simply can not recommend the Bookgem if your aim is to use it for physical books . It is a challenge trying to fit a book into the Bookgem . First , you need to pull the clips forward with one hand -LRB- particularly difficult to do if you have small or weak hands - the ends of the two clips are quite far apart , and the springs holding them shut are very strong -RRB- . Then , with your other hand , you need to keep your book open , maneuver it into the Bookgem , AND at the same time separate out a few pages to tuck into the page slot -LRB- making sure they do n't get caught on the rubber grips -RRB- . You then have to repeat this process each time you run out of pages in your page slot . It is simply far too much trouble and inconvenience for something that is supposed to simplify your reading experience . Furthermore , the Bookgem tends to damage the spine of your books -LRB- especially paperbacks -RRB- , since its clips will spread your book wide and press down firmly on both ends . I personally never open my books completely when reading for fear of spoiling the spine , so this is a big negative . 	Kindle
The reviews I read were mostly positive for this pen , but it did not impress me . When using an iPad , you have to press a tad harder than I thought to get a response from the pen . Very annoying . Plus , the tip is super soft . When trying to use the pen on an angle , I feel you can scratch the iPad screen with the aluminum casing when pressing down on it too hard . I will be buying a proper stylus pen from Wacom . 	Kindle
This stylus has been the best out of all the different stylus 's I have tried . Amazon Basics has become known to me for making quality merchandise and I would definitely recommend their products to anyone looking for quality and durability . 	Kindle
"I purchased this in February and only used it 4 times and the rubber tip ripped ! What a piece of crap ! No child was in use of this item either ! I would not recommend this item to anyone wanting a stylus ! It is of no use as the metal inside can damage a screen ! <ahref=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004GCJEZU/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/176-0438848-3925905""> AmazonBasics Stylus for Touchscreen Devices Including Kindle Fire , Apple iPad 2 , the New iPad , Motorola Xoom , Samsung Galaxy Tab , BlackBerry PlayBook </a> "	Kindle
I 've been using smart phones and both versions of the iPad for a good while now , and the most irritating thing about them is the way the screens gets so smudged up -LRB- and filthy -RRB- due to all the tapping one has to do on the screens of these devices . That is primarily why I wanted to try a product like this TouchTec iPad Stylus - I hoped that tapping the screen with it would not leave behind a bunch of little circle-shaped smudges on the screens . And the good news is that it works exactly as I had hoped . Now , I wo n't have to wipe down the screens two or three times a day . My only wish is that the stylus tip diameter would have been a bit smaller -LRB- I 'm not sure if I have the 8mm diameter pen or the one with a 6mm diameter , so this might not be a problem at all for others -RRB- . I 'm using the stylus to navigate the iPad and smart phone I currently own , not in support of any specific software that would allow me to write or take notes on a device , so it 's a case of `` the smaller the better . '' But even with the tip I have on this one , I seldom hit a link that I was n't aiming at . The stylus looks like a ball point pen , and the one included is of good quality -LRB- black ink and what seems to be a `` fine '' point -RRB- . It has the weight and feel of a slightly heavier than average pen , but the balance is very good whether one is using the ball point pen or the screen stylus . Overall : this is a first class product that should be good for a long time . I just have to make sure that I do n't lose it the way that I do so many regular ball point pens . 	Kindle
This is a great product and my husband gives it 5 stars . I purchased this for a gift for him . The only thing that would make it slightly better for him is a longer lanyard so that you could more easily attach it to secure the device and use it while secured . To him this suggestion was n't enough to decrease his rating to 5 stars 	Kindle
This is a nice pen for the iPad . I love the weight , texture , etc. . The cable at the top fits nice in the headphone port of the iPad if you want to tether . 	Kindle
It was one of the first accessories I went on the hunt for when my iPad arrived on `` Early Adopter Saturday . '' : - -RRB- I knew that handwritten notes would be a killer use for the device , allowing me to consolidate my note-taking , calendaring and To-Do ` ing on one iPad . Unfortunately for me , the early attempts at creating a usable stylus for the capacitive touch slate were less than satisfactory , and despite their cost , ended up in my trash can . Then , came the BoxWave . I 'd almost given up looking , but gave it a shot and was pleasantly surprised at how much `` feel '' it transmitted to the iPad , and how much it felt like writing on a pad of paper . Top notch . 	Kindle
Ok , this is my first Amazon review , my bf bought me the Elago stylus for my iPad . Got the pink one and received the next day . After 2 rough drafts & in the middle of an essay , the rubber tip came off ! I mean what the heck !!! We paid extra shipping for it so I could have it right away , only to find out that it 's a piece of crap ! And so , we googled best stylus for iPad , and read all the amazon reviews , and all out there about the Boxwave Capacitive . I checked out first the Best Buy here and other local stores , but they dont carry the Griffin one . And so we decided to go for the Boxwave . And we are so glad !!! I found what I 'm looking for a stylus . I dont like the Elago , and Pogosketch though it comes with moree colors esp . Pink because the tip is so soft . Like maybe if your sketching lightly but if you 're like me who writes all the time , and use Noteshelf , or Penultimate or other notetaking apps out there , you wiukd notice that it 's so hard to write properly with a soft rubber tip . You have to press harder as you write . When you draw a line , and try to just glide the pogo & elago , it will not draw a line , you would need to press on the ipad more to get a line , what more with letters , and tons of them . By the 2nd paragraph , my hand is sweaty & tired . But I could take it , coz I dont want to waste money . Man oh man , and while I was writing , therubber came off ! Boy was I pissed ! But the Boxwave , my goshhhhh , it glides easily without putting pressure . And I found out that using Upad , that software is more sensitive than Noteshelf , I mean the handwriting precision is just awesome . I gave it 4 stars because unlike the Elago , the Boxwave doesnt come with a cap . I dont like the idea of taking the string in and out of the headphone jack , Im scared it might ruin the jack for my headfones . Unlike the elago , wherein I can just take thepen itself and the cap stays on the jack & when ure done writing u just reattach the styles to its cap . Also there 's more fun colors . Butother than that '' ... ... . Boxwave is a lifesaver !! 	Kindle
it keeps pad from getting prints on it ... usefull for 1 finger typing like i do lol but because it attaches to the top of the ipad ... its in the way so you set it down ... loose it and because your fingers are attached to you you use fingers as theres no place to put the stylus thats not in the way ... may i sugest you make a leather case that also holds it 	Kindle
Its great . It slides easily on your iPad screen and the rubber is just right . Not to soft and not to hard . It even comes with a handy connector to the headphone jacket so you wo n't misplace it . 	Kindle
I bought this stylus hoping to use it for note-taking . However , it is almost impossible to take notes with this stylus . All that it is good for is touching the screen like I do with my fingers , only without smudging the screen . I 'm trying the Jot-Pro for note taking . 	Kindle
Works great on the kindle fire . Narrow rubber point easier for playing scrabble on words for friends . Has choice of attaching to headphone jack or use the clip . This is definitely better than amazon stylus . 	Kindle
Pen felt nice in weight and tip is well made . Would have appreciated a 3.5 mm headphone clip rather than what came on it . Having an earphone clip would have been more convenient . 	Kindle
This stylus works with my Nook Color , and should work with any touchscreen device . Hold it like a pencil , use a little pressure , and you can navigate without leaving any fingerprints or smudges on your touchscreen . The stylus works even if you have protective plastic film installed . The `` business end '' looks like a pencil eraser , but is actually a softly inflated , flexible ball that fools your tablet , phone , or e-reader into thinking the stylus is your finger . The stylus is 4-5\/8 '' long , and includes a lanyard with a mysterious , specialized , triangular connector . Presumably the `` female '' connector attaches to a `` male '' counterpart on one of the named compatible devices -LRB- Kindle Fire , Apple iPad 2 , Motorola Xoom , Samsung Galaxy Tab , Blackberry Playbook -RRB- . If you do n't have anything to connect it to , the mystery connector is decorative -- and the lanyard is easily removed if you do n't like having nonfunctional connector triangles around . I like this low-tech gadget quite well , because I do n't like looking at an oily , smeared touchscreen . However , the stylus is best used for simple navigation tasks like turning book pages , changing screens or settings , or selecting items by touching or tapping . In a game like `` Angry Birds '' , the stylus is n't accurate enough for aiming and shooting , and it releases the birds too quickly . I rate this device at 4.5 stars , rounded up to 5 stars , even though it does n't completely replace your finger , because it gets extra style points for its elegant black and silver looks . 	Kindle
This stylus is great , far better than using your fingers . First of all , it leaves no grimmy fingerprints . Then there ` sthe fact that it 's much smaller than the average finger tip , allowing for smaller lines\/text and more accurate positioning of your input . I 'll definitely be ordering at least one more of these very well designed stylus . And one nice extra feature is the molded plastic fastener at the end of the lanyard . It snaps into the headphone jack to keep it from getting lost . Very cool ! 	Kindle
I got this for my Kindle Fire . The tip is rubbery and soft and reacts to the Kindle just fine , but i wish it was a little smaller . The way it is , it is n't much smaller than my fingertip . i got it to be able to touch things like links or play certain games with more precision so I kind of feel like it was a waste of money . Also , there 's no possible way of attaching it to my Kindle or my Kindle Cover , so i 'm no doubt going to end up losing it at some point . 	Kindle
The pen looks and feels nice , but it is too light for my taste . I like pens that are a little heaver and feel like real pens I use to write on paper . One very annoying aspect of this pen is that the back part keeps falling off . Hence , if I wanted to put this pen in the pocket inside my jacket , I would probably lose it . I do not like the overall quality and can not recommend this pen . 	Kindle
Got the stylus and it is a good solid creation , the little chain plug thingy is ok , but could use a longer string\/cable so one need not unplug it to use . Was hoping for a sharp pointed stylus like a more dense , stiffer pointier tip than what all the styluses have , but for the most part this one does the job and a good low price too . would recommend to others as well . 	Kindle
"Bought for wife 's iPad , she loved it . I used it as well . Pros : It is very helpful for precision pointing , dragging , and clicking . It is great on the key pad window and allows for perfect accuracy in touching keys . On small dialog boxes it is great for selection accuracy as well . It is easy to use and well made . There are no need for batteries . It has a small lanyard that plugs into the external speaker socket . The idea being you will be less likely to lose it . Cons : In order to use it one must disconnect the lanyard from the IPad . This allows one to use it freely like a pen . Since the stylus is a single point device one can not use it to re-size the image which requires two fingers and a pinch or reverse pinch type move . Keeping track of the styles proved to be a problem for us and eventually after two months we lost it .

"	Kindle
This is the perfect choice to go with your kindle . Not expensive but has everything you need for home or travel . 	Kindle
The best stylus I have used , very smooth , worth the $ 20 . I also bought the stylus\/pen combo to keep in my purse . 	Kindle
Good quality stylus that makes drawing easy . Not too short like some other styluses in the market . It seems to be durable . I would recommend if you use a lot of drawing applications . 	Kindle
The device is fine for button pushing and not bad for drawing however if you want to take handwritten notes with ipad apps like Note Taker HD , newNotes , WritePad , Penultimate or the others I tried , do n't waste your time . The problems are - 1 . The round `` nub '' you touch the pad with is huge and not very accurate for handwriting . A somewhat pointed tip would be better . 2 . It is not very responsive with the device . It works best when you move slow and have as much of the `` nub '' touching the screen is possible . Its a very blunt and inaccurate tool that is not very good for taking handwritten notes on the ipad . 	Kindle
"I ordered this <ahref=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000BUI76S/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/189-3035342-7303603""> BoxWave Capacitive Stylus for Apple iPad 3 -LRB- Jet Black -RRB- </a> from Amazon.com for my new iPad -LRB- third generation -RRB- . I 'm new to the tablet scheme and I 've always wanted one of these -LRB- both the iPad and stylus -RRB- to draw and write with . This stylus without a doubt is the one I need . What I liked about this stylus : - For the price and reputation this pen has , I thought it was a steal compared to brick and mortar stores where their pricing starts at around $ 15 . - Comes with a nifty headphone jack plug anchor -LRB- no idea what to call it -RRB- that keeps me from losing the stylus . - Also comes with a clip to clip things to , I clip this on top of my <ahref=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007E54W58/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/189-3035342-7303603""> Bear Motion  Premium Folio Case for iPad 3 </a> and anchor plugged into the jack . - Smooth writing , this glides like a pen on my screen . - Decently weighted , it feels slightly heavier than your average pen . - A metal material -LRB- except for the anchor and tip of course -RRB- . - Minimalist design . - Perfect for writing , drawing , etc. -LRB- I use it a lot for the game `` Draw Something '' , very addicting game -RRB- . - What more can I say with a stylus ? What I did n't like with this stylus : - It 's slightly shorter than your average pen , so it may feel a little odd to hold at first . - The chain that holds the pen and anchor gets a little noisy at times , but bearable . Overall , there is nothing notably bad about this pen . The price is cheap , the quality is good and I would consider buying another one of these if this pen gets misplaced . I would recommend this to anyone looking for a stylus pen . General Tips : - The pen does not require much force to register on the screen , I use about the same pressure I would put in as using a marker . - Using a stylus may feel odd at first , but should feel like second nature after extended use . - My iPad has a screen protector , but it 's the smooth dry application one -LRB- <ahref=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004QZL0RC/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/189-3035342-7303603""> myGear Products `` The new iPad '' & Apple iPad 2 Screen Protectors 4 PACK Films </a> to be exact -RRB- . So far it 's very smooth the use for me . I would guess the `` orange peel '' type protectors is not smooth enough for a stylus , that 's why it might break -LRB- in theory . But I could be wrong . -RRB- . I 'll update this review in the future if the tip ever breaks off from regular use . "	Kindle
Works OK with tablets without screensavers . Used for a short time without screensaver and it worked fine . A little slow reaction time compaired to finger , but ok . Adding a screensaver makes slower reaction times . Lenovo K1 with Armorsuit screensaver . 	Kindle
I really love this product . It is so great for use with products with the touch screen . I use it with my Kindle Fire , and also my Iphone . And you ca n't beat the price ! 	Kindle
great product ... easy to use . So easy to store and access at any time . I have had to order one for my wife as well . 	Kindle
Very nice stylus and works great on my Kindle Fire ... ... I just wish it ` connected ' in some way . I 've already lost one and had to order another . Otherwise , great purchase and I 'm very happy ! 	Kindle
I dont know of any company that I would say has good customer service any more ... but i will tell you what ... this is one . I had the same issue as someone else where I had issue with the rubber point and it stopped working well with the pen . I was so frustrated that I had an issue after just a few months ... i was ready to go back to not using a stylus for my Ipad -LRB- this was my third stylus ... all of them seem to have issues of one sort or another -RRB- . Out of frustration I penned an email that I thought for sure would never get answered . Not only was it answered that day ... i have my brand new pen just a few days after i wrote the initial email ... I just can not believe that service . I loved the pen ... loved that there is no cap to lose ... love that it had a ball point pen ... really disappointed about the rubber point having issues ... but now blown away that there was no questions asked customer satisfaction ! incredible . Thanks Jerry ! 	Kindle
Not cracked up to what it is to be . Disappointing and costly . Seen better ones and reasoable ones at Bestbuy . 	Kindle
I thought these might last for at least a little while , but i guess you get what you pay for . I received these , and the same day , sound is not playing out of one earbud -LRB- the right -RRB- . Thing is i 'm not hard on them at all , rather gentle , actually . Sound quality is alright , about what i expected for this price . I would advise spending a little more money and purchasing a more well-known and durable brand . 	Kindle
The metal bezel on a previous stylus I had scratched my screen protector , but the Nataal has a rounded bezel that ca n't scratch the screen . The Nataal stylus has also got a nice weight , and is comfortable to write with . 	Kindle
Ordered this mainly as a reading lamp . It looks nice . It was really easy to put together . And one thing I love is , though the on-off switch is at the top of the lamp , there is a separate switch on the cord that I can keep by my side , thus allowing for changing , turning on , or turning off , from my recliner . Do n't let people trying to sell those `` sunshine '' lamps fool you . I tried one from Hammacher Schlemmer . Paid a good $ 40.00 more , and it was UN-USABLE . The glare on the TV and on reading material made me miserable and I had to have the light shade turned down completely to keep from blinding anyone else in the room . Check out something simple like this , instead , if you just want to be able to see to read . I 've gotten lots of compliments on its looks , too . 	Lamp
This is a good little product . The headlamp angle can be adjusted , so that it points straight ahead , or down at an angle . The light is bright and the headband is adjustable . It folds up very small and is very lightweight . I have it in my camera bag , but it can fit into a pocket . It opens easily and runs on 3 AAA batteries , which came with the headband . I think it is great for those times when you ca n't carry a flashlight in your hand and you need just a little quality light on the subject , but it would never replace a professional grade headlamp . 	Lamp
When I bought this lamp , I thought it was much taller than it is . Because of the size and the little light that it puts out , it is almost worthless for me to use . If I could I would return it and get my money back . However , I threw away the invoice and box it came in . Anne Gangwere 	Lamp
I bought this lamp to do crafts sewing , knitting etc without sitting under a full size lamp , it gave good light with 9 led bulbs , but the dangerous part is the strong smell of formaldehyde , moth balls , gasoline or some such chemical that gave me a headache and made my eyes sting ! washed the straps and outer casing , stuck it in a box with baking soda even , the odor will not go away . Could smell it throughout the house , so threw it out because it may be dangerous to inhale those fumes . Maybe try another brand , because they are useful for all sorts of projects . 	Lamp
Actually , the $ 8.20 price is probably the biggest drawback to this lamp . It was so inexpensive that I kept thinking it CANT really be that good . So I bought several other lamps that were three times the price and were very ineffective and didnt last long . Then I went back to amazon and bought this lamp . When it arrived , I was shocked at how great it looks and how wonderful it works . I like to keep my computer room relatively dark and this is the perfect lamp to light up the keyboard . I 'm buying a few extras as gifts and for other uses around the house . 	Lamp
I received the headlamp yesterday and returned it today . Once the three provided batteries were installed , the latch for the battery compartment would pop open whenever the tilt was adjusted . In my opinion , the battery compartment is designed too small . For a premium product , this was disappointing . 	Lamp
It works very well . The light is gives is incredible . I use it now , instead of a flashlight . 	Lamp
Bessey 3\/4 H-Style pipe clamps are great . They 're make out of cast iron , solid , durable , look like they 'll last a life time . I order two of these , one of them have a not so flat clamping surface , I 'm a little OCD , so I 'll return this and get a replacement . I 'll upload a picture that show this defect . The other one is perfectly flat , so perhaps i just got one from a bad batch . When I was looking for pipe clamps , I was considering this Bessey H-Style and the Rockler Sure-Foot . I picked these two brand because of the raised feet that allow the handle to clear the ground . I bought two of the Bessey and two of the Rockler . Both clamps are very similar -LRB- well they 're pipe clamp , what else do you expect -RRB- . Both are of good quality but here 's the some differences between the two for those in the same boat that I was and wondering which one to get . I 'll upload a couple pictures of the clamps side by side for your visual comparison . Main Differences : \* Bessey clamp 's feet are a little longer -LRB- 3\/8 '' -RRB- . Ground clearance -LRB- measure from the top of the pipe -RRB- . 3 '' for Bessey , 25\/8 '' for Rockler . I 'll probably glue some 3\/8 '' thick piece of wood underneath my Rockler clamp to bring the ground clearance up to the same level of the Bessey . \* Clamping surfaces : Bessey : 13\/4 -LRB- width -RRB- x 15\/8 -LRB- height -RRB- . Rockler : 13\/4 -LRB- width -RRB- x 21\/4 -LRB- height -RRB- . the clamping surface of the Rockler is a 3\/8 taller . I prefer this . Rockler clamps also seem to have better finish , the clamping surface is smoother and flatter . I have 3 of the Bessey clamp and two of them do not have very flat & smooth clamping surfaces . Would it make a different in clamping ? probably not . \* Bessey come with rubber cover for the clamping surface to protect your work . Rockler cheap out on this and sell the rubber cover separately -LRB- come on Rockler -RRB- . Not really a big deal for me though . I 'm sure I can find a piece of rubber somewhere in the house and tape it on . Similarity : \* raise , wide , stable footing . \* handle clear the ground for easy tightening . \* smooth clamping action . In conclusion , I think these are best pipe clamping currently available . Both Bessey H Style & Rockler Sure-foot are good clamps , ca n't go wrong w \/ either . I do like the finish of Rockler clamp better so I give it 5 versus 4 for the Bessey clamp . 	Lamp
Sadly , this does n't work . So disappointing . Sending it back . I think the soft button design to turn it on is a bad design . 	Lamp
I am a little disappointed in this . It does the job so far but it 's cheap looking compared to my halogen floor lamp it was replacing . I found another model at Home Depot costs a little more that I like better but I 'll keep this in the spare room for as long as it lasts . 	Lamp
Great littlt lamp !! I bought several and gave two away . I am holding-on to use them when we have one of those infrequent , but annoying power outages during the storm season. , or when we go camping . The batteries are said to last for 15 hrs . . It gives a VERY BRIgHT light . You will be surprised ! Get more than one and have batteries on hand . . 	Lamp
This product is excellent . It is what is stated : a desk lamp . From the negative reviews and after receiving the lamp , I think those who do not like it , wanted a table lamp . It is natural light so does have some glare , but I think natural light is better than artificial lighting , when working at a DESK ! Aloha , D 	Lamp
I received the item in a fair amount of time although when it arrived it did n't work . I tried it in several different outlets with several different light bulbs and nothing . All the bulbs and outlets worked with other lamps of course . Having the lamp show up and not work is very disappointing . The wire which ran the whole length from bulb to the floor looked fine but hey I am not an electrician . I am the person who gets to wait it out for a refund after taking this apart repacking it and then get it shipped . Not what I had in mind when I made the purchase . Also the lamp looks ok in the picture but it is n't made well , had I seen it in a store I would n't have paid more than maybe $ 29.99 . 	Lamp
Having run through a number of headlamps over the years , I say `` ditto '' to the other 5 star reviews about the PT Tactical Quad . I could n't be happier , this is an awesome product with a smart design . 	Lamp
overall , this headlamp is designed well and operates well . the only two complaints i have is with the red filter . when the red lens cover is snapped over the white leds , there is a small light gap and not all red light is seen . also , its very challenging to find the tab in which enables you to add \/ remove the red lens . if you plan on using this primarily for the red light , i would n't recommend this headlamp . 	Lamp
I gave this as a Christmas gift . He loved it , keeps it in his pocket at all times and uses it frequently , not only for camping but anytime he needs a flashlight . That way both hands are free . 	Lamp
The LEDs have two settings , low and high . The light rotates several agrees up and down to make it easy to use while working or reading , for example . The head strap expands quite a bit , even big enough to fit my big melon . It is lightweight so you do n't feel you need to have the head strap on too tight which would make it too uncomfortable to wear . Great product at a great price . 	Lamp
Lamp housing different from original , would not work in my TV . Did n't want to disassemble and use original housing since you pay for the housing . 	Lamp
works great and exactly as described . Very useful for camping and recreational activities . Also just handy to have for car repairs if u have something go wrong at a late hour . I use it while kayaking , camping and hiking . Great bang for buck . Put my friends headlamp to shame while hiking . Almost didnt even need his on , this one took the cake . I have another flashlight that i use for spotting things that are alot further away . So i suggest getting a mate for this , like i do . my only negative is that the flap is very small and hard to put down and up with big fingers , but you get used to it quickly . Red light is perfect for looking for something in your tent at night without blinding someone . good buy 	Lamp
my mother purchased this lamp for me and I use it frequently . It really illuminates an area and is a great reading lamp . Unfortunetly my daughter was recently sent home from school with the dreaded lice . This lamp was the next best thing to natural sunlight when it came to searching her hair for nits . The school is looking into purchasing the lamp for their head checks . I dont know what I would have done with out it . Highly recommended . 	Lamp
I ordered the Sony part according to my TV model . This said this was the matching part for my TV , but when I went to install it my TV would not work . I compared the two old and new lamps and noticed the new one had a different metal piece on top of it . Now I am back to square one to search for a lamp that will fit my 3 year old Sony TV . I am sending this one back . 	Lamp
Comfortable and lightweight , doesnt seem to bounce around while running , which I was afraid of . Pretty bright on high setting , enough to see where you 're going on a dark trail or street . I 'd probably recommend the more powerful models if you routinely travel through very dark areas like wooded trails . I 'd say it lights up about 25 feet in front of you . Economy setting is pretty useless . It 's not very bright . If you 're out at dusk , the strobe setting is more useful so cars can better see you . Would give it 5 stars if it had a little strip to block the light from going right into my eyes , affecting my vision and giving me a headache . 	Lamp
Bought this lamp just over six months ago and immediately after the 6 month warranty was done the lamp went bad , do not trust lamps from LAMPS Direct LLC . 	Lamp
Starting with the shipping - Shipped and arrived very quickly . Packaging - I ordered two of these lamps and both were very well indivudually wrapped and packaged . Both boxes were inside a bigger box that was very well sealed . All boxes were easy to open and removing the items from the boxes was a breeze . All items were intact . Assembly - The assembly of the lamps was very simple . It took my husband about 30 minutes to assemble both lamps . With the exception of a knife\/scissors ... no tools are nessesary . My lamps did not come with the light bulbs for the bigger lamp , but did include the bulbs for the smaller lamp . I love the look and the color , very nice . I would recommend this item . 	Lamp
We have two other B&H Sunlight lamps and love the great light they provide . One is a desk lamp next to our computer and is indispensable . We also love our other floor lamp . Perfect for any hand work , knitting or crochet , and for reading , too . 	Lamp
I purchased this lamp after seeing other hand appliquers using and recommending it at a symposium . I particularly like it because the base slides up under my sofa between the sofa and a lamp table . When not in use I can swing the arm over the lamp table . The best feature it that the light does not shine in my husband 's eyes while we are watching tv . The magnification and the lighting are perfect . I am so pleased I bought it ! 	Lamp
I use this headlamp on the Texas Gulf Coast in a high salinity and humid environment . The headband is very comfortable and the light has functioned flawlessly for several years . I would purchase another one if needed . 	Lamp
this product is not worth a dime , cheaply made , I would not recommend this to any one I do n't think Amazon knew just how bad this product is . the pole would not tighten up to the base , very unsteady 	Lamp
There is a salt lamp store near us that sells this same lamp for $ 49.99 . I saved a lot of money ordering through Amazon . 	Lamp
Bought this to read in bed without disturbing my husband . It is great so long as you adjust it properly on your head . Comfortable adjustable strap and strong light . Discovered it is really great for walking after dark too ! It throws a large , long light . 	Lamp
I 've just gotten the headlamp out of the box and working , and so far everything looks great . I love the compact design , and the super efficient retractable strap . It allows me to put it around just about any part of my body for effortless use . And it 's surprisingly comfortable ! I can almost see myself forgetting it was there after a while . I can see this being a really great feature during my upcoming hikes . I 've only turned it on in my house , and not in complete darkness , so I ca n't review the light properly yet , but from what I can see I think it will do just fine . I 'll update this after my trip with the full review ! : -RRB- 	Lamp
This headlamp is a replacement for the same one that I got for x-mas like 6 or 7 years ago . At the time , I think it was one of the best ones on the market . I was always using those $ 20 versions but they dont last and they are not balanced well . The first thing I found with this headlamp was that the batteries were in the back - so batteries in the back , lamp in the front = balanced . The lights work awesome - whatever setting you choose , depending on what I was doing , I would use diffrent settings . I used to a ton , working on my house at night sometimes I wouldnt even turn on any lights , just use the headlamp . I 'm going to say I used it more than the average fellow , working , playing , grilling , cleaning out my worktruck at night for the next day , lots of times . Anyways , I am getting another one because my first one is worn out after my heavy use of it . The light still works although I think the LEDs are a little dimmer than when it was new , but the real reason is that the elastics finally wore out and I cant tighten them up anymore to fit snug on my head which I think is a pretty awesome product . And when I got the first one , I think it was like 75-80 $ , and this new replacement\/same product was about $ 45 . But one !!! 	Lamp
We were grossly disappointed that this replacement lamp did n't work and thus , our 60-inch TV still did not work . The lamp is an expensive part , and we hoped to not have to contact a TV repair shop to remedy the situation . However , we ended up having to do just that . Luckily , the replacement lamp cost was just a bit more than the one we ordered on Amazon . Of course , we had to pay a trip cost and labor for the TV repair company . The silver lining was that we were fully reimbursed by Amazon after we followed the proper steps to send the lamp back . It 's the hassle of the extra time and expense we encountered that 's frustrating . For this kind of lamp , we 'll be hesitant to order online in the future . 	Lamp
Neither Sears or the TV Manufacturer , Toshiba were able to get me this lamp for 27 days from the day I requested a replacement . I made the order through Amazon , paying overnight delivery and had it the next day . It is a Toshiba lamp that took less than five minutes to install . 	Lamp
Its cute , but will be really cute when I get finished putting my personal touch to it ! 	Lamp
I bought this on Ebay . It seems like everything made in China these days is getting cheaper and this is no exception . Cheap , cheap construction feels like if you drop it or bang it against something it will just break apart . It lights ok when it decides to turn on , but I do n't think it 's going to last . More of a novelty than anything else . Come on USA we have to start producing more instead of importing this kind of crap . 	Lamp
This is a beautiful lamp , and it just changed the look of my living room . The reddish Orange glow inside the mesh shades is indeed very cool . It has a very contemporary look . I have a metal wall art painting in my living room and I am pointing one of the shades towards it , and it just perfectly highlights the art work . Highly recommended . Oh , and it was delivered within 2 days . . free shipping : -RRB- 	Lamp
It works . Easy to install . Lamps are affordable again . Keeping my old lamp for a backup as it had almost 8,000 hours on it . With the new lamp , I do n't need to use it on Dynamic mode anymore . 	Lamp
Really excellent . Grips just tight enough to stay on when moving around quickly , but is also quite comfortable . It pulls itself into a neatly-wrapped package , saving you from storing\/carrying difficulties . I 'm not sure why you would want a strobe function on your headlamp , but if you do , it 's got one . 	Lamp
Great lamp for the visually impaired . Twelve LED bulbs put a huge amount of light on a book or magazine or needlework project . Excellent magnification . Superior to older lamps which used a circular fluorescent , which put out far less light . 	Lamp
I was really excited about purchasing this lamp . It is an amazon prime item and I was thrilled with how quickly it came -- I was in the midst of studying for finals in my very poorly lit apt . so I appreciated the promptness . The lamp , however , was a huge disappointment and I almost immediately decided to return it . It is not particularly lumnious -- it is more like a fluorescent spotlight . Because the lamp is so short , it needs to be right on your desk above your papers in order for the spotlight to even be useful . I returned this item and opted to go get a stand up lamp instead . disappointing . 	Lamp
What a great experience ! Ordered the bulb on Tuesday and received it on Thursday before 2pm . The bulb came in an original Sony box and is an original Sony product just as described . The box DID include the bulb in the housing not just the bulb like others said . I recommend This vendor to anyone looking for great fast service ! Thanks again ; -RRB- 	Lamp
This thing works great , comes with 3 AAA batteries , open package , put int he batteries and play . Has a bright , low and strobe light function . The strobe function is n't really good for anything , but maybe if you were trying to signal someone if you were lost or something . The color is cool and it fits well . Would buy another one , but really one is all that 's needed I guess . 	Lamp
The projector bulb was exactly as advertised . It is the upgraded , newer and better phillips bulb . The case and directions made the installation very easy . 	Lamp
The switch failed after just a few uses . The light refuses to stay on . The headlamp was not abused in any way . 	Lamp
straps are really comfortable . and the light is really bright . however to get it to use all 9 lights you have to press the button 3 times ! pointless ! there should just be an on off switch for all the lights . the light sits on a stand that will allow you to bend it down to see lower than where it would sit , but if you are useing this for anything other than reading books it bends down with evry bump in the road . in time you will have to invest in tape so it wil stay up . the worst thing about this light is that it wont allways turn on !!! and then when it does , when bumped it will shut off ! and you have to spin the botton tso that it turns on again ! i would not buy this product again . 	Lamp
I bought these to use in my classroom so that it would create and atmosphere of quiet when we were doing silent reading and the overhead lights were off . I bought rechargeable batteries to make them cost effective and environmentally friendly . 	Lamp
I use this for walking the dog at night . I can reach up easily to press the button to see into the distance or press it on to pick up after the pooch . I do n't leave it on all the time . Great reach and easy to press . Comfortable to wear . 	Lamp
THE SHIPPERS HAD THIS LAMP DELIVERED WITHIN DAYS OF ORDER . IT 'S A GREAT LOOKING LMAP GIVES OFF GREAT LIGHT -LRB- BUT SOFT -RRB- AND LOOK FANTASTIC . . THANK YOU SO MUCH - 	Lamp
Echoing what another reviewer said , the pivot point is made out of plastic . Due to this fact , the lamp loses its ability to grip onto the pivot point as the plastic wears down . Mine is at the point -- after four or five times out running -- where it has to be either completely up and facing forward or it will flop down and point directly at my feet . Neither of these positions is useful for running as a straight forward position puts the light too far for running , and straight down simply blinds me and does n't shoot the light far enough forward . I would expect this problem to exist for other applications as well if you have to lean forward . Do not buy this product . I now have to put a piece of plastic behind the lamp and use a rubber band to hold the lamp against the plastic . This allows it to point down slightly , but it looks even more ridiculous . Definitely not worth the money . 	Lamp
As we all age , , our eyesight needs more and more light to focus well . This SUNLIGHT Lamp has made my reading and crossword puzzles easy and fun again . Even on the gloomiest day . It can be positioned to many angles and is economical to use . This Floor Lamp with a SUNLIGHT Bulb is really amazing . 	Lamp
I occasionally need some small c-clamps for projects around the house . Quality seemed quite good . Tightened smoothly and easily . Nice because much cheaper than available in local stores . Fully satisfied . 	Lamp
This is the first headlamp I 've had . It is very comfortable to wear and adjusts easily . I use it to run trails with a group of runners and it lights up the trail better than most of the lights used . It will light up enough of the trail that runners who forget their 's run with me because they can see . 	Lamp
This Petzl headlamp has worked well for me for many years . I was in the Army as an Infantryman and every infantryman in my unit was issued this headlamp . I have took this headlamp all across the country through numerous training events from 4 days to over 30 days . I also took this headlamp on deployment to Iraq for 15 months . The `` white '' light on this unit is well enough in dark situations for the individual user and not too blinding . The `` red '' light flip down or up tab works well and still gives off enough light to see up close and not give off a bright glow of `` white '' light for people who are in a light discipline enviroment . The battery life is also efficient . 	Lamp
They look completely real . Everybody 's amazed and I never even tell them that their fake . It 's a great compliment to any room , and they should n't call it a toy , it looks and basically is an aquarium 	Lamp
This is the first headlamp I have ever purchased . I liked the fact that you did not have to wear it on your head - it has a retractable `` cord '' so you can use it in different ways . I think the light is bright enough -LRB- 40 lumens -RRB- and it is very compact . There are two different brightness settings , plus a flashing light as well . I 've used it on two camping trips and it worked great . Very satisfied with the purchase . 	Lamp
This task lite is durable and works extremely well . As a designer I value `` true lighting '' and this light does the trick perfectly . I 've purchased several of these over the years and they are truly terrific . 	Lamp
I purchased this item for running out in the country where it is very dark before the sun comes up . This headlamp lights my way VERY well and I absolutely love it . I wish I had not waited so long to purchase this because it has really extended my outdoor running season . If you really need something to light your way , this is the product for you . I would highly recommend it ! 	Lamp
This floor lamp is out standing for any room of the house . The lighting is sufficent for reading or any activity that one might want to pursue that require lighting without straining your eyes . I would recommend it to anyone ! 	Lamp
It was difficult for me to see my needlepoint project as my eyes are 68 years old . With this magnifier lamp , it was like the needle point was on `` steroids . '' I can see the stitches crystal clear , and also thread the needle with no effort . It sits beside my easy chair and adjusts perfectly . 	Lamp
These are about the best clamps I 've used . Totally rigid and just the right size -LRB- for my use anyway -RRB- . They are far better than plastic clamps . I 'm really quite impressed with them . 	Lamp
The gear is very comfortable and well built . The red light does not attract many species of flying bugs , this makes it especially helpful in summer night fishing . The only con is that the flap of the red filter is tiny and hard to flip down , I have to repeat trying to get it down . 	Lamp
First bulb lasted 12 days past the warranty , approx 600 hrs on bulb . Contacted electrifed they made good on the warranty . Now how long will this one last ? So far I 'm satisfied . would have given 5 stars if it had lasted longer . 	Lamp
Due to limited light supply on our Catalina 30 - this nifty little lamp allows me to read in comfort - without draining the battery on our boat . It 's also handy for when walking in unfamiliar territory . I bring it on all my travels as well - I do n't leave home without it ! 	Lamp
Went through 3 of three lamp over a span of 4 years . This one lasted 5 months . It was the last penny being put in the DLP . Spent the money on a new tv . For those wanting to buy one . It worked well for the months it lasted and evan improved the picture quit a bit , but it blew up like the rest . 	Lamp
Good clamps ! I bought several for gluing furniture and cutting boards , and these have been perfect through many hours of use so far . I especially like the feet . They allow the clamps to sit level on the surface during glue up . I 've also been impressed by the rubber pads . Other clamps do n't always come fitted with rubber pads , and sometimes when they do , they 're not very durable . These pads have been solid though . 	Lamp
I have bought twenty dollar flashlights before and this is significantly brighter . The packaging says something like 125 hour battery life . Have n't had it that long , but I 'm hopeful . Overall it will be a great addition to my camp pack . 	Lamp
The add says and I quote '' SONY XL-2400 Replacement Lamp '' By the way it is written one would believe it would be a SONY lamp well quess what it is not a SONY Lamp but a cheap knock off . If you want the real thing stay away from this vendor you wo n't get what you ordered . At least they could say that this bulb was not an orignal SONY lamp but a replacement lamp . 	Lamp
When my samsung DLP is flickering with 3 lights in front , i opened the rear panel of tv and notice the lamp fuze out . I was under debate to buy new Led tv or replace bulb -LRB- thinking bulb cost 300 bucks -RRB- . While browsing around in amazon found the equivalent bulb for 60 bucks . shipping was 5 days -LRB- free -RRB- and replaced the bulb easily . Picture is perfect more glowy and more over it saves me 2000 dollars . 	Lamp
Excellent product ! A must have ! Helps out in so many ways ! 	Lamp
This is perfect if you are pilot and need some additional lighting . Its bright white LEDs give you plenty of light to do your preflight on the darkest of nights . With a simple loop around the yoke , flip down the red filter and you now have a in cockpit light to read your charts on your knee board or provide emergency illumination of the instruments . 	Lamp
We are avid rock collectors and our friend 's daughter was fascinated by our collection . I got this as a gift for her eighth birthday and she was thrilled . Not only a large specimen mineral , but a light as well , and the dimmer switch made it better then ours . 	Lamp
Exactly as described . Exactly what I was looking for . They look true to picture and are true to dimensions . They look very nice . I love them ! 	Lamp
I bought this for my husband for Christmas . He likes these kind of flashlights for camping and outdoorsy things . The light is very bright and works well . The batteries seem to have a long life . The settings are very basic -- no fancy gadgets or special stuff . We 're very satisfied with this product . It would work well for bicycling , camping , hiking , shooting , etc. . 	Lamp
I received the replacement lamp very quickly - about 3 days after I placed the order . The replacement installed easily . However , I 've notice that after a week , the screen will be fuzzy , not full color , at the initial start up . Then at about 30 to 40 second point -LRB- after start up -RRB- , the screen is fine , -LRB- full color - clear , etc -RRB- . I did have two incidences in the past week where it will start , go about 10 seconds , then shut down completely and the `` lamp '' indicator flashes . I hit the power button again , and it worked okay . I read other reviews about other lamp replacements and think that the replacement I got may NOT be suitable substitute , and may be stressing a ballast and therefore causing the erratic lamp behavior . If it just amounts to me waiting a few more seconds and the screen is fine , then I 'm fine . If it ends up not working after a few more weeks , then I 'd say this was a failure due to a inferior replacement part . 	Lamp
This product did not work out of the box . I tried installing this lamp several times and either my tv would come on normal for about 20-30 seconds and go out , or the red light would just flash and screen would not light up at all . I had to take the lamp cases apart and put the new lamp in my old case . Works fine now . The metal tabs on the front of the case are slightly different . I feel i was hosed out of $ 20 because i could have bought just the lamp without the case for 20 cheaper . I think this product is misleading they make it look like it is a factory sony replacement but yet it would not work in my sony tv . I also read other reviews that had the same problem , figured if there was a problem it would have been fixed by now . 	Lamp
Lamp is great , I will think twice before buying from this seller again , their shipping methods are a little odd . 	Lamp
I LOVE this lamp ! I was n't expecting it to be as nice as it was but I loved it so much , I ordered a second one two days after I got it ! 	Lamp
This headlamp is identical to the E49P except it 's camoflauge instead of black . The brightness of this headlamp is amazing . I love the red filter for night hikes or just so I do n't blind other people -LRB- or myself when trying to save night vision -RRB- . The headlamp is light -LRB- only 78 grams w \/ batteries -RRB- and also extremely comfortable and stable on my head . The battery life is unbeatable , ranging from 100-150 hours on 3 AAA batteries . I ca n't find a thing wrong with this headlamp other than it 's not 100 % waterproof , but it is water resistant . For this price , I think the Tac Tikka Plus is easily the best . 	Lamp
I work security on third shift . Some of the buildings I have to check are in darkness . The Petzl E49P TacTikka Plus 4-LED Headlamp works great . It illuminates a large area and frees my hands for checking doors to make sure they are secure . 	Lamp
THIS PRODUCT WAS EXACTLY WHAT I WAS LOOKING FOR TO DO MY CROSS STITCHING PROJECTS . THE LIGHT IS BRIGHT AND THERE ARE NO SHADOWS ON MY WORK . I AM EXTREMELY SATISFIED WITH THIS SUNLAMP . IT DOES N'T GET HOT LIKE MY HALOGEN LAMP DID . 	Lamp
The item arrived on the early part of the shipping range -LRB- ~ 5 days -RRB- . It fit properly and has worked for a few weeks so far . No quality problems have been noted . The price was good . 	Lamp
I replaced the lamp in my tv with the same one I took out . I did n't want to test an after market lamp . It was easy to replace and so far , it works great . 	Lamp
I fish the unforgiving rock piles of NJ , pretty much getting wet most of the time with waves crashing over the rocks and getting salt spray in my face . This thing claims to be water resistant , but it is not . After using it one time , the battery terminals corroded and the light is not working properly . If you are planning on being dry the whole time , than its a great lamp . Very light weight , the red lens is perfect for keeping your night vision , its just not good for surf fishing . 	Lamp
I REALLY LIKE THIS LAMP AND IT LIGHTWEIGHT SO CAN BE EASILY MOVED IF I WANT IT IN A DIFFERENT LOCATION 	Lamp
I purchased this lamp replacement back in July '10 and it just went out . It did not even last 6 months . I tried writing the distributor and they are no longer on the Amazon platform . How convenient !!! Very upset ! 	Lamp
Even our 3 yr old g ` daughter needs to have this to find her things under the bed . This is not only good for the miners but this is so helpful when having to work in dark areas and still have 2 hands to work with . You wo n't have to worry about dropping this and being left in the dark . -LRB- only if the battery runs out -RRB- 	Lamp
This IKEA lamp was just what I was looking for . The shade looks like rice paper , but in fact is a sturdy plastic material that will not tear . Very convenient and easy to put together , even for us seniors !!! Looks great ! 	Lamp
It was heavy ! My husband had assembled a bookcase the day before we got this and had a lot of trouble keeping the board from moving and getting it right . When he did one with this clamp , it took half the time ! So much easier ! And the second bookcase was bigger . WE are building six bookcases to put into a corner of the room . What a good investment ! Sure it is n't perfect , but once you get the hang of it , it made assembly a breeze . 	Lamp
I actually have the takterra , same thing but it has a flip down red lens . This lamp has served in multiples combat tours in Iraq and has been completely reliable . Battery life is ultra long , I think In the past year I have changed them once . Cant go wrong 	Lamp
I love the look of the Jukebox lamp but its not what the description says . I had bought it because it said it had a docking station and it charges up the ipod touch . It does n't . It takes awhile for the radio to turn on . I love the look especially for a teenage boys room . 	Lamp
I had a friend , years ago , who had something similar to this and I 've always wanted one . Now that I 'm getting older and my eyes are not as good as they used to be it 's been a constant source of frustration that I could not see to thread a needle or do embroidery . With this I can do everything I used to do . It really is well designed . Stands at just the right height to use sitting down but is very adjustable , light is a good intensity , magnification excellent . The only thing you need to be careful of is to make sure you have the lamp hanging over the base -LRB- both going the same direction -RRB- or else the weight of the lamp could cause it to tip over . Not a big deal really , just something to be aware of . 	Lamp
I 'm an Electrician and I just used this light on a service replacement job . It worked great . The fact that it 's on my head is perfect , the fact that the battery life is phenomenal , is perfect and the fact that it 's super bright makes this a winner for the professional . I have 2 ; one for me and one for my helper . Do n't bother with handheld flashlights if you need to use your hands . I 'm going to get one for my Nephew as a gift , he 's also in the Trade . 	Lamp
This is a good quality clamp . Well made and has a comfortable grip . I am using it with a kreg pocket hole jig jr. so they are designed to work together . It was very easy to secure the jig onto the end of a 2x4 . Looking forward to more projects with this tool . 	Lamp
Received the bulb that I ordered today . It 100 % DOES absolutely have the word `` Sony '' on the outside of the box and it 100 % IS absolutely in the enclosure , not just the raw bulb . My Sony owners manual specifies that we replace our original bulb with a Sony XL-5200 bulb . There is no mention whatsoever of the word `` Philips '' in the Sony owners manual . Thanks to all you `` experts ... '' 	Lamp
Arrived in 2 days , great price and was an original Sony replacement part . TV back working in 10 minutes . Thanks ! 	Lamp
I took this to walk my dog and it ROCKS . the leds are extremely bright , casting a nice solid beam , and it lights up the peripherals well . i 'm gonna get like 4 of these camping and wear all of them with two surefire flashlights in both hands and go crazy . this is a great product . u wo n't be disappointed buying one or five .

"The major difference between this and Kreg 's original version -LRB- still available -RRB- is the handle padding , though this version does away with the inner vice-grip release lever also -LRB- it 's not really necessary -RRB- . For the same money , you might as well buy these for the extra comfort , particularly if you are doing a lot of carcasses . As I said in my review of the original , there is simply no substitute for these , and they work exceptionally well . The original may be found here : <ahref=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00009OLD3/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/186-6538714-6209852""> Kreg RAC Right Angle Clamp </a> "	Lamp
This bulb fit into our 65 '' Toshiba perfectly . It took all of five minutes to swap out the bulb . I highly recommend having a can of Dust Off compressed air so you can clean off the dust you 'll find . We 've had it about a month without any problems . 	Lamp

I have been searching for backup batteries for a while . I have purchased a few , Energizer Power to Go 4000 and the Black and Decker 100W power to go and this one . The Symtek is the cheapest , has the most battery charge and versatility . There is virtually no info or reviews on it , but it is great . I was trying to find the actual battery capacity , but it is not available anywhere . This has a USB port and a port to charge laptops using the different tips . Note it does not have the magsafe charger tip for newer macbooks\/pro . I tried contacting the company , but they have not responded . I discovered you can easily make a tip using a replacement charging cable from ebay , one of the unused tips in this package and a little soldering . Using this to run a netbook , I got about 3 hours . Using it to run a notebook computer I got about 2 hours . While you can run the computer , it will NOT charge the battery . It is easily able to charge my iPhone 4 several times , but it is only a 5mA USB output port , so it is a bit slow to charge . When it is running on its last few minutes the battery starts a very audible beeping sound to let you know you are almost out a juice . I did n't test to see it completely drained , but it ran for 3 minutes of beeping before I unplugged it . Its got four blue lights to let you know the approximate battery level . It will go from empty to fully charged in about 2-3 hours . It has a wall charger with several world plugs , a car cigarette lighter adapter and a airplane adapter so you have many charging choices . You have pretty much all the tips you can ever need except for the apple magsafe one -LRB- from what I researched , Apple is not letting anyone else make these -RRB- . The manual says you can contact the company for any additional tips . With all the tips you can get creative on what to use this for . I use this to power my mobile entertain unit which consists of a pico projector -LRB- video output -RRB- , iPhone 4 -LRB- video source -RRB- and speakers -LRB- audio output -RRB- . This battery triples my battery running time . Its pretty lightweight and small for what it does . The size is about that of a portable hard drive . I bought it here for $ 27 when the brand name equivalents are running for $ 100 more . This is my first review and I hope it was helpful . 	Laptop
Purchased in July used maybe a total of 10 times . Modem dies they replaced shipping was at my expense , also replaced something else I had not a problem with , but then again it was returned filthy , with keyboard ware , scratched , not in original box , serial # taped over looking like NOT MY MACHINE !! Sent back for battery replacement , and scratch & filth and returned without replacing the battery they switched out my machine with another . Battery died after 3 times it was turned on for 5-10 min . They will not return any e-mails . Will not acknowledge . DO NOT BUY FROM THIS COMPANY !! wrote to best by where I purchased 2 xs now and no responce from them either . Posted on eBay with high buy it now price to get the word out and hope they buy it back from me which they will not respond to . Going to go through my credit card co. which you can request credit on purchase not what you expected . I 'll try anything as I 'm out 1079.95 !! And months of lost time and back ups . I have photos to show changed stickers on serial # and model # code differance and tape . Also saved all coorispondance from them to have if not repaired so I 'd have a case . I think we all need to find someone to file class action law suit !! 	Laptop
I am surprised by the number of positive reviews and the high score that this item received . Perhaps they were predominantly written just after purchase . At that time , my feelings were warm as well , albeit not as warm as the laptop itself after a few minutes of use . After one year of not-too-intensive use , I am unhappy . The batteries died out almost instantly . When my students saw me coming with it to give a lecture , they immediately started asking questions about poor batteries ... And technical support in case of a problem ? Totally incompetent . After many calls and contradictory pieces of advice , one thing has been clarified : the `` part number '' shown on the back of the laptop is incorrect ! Do n't buy unless you like endless and meaningless conversations with incompetent tech reps. 	Laptop
Plugged it in and the volume was like nada . Thought , wow did we did burned on this . Unplugged it and realized there was a volume dial that I had n't seen . Plugged it in and used the volumn dial and it was very loud but adjustable . The volume on my wife 's laptop is poor at best turned all the way up so this was a nice add on . Note : we both said that this could be a great christmas gift to those who have ipads , etc. . No I do n't work for the company or I would n't admit to being so stupid I did n't know it had a volume dial . 	Laptop
I have had this same laptop for over a year and just bought another one for my dad . The fact that I purchased another one should say it all . I just wish this one had a built-in aircard , but other than that , I 'm pretty happy with it . 	Laptop

I am always anxious purchasing a third-party battery instead of the OEM ; the savings is 2\/3 or more ; so most of us do take that risk . LaptopMate shipped promptly . The Anker Li-ion replacement battery for my 6 year old Dell 700M notebook , based on a few weeks of service , is performing perfectly . It holds a charge as it should . The Dell charger re-charges the Anker ; there is no sign of overheating . The battery is around 3\/4 '' wider than the original ; and the electrical capacity is 2X the original . The added width is not a problem ; the 700M fits in its carrying case without problem . I will purchase from LaptopMate again . 	Laptop
I bought this for my Acer 11.6 '' Notebook . It fits perfectly and suites it 's purpose - it provides privacy . I travel quite a bit and the viewing angle is perfect for flights where people might get too close for comfort . CON : the fasteners are a little odd . If you have a bezel , the clear plastic fasteners are awkward and unsightly . But they work . Overall - great screen for the price and if you can manage the fasteners , you 'll be the only one looking at your screen moving forward ! 	Laptop
Yes it appears flimsy , but it made the trip to work , without being in a case , in one piece . It also survived my son fidgeting with the fans . The fan cools adequately . The sizze little small for my laptop , but as long as I move it to the left of center , it keeps it cool enough . The slant is perfect . It is sturdy and does n't move around , nor does the laptop -LRB- even when it is off center and not using the computer 's `` feet '' -RRB- . I love the USB pass through , although it is upside down . It is made to go on the left side , but the cord comes out towards the front . It would n't be a problem at all , but my other USB port is right next to it . My much more expensive fan did not have the pass through it said it was supposed to come with , and I miss it even more now . This fan is relatively quiet , just loud enough for me to know it is on without become intrusive . 	Laptop
Hace meses que estaba esperando que a la Serie P25 la proveyeran de todas las caracter&iacute;sticas para hacerla realmente una m&aacute;quina equilibrada en s&iacute; misma .

Otro acierto fue incorporarle el nuevo software Windows Media Center 2004 , que hace m&aacute;s amigable y fiable el ver y grabar programas de tv . Como arquitecto , al trabajar con software que necesitan de tecnolog&iacute;a de mucho poder para poder renderear las im&aacute;genes de los proyectos que dise & ntilde ; o , esta laptop es realmente &uacute;til a mis necesidades .

If you 're looking for a sleeve for your 17 inch macbook pro you should get this . MacBooks are thin and thus often do n't fit larger covers as well .

Hello All , I ordered this a couple of weeks ago , but I just now got around to trying it out , my macbook pro gets pretty hot when watching videos online , so I watched about a half an hour of video , and I have to say that this cooling mat really did a good job at keeping the macbook cool , it usually heats up considerably more , than it did before using this mat . It also looks to be very well designed , I guess time will tell as far as its longevity . . hope this helped 	Laptop
I got this case because Apple did n't have any slip-cases of the right size when I bought my 11 '' Macbook Air . I 'm glad I got this one and not the `` official '' Incase one . This one was n't made specifically to fit the Macbook Air , but it fits well enough that I 'm confident carrying it around . I have n't had any problems with scratches or undue movement . The `` bubbles '' inside the case hold the Macbook Air firmly . The outside pocket is great for carrying around the myriad adapters and dongles you need with any Mac -LRB- mini-DP to VGA , USB to Ethernet , USB to PC headset -RRB- and the power brick . I like the orange color too . 	Laptop
This was just what I needed . The power cord for my laptop was not working . I thought I was going to have to replace the whole thing and get it directly from HP . However I found this and decided to try it . It works great . I did not have to rplace the whole thing just the section that was not working . I would definitely recommend this product . 	Laptop
I ordered it and did not receive the product , would n't recommend it for anyone and all of that . But I did get my money back when I told amazon about it 	Laptop
We purchased this for an 11.1 screen notebook and found that it is perfect with some breathing room for cords and peripherals , such as an external hard drive . There are a few different zip compartments which is great for organization and overall functionality . 	Laptop
It came in very good condition , as advertised . Works just like my old one . My only complaint is that it took longer than expected to arrive , but I know usps messed up , not amazon . 	Laptop
First of all , let me state that while I have used this machine , I am the current owner of an older model - the first generation 17 '' with a 1GHz processor and a 60GB hard drive . One of the biggest questions I always hear is `` Is n't that too big to carry around ? '' My answer is no. . I carry it for a 20 minute walk to my college campus daily and have no problems with it . I keep it in a Brenthaven bag specifically designed for it , and while it is a little unwieldy , it took me very little time to get used to it . The weight is definitely not an issue . For anyone thinking about getting this , I would weigh any bag that you carry with you on a day to day basis - seven pounds really is n't so much to deal with . I use my Powerbook as my primary machine . At any given time , I am usually running Adobe Photoshop and\/or Illustrator , Macromedia Flash , as well as a few native applications -LRB- Mail and iCal are always open , usually iTunes as well -RRB- . The programs that come with the computer are well integrated into the operating system . I use mine for about 15 hours a day , and I put it to sleep rather than shutting it down . Even with all of the work that I do on it , a year and a half after purchasing my model it still stays on for two to three weeks with no need to shut it down . The backlit keyboard is a feature that I never thought I would need , but now that I have it I 'm not sure how I ever lived without it . Light sensors automatically adjust your screen brightness and keyboard lighting , although these can be adjusted manually . It makes working a breeze . Even though I do n't look at the keyboard very much when I 'm typing , it 's nice to be able to see when I need to use keys I do n't access very often -LRB- function keys , etc. -RRB- . Since the keyboard lighting controls take up extra function keys , the `` one-key '' Expose features in OSX require one more step with pressing function before hitting F9-F11 , but if it poses a real problem you can always set screen corners or change the hot key . My biggest issue with this computer is the battery life . With the brightness turned all the way down -LRB- which can make the screen very difficult to see depending on your lighting conditions -RRB- and AirPort turned off , it can get around 3.5-4 hours of battery life . If you need full brightness and a wireless internet connection , you 're realistically looking at about 2-2 .5 hours of battery life . Overall , I am a large supporter of this computer . I would recommend it to anyone that has a need for a Macintosh with maximum screen size and portability . 	Laptop
Everything is padded fine , Lot 's of roomy space -LRB- I have a 17.3 in laptop -RRB- . Compartments are nice and plentiful . Only gripe I have is the handle , it looks like it could break over time . 	Laptop
Computer screen got to me right on time . Screen was packaged to make sure no damage could be done while in route to me . I was worried it would come with a scratch on the screen from the factory , but everything was perfect and it only took me a few minutes to remove the old screen and install the new screen . 	Laptop
This is a good replacement item -LRB- at a reasonable cost -RRB- . It is entirely compatible with the Dell Inspiron 1501 and is stamped with the Dell logo . Recommended for anyone needing a replacement . 	Laptop
This is worthless ! No louder than the built in speaker on my IPad . Stand is nice but this is a no-go . Still looking for an alternative . 	Laptop
Very impressed with sound quality and surprised at the ease of installation . You just plug it in and go with Windows 7 . It 's that simple . You will be able to use it as your main speaker as well , b\/c it can even reproduce bass pretty good . I do n't miss my regular speakers with these plugged in . This device is impressive . 	Laptop
According to Toshiba , this was the replacement battery for her laptop . However , it did not fit inside the battery compartment . It was too long and too wide . Thank goodness for Amazon 's return policy ! 	Laptop
This really came in handy especially for .90 cents It is nice to be able to still get accessories for older computers and these days older is one year old 	Laptop
first of all i did n't get the wristband ! They said in the packaging that there 's a mouse pad but all I saw was this huge ugly lint padded thing . I love the material of the sleeve , I 'm using this for college . 	Laptop
What can I say , the shipped what they displayed and it worked . Battery lasts between 1 - 2 depending on usage . Just as it did when it was new . Arrived fast . 2 days sooner then estimated . No problems . I WOULD recommends them . Karen 	Laptop
Great notebook ! I had been hesitant given varied posted experience with Averatec , but this thing is solid . I get about 3 hours battery life with wireless on , so the AMD Sempron processor does a great job with power management . Speed is no problem for general use such as web browsing , Word , Excel , etc. . Case is magnesium alloy , solid and nice looking . Wireless range is excellent with built in 802.11 b\/g NIC . Overall , very happy . 	Laptop
I shopped for a -LRB- under $ 1000 -RRB- notebook for my wife basically for her digital photos and her Girl Scout files , I was very disappointed in what the local stores had to offer . PROS : This laptop looks great , has a nice large keyboard , and the 15 inch XGA display is beautiful with up to 128MB shared memory ! The front 4-in-1 Media Card Reader is impressive and works flawlessly . It comes with only 512MB ram , but is easily upgraded with PC2700 type -LRB- 333mhz -RRB- 200-pin DDR memory . The AMD Processor is quick and pushes this laptop to achieve the desired results -LRB- photo editing and word processing -RRB- . I turned it the first time and within a few minutes I was already surfing the web as it easily found my router , and my network . The sound on this laptop is much better than all of the other similarly -LRB- and some higher -RRB- priced laptops I looked at . We watched a DVD the first night and had absolutely no complaints -LRB- and this was still using only the original 256MB of memory -RRB- ! Comes loaded with Roxio CD burning software and Microsoft Works 7.0 , and PowerDVD . CONS : A bit larger\/heavier than what I was originally shopping for , but I could n't pass up on the great deal . And at 6.8 lbs , it 's really not that heavy . The video is NOT for gaming ! But like I said , you 'll have no problems watching movies and if you use the S-Video -LRB- TV Out -RRB- Port on a flat screen ... WOW ! SUMMARY : We have nothing to complain about . All around great `` budget '' laptop . This laptop will do everything except render the latest games . What a Bargain ! 	Laptop
This unit does everything I needed it to do at a good price . Window 7 is a friendly OS that is very close in operation to my PC 's XP . This is a nice looking unit that shows no sign of being sold at a bargain price . The 15.6 inch screen is easy to see and large enough to be able to comfortably view a DVD without straining . No complaints on the emachine 527 . 	Laptop
I have an Acer aspire 5050 series laptop . This memory is `` supposed '' to be the correct speed . Its not . I installed both dimms , vista 32 read all 4gb . CRASH CRASH CRASH . I have the same issue Mac users do . . Must have one of the original dimms in to make the new 2gb chip to clock right . Since I installed 1 2gb dimm and left 1 512mb in , no issues . HIGHLY unhappy with PNY . NOT AMAZONS FAULT . Luckily , I have another ACER with 1 2gb factory dimm in it so i tossed my other new dimm in it and it works well . I would have liked this one to have 4gb but the memory gods say `` NO '' . Starts faster , and as you may know , Vista is a RAM HOG ! But things open and run a bit better . All In All - Memory does work , but apparently is not the clock speed it says it is -LRB- I have read its actually 800mhz -RRB- . I would suggest another supplier , NOT PNY . If you have experienced the same issues , let me know . Maybe I can still use both . If I can get them both working in this Acer Aspire 5050-3371 , then I will append this rating . 	Laptop
The memory does exactly what it is supposed to do . I can not say that it does more , nor have I had it do less . 	Laptop
I was worried when I ordered the bundle rather than just the backpack that I would be getting a different product , but the bundle -LRB- which included an optical mouse -RRB- was $ 20 cheaper and still included the same quality laptop bag . I am giving both away as gifts to separate individuals , and was still able to save a lot of money through the bundle . Great product . 	Laptop
I really like the carrying case for my macbook pro I received . I slip it in whenever I am not using the computer and it keeps it from getting scratched . It is nice and light weight and looks really good . I am very happy with my purchase . 	Laptop
I bought this battery for a laptop my dad is using back in India . As my friend was leaving to India in couple of days time I had to purchase it at the earliest . The previous battery was totally dead after working properly for 2 years . Right now what I see is the battery working really gr8 . I will be visiting India during end of the year so will review bak after seeing how it works btwn these days . 	Laptop
I bought this at the end of June my other computer charger It work get up till about two week ago when it start Falling apart the wire are being exposed and is not charging that well I will have to buy another one Do not like having to replace something I just replace a few months ago 	Laptop
I would just like to clarify that if you have a 17 inch or so laptop , the two fan is NOT big enough . When they say 17 inch , they really mean 16 inches and under . If you have a 17-18 inch laptop , go for the 19 inch . I 'm not really sure how it runs because I sent it back for a refund immediately after I saw its size . 	Laptop
This works just as well as the original . The only difference is that it is a 2-prong plug -LRB- it does n't have a grounding wire -RRB- . 	Laptop
I have a 19 inch gaming laptop i could n't find any chill pads that would fit my laptop and the one i use is for a 15 inch laptop so my pc will slip off the edge of it alot , I saw this and decided to buy it the reviews are what convinced me to buy , it looks great and it fits my laptop perfectly but the fan is alittle weak my old chill pad was a cheap one and it cooled about the same , I thought big fan even at low rpms would provide a good overall airflow to my pc but if the bottom of your laptop is not vented well in the center most of what little airflow it has will just glance off the bottom , overall the size is a plus but the fan would be better if it was 1000 rpms not 600 rpms , so if you have trouble finding a chill pad big enough for your laptop try this one but if your laptop is not vented well in the center and tends to run super hot try looking for something with alittle more speed . 	Laptop
The used Inspiron 700m I was assigned had the OEM battery that was on its last legs - 30 mins of usage before dying . laptopmate 's Anker battery was the solution I was looking for , and it fits PERFECT , looks just like the OEM battery , and best of all , I now get about 3 hrs of run time on a single charge . Thanks laptopmate for keeping some life in my laptop ! 	Laptop
Product arrived within ETA . The added memory improved the performance of my old Dell laptop . I am pleased with my purchase . 	Laptop
Product just a piece of flimsy plastic . Computer slid off , unit awkward to use , bought a much better , similar type unit at local dollar store for lower price ! 	Laptop
Arrived open box . The factory seal had been opened . This did not happen from bad glue . Pause on boot-up because of error message for non-existant slave drive . F2 resume took me to the bios set-up . MS Works was not installed . I do not know whether to exchange or just get refund . I would appreciate input from users . Only rely before February 5 . saildale@hotmail.com 	Laptop
Well this being the 3rd yes THIRD notebook i 've gotten from Sam 's Club really has me wondering about the quality of there products . First off i got a Qosmio , which i really didn have a problem with until i found someone elses documents on it and found out it wasnt suppose to be sold . So back it went , i had wanted another toshiba because it was super nice but they wouldnt send it from one club to another , so much for that . So i went back to Sam 's and picked up a Compaq which turned out to be crap , the screen flickered badly and the burner was only burning at 2X speed tops . So now to the Sony Vaio . Well after paying a hefty 1,149 bucks for it with smaller specs than some of the cheaper models i thought well great its a Sony what can go wrong ? Plenty . Here 's just a list of a pro and cons about the whole computer over all , and i do believe its a Sam 's thing . Not sony . Pros-Beautiful Screen . Con 's - Horrible Small sounding speakers , you could BARELY hear all the way up . -512 mgs of RAM as opposed to 1 gig in the cheaper HP 's Dell 's etc. . - Crashed when transfering some zip files off a Data disc , -LRB- note -RRB- this was right out of the box , i had to Restore Windows . - On most surfaces the DVD-RW-R tray would lock up and not open , then if lifted it would - DVD Movies would pause continuosly , and , or lock up - Crappy ole Windows Media Accelerator 950 as opposed to ATI or Nvidia . For that price u could at least put an ATI 200m in it . - Very Very slow 4200rpm hard drive as opposed to 5400rpms as you can get at other stores . - Just an over all sense that this is definately Wal-Mart made material , check the labels on some products you 'll see this to be true . So do n't stay away from Sony per-say just from Sam 's club Craputers . 	Laptop
The size , shape , durability and usefulness of this product is as described ... but it looks a bit different than I imagined . The surface is not as smooth as I thought it would be from the photo . Up close , the dots seem bigger and more colorful but the surface , overall , is more matte and dull . I probably would not have purchased this item if I had seen it in person first . I will probably resell it on eBay as the seller charges S&H both ways if the item is returned -LRB- ~ $ 11.00 -RRB- . 	Laptop
Ended up buying this product for my daughter 's 15 '' Dell computer . Had bought another sleeve for a 15 '' laptop , but computer did n't fit . Make sure if you are buying a sleeve , get the dimensions of your laptop and check the dimensions of the sleeve . Well built quality product . Ended up spending more for this sleeve than the previous one , but the quality was definitely noticeable . 	Laptop
I reviewed this product on several sites before I purchased . everyone of them recommended it . The cooler is very quiet . It dropped my laptop temperatures by 5 degrees . no problem or issues with the unit . 	Laptop
The specs are incomplete . This device _ does _ work from 100-240VAC , 50-60Hz . The USB ports are rated at 1.5 A though it is n't clear if that 's 1.5 A each or 1.5 A between the two USB outlets -LRB- Crutchfield says `` 5V DC , 1500 mA per USB port , '' but another reviewer stated that it 's 1.5 A total , and I tend to believe the reviewer -RRB- . 1.5 A is enough to charge one iPad , or two phones , and perhaps one iPad and one phone provided you 're not using the iPad during charging . Note that a USB 2.0 has a minimum guaranteed current of 500mA , but most laptops and desktops can provide significantly more current per port , and this device is no different . It 's nice to only have to carry a USB to MicroUSB cable -LRB- or USB to whatever cable -RRB- rather than another wall wart . I used this extensively in China , as well as in the U.S. . In China you need either a plug adapter or you need to cut off the ground pin because the usual `` universal '' outlets have no hole for the ground pin . Using a grounding adapter will work as well , but you 'll need to file down the wide -LRB- hot -RRB- blade to the same height as the narrow -LRB- neutral -RRB- blade because many `` universal sockets '' can not take the wide blade . If plugged into the bottom socket of a standard duplex outlet the upper socket is still usable for a non-grounded plug -LRB- if plugged into a GFI outlet where the sockets are further apart then the upper socket can be used even for a grounded plug -RRB- . One issue is that when used with a plug adapter , the whole thing tends to fall out the wall outlet when loaded with multiple devices so you need to prop it up somehow to keep it stable . You should also bring an extension cord when traveling . 	Laptop
Getting started with this speaker was as easy as opening the package and plugging the strip into my laptop . Done and done . Now I can actually hear downloaded movies - and in stereo ! LOVE IT -- wish I knew about this soonner . 	Laptop
Aluminum is a heatsink for the MacBook Pro and the Powerbook , so adding another layer of it in the form of a lap desk is the way to go . iLap comes with rubber feet to preserve your laptop feet . I had a lot of carpal tunnel issues in the wrist and arm so I need ergonomic solutions . Well I am pain free thanks to the iLap and a Logitech Marble Mouse . 	Laptop
The quality is great and it would have fit nicely into my work bag . However , I found the colors MUCH brighter in person than in the ad . I returned it because of this . 	Laptop
The speakers are awesome . When they arrived I opened the package and plugged them into my laptop and the sound just blew me away . I did not thing they would sound this good . I would recommend these speakers to anyone who are looking to upgrade there laptop stock speakers . 	Laptop
I 've been a pc user for more than 15 years ! All i have to say is once you go Mac you can never go Back . This computer is assume with a great battery life , it 's easy to learn and it 's fast . Go get your Macbook today . 	Laptop
I 'm returning my RAM to Amazon after writing this review . I use the 2011 Macbook pro OS X with bootcamp and Windows 7 . I am having constantly memory related errors , with kernel panics on Mac OS , and the `` Blue Screen of Death '' on windows 7 with references to `` memory management '' and error codes that are related to memory . I used memtester86 to confirm the diagnoses and replaced my new memory with my old memory -LRB- no more stability issues -RRB- . The biggest headache is the fact the fact this is the 3rd time that I have had to unscrew the bottom case of the Macbook pro to mess with the RAM . -LRB- The first time , my Macbook did n't recognize the RAM and would n't even boot , so I just reversed the order of the RAM and it booted up . '' To be fair it , I have been using the Macbook for a week , but have faced approximately 1-3 crashes a day , not depending on length of time , but on intensive usage -LRB- such as decoding a . h264 video -RRB- . I can do all these tasks with the old RAM -LRB- albeit just a little slower -RRB- without crashing , again confirming it is the RAM . I 'm sure this RAM must work for some users , but I assure you that it does n't work for the intel based macs , at least for me and many other users . The scariest part is about this , is that unless you are a little computer savvy , you may not recognize the specific memory issue as being the cause until it 's too late to return it . 	Laptop
This is a great case -- to protect from scratches ... do n't know if it will do much if dropped on the floor . But , it provides a little cushion . I love the pink floral one I ordered , though the smell is very strong . I set it outside for half a day , and the smell is still strong ... It wraps around my new Macbook Pro perfectly and has a double inside flap to protect from the zipper . For the price , I am happy ! 	Laptop
We were looking for Bluetooth technology for Motorola\/Sony computer . This is perfect . 	Laptop
A few years ago I tried different models and settled om the Logitech N120 for my laptop cooling needs . The Logitech does an excellent job but needs to be replaced every 4 to 6 months . I decided to pour through the reviews on Amazon and decided to buy the smallest Cooler Master since I have a 14 inch laptop and felt like trying something new . Pros : The USB adapter has its own socket so you do n't end up wasting a valuable USB port . The size of the stand is small and angled , making it easier to use the laptop when it is sitting on a flat surface in front of you . The fan can be moved to pinpoint particular hotspots on the laptop . Cons : There are many . The fan provides cooling to a specific area -LRB- 3-4 inch square -RRB- of the laptop and there is only one fan . If your laptop has more than one hot spot , too bad . You have to constantly readjust the placement of the fan or the laptop in a futile attempt to maintain a somewhat acceptable temperature before the laptop gives up and goes into standby . The angled stand is not adjustable and is awkward to use on one 's lap . My dying Logitech fan was more effective and eventually I went to my trusty backup - a frozen cooling block from the freezer . Conclusion : Buy a different cooling stand . While you are waiting for it to arrive go to your local drug\/grocery store and buy two large cooling blocks . They are fairly cheap and while you are using one , the other one can refreeze . They keep the laptop cool for a good 3-4 hours before you have to switch blocks . -LRB- Of course there is that pesky moisture issue and your lap might get cold . -RRB- I have ordered the newer Logitech N200 and will see if it is more effective . 	Laptop
I bought this because it was the cheapest computer available . It does n't print half the time , especially from Word Starter or the internet . The cd burner does n't work half the time . It is slower than my five year old HP . It takes Word minutes to open . It often takes minutes to open folders , especially the drive from My Computer , when you want to see if there is anything on the disk you tried to burn . It is basically a cheap piece of crap . Do not buy . 	Laptop
This is a really nice case for my Macpro . It protects well and have extra space for files and other accessories , including mouse , power adapter , pens , USB . It completely match my expectation . Love it . 	Laptop
It is so light . Well-made but relatively inexpensive bag for a laptop PC . It has lot of space . I love this product . 	Laptop
This is a really good product , the range of adaptors was great . Also the connection into the computer is sturdy and looks like it would take a lot of force break it . The delivery was very good and it is definitely worth what i payed for it . 	Laptop
I am amazed to see how fast and beautiful this laptop is . I had 3 netbooks and 2 11 inch laptops and none of them satisfied me so i sold them and the last one i just return it back to lenovo . Since i am almost 40 my eyes are starting to ask for glasses i thought the screen was going to be to small but i dont see the difference of my 2 other 13 inch laptops The keyboard light works great when typing in the dark my wife likes to watch netflix in the living room and turn the lights off i had to hook up my usb light and look for the keys of my other laptops now i am set . - the integrated video card can be changed with a press of a key and save battery with the shared video card built inn . - the size is great once you get used to the screen in a few days you will be more than happy . it weights a little more than a ultra portable 13 inch and definitely more than a netbook but the built and sturdiness of this laptop is better than anything out there in the market only Mac 's have this quality of built . I use it for Internet , -LRB- chrome -RRB- and office documents they open in a blink of an eye . . i tried some of my old games like doom 3 and battlefield and they play at full quality . - the battery will last you around 6 -7 hours without gaming and around 3 hours gaming . - I carry my alienware on my alienware backpack to work and back on my bike and you do n't notice the 5 or 6 pounds . . all over if you have the extra $ and you want to save a few $ $ since you are not buying the latest one with the newest processor this is a good choice .

I got this laptop about a month ago and so far so good . It 's worthy to note that I do n't use it for any heavy computing or gaming . I just wanted a laptop I could carry around or sit on the couch with and surf . I looked into the Samsung Series 9 also but , in the end , it was too expensive for what I needed it for . I also researched about some wifi problems it was having although I ca n't verify that myself . Pros : This laptop is very light , portable , good battery life , good mouse pad . Another thing is that it comes ready to use right out of the box . The only thing I really needed to install was Firefox which I appreciate . Some reviews I read previously to this were complaining that the speakers were bad but I do n't really notice . They seem to be fine to me when I stream vid . Cons : Despite all my praise , it 's not the `` perfect '' laptop . It does come with a ton of bloatware -LRB- unnecessary programs Toshiba put on there -RRB- . I have n't tried to take it out because I 'm not sure exactly what they all do but it does take up some space and is slightly annoying . I also wish the keyboard was backlit and the screen was matte because there is some glare but overall its not that bad . Overall , I would say if you need it for the same reasons I do , go for it . It was rated highly by C-net which is one of the reasons it caught my eye in the first place . It 's got a sandy bridge Intel Core i5 and 500 GB of space which along with its portability and battery life makes this laptop somewhat of a deal . If you need it for other reasons -LRB- like heavy computing or gaming -RRB- , you might want to do more research on it to see if its capable of handling it . 	Laptop
Restored life to my laptops - works for hours now . I 'm impressed . Obviously it sticks out the back so it makes the laptop slightly bigger , but I knew that when I bought it . Great buy ! 	Laptop
To everyone who ever feared removing the screws from the back of your laptop relax . This upgrade is about the easiest thing you can do to improve your laptop 's performance . The product arrived in one of those bubble wrap envelopes through regular postal service . I did n't pay for the extra fast delivery because I was n't in a big hurry . To install the memory all I had to do was disconnect my laptop -LRB- a dell 1555 -RRB- , remove the battery , remove three small screws from the back of my laptop and remove the old memory by gently pulling the springs that secured the memory in the socket and popping them out . Next I opened the envelope , found the memory in a small plastic case that easily opened with my fingers , oriented the first memory card to insert in the first slot and let it pop into place . I repeated the process with the second memory card , replaced the cover , inserted the screws , reinstalled the battery , plugged in the power supply and turned it on . The bios immediately recognized the new memory and adjusted itself accordingly . Honestly it took longer to write this than it did to replace the memory in my laptop . I used the old memory from my dell to upgrade an older HP pavillion from 1gb to 4gb . Now that 's what I call recycling . Oh yeah I pitched the two 512mb memory cards from the dell in the trash . If this was n't easy enough there are plenty of how to videos on Ehow and youtube to walk you through this simple yet valuable upgrade . Now for the good news . My system is running faster and handles web surfing and computations even faster . I am pleased with my decision to take my upgrade into my own hands and recommend that others use the maximum RAM their systems will allow . 	Laptop
I am not going to bore you with all the tech details the 15.2 '' Powerbook with Superdrive comes with , but I do want to let you know that I usually buy a new computer every year . They have all been PC 's , but I got sick and tired of crashes and that dreaded `` end program now '' prompting from Windows Xp . This would happen with any program that used alot of RAM such as photoshop etc. . Using two heavy duty programs or multi-tasking was impossible with Xp . Now with this beautiful Mac , no crashes , rock stable performance . I can run multiple screened programs effortlessly on the fly . The panther OSX system is rock stable . The computer is beautiful looking , it comes with some of the best software I have ever seen in a laptop . Steve Jobs has made me a believer ! I will never go back to owning just a PC . And the beauty of it all is that you can now share files with almost any Windows file format doing away with old compatibility problems . This computer is fast and does not stick . It is light , and looks very sleek . Nothing can beat that ! 	Laptop
I got so tired of having to put on a headset to get decent sound while watching tv or movies on my laptop , so decided to look for external speakers made for laptops . This gives pretty good sound , is easy to use and takes up very little space in my laptop case . I 'm so glad I bought this ! June 23 , 2011 : Edited to say that after less than a year , the speaker no longer works . 	Laptop
Extremely reasonable price-lowest I could find online . Works flawlessly in my Thinkpad x60 tablet . Windows Vista -LRB- business edition -RRB- recognized all 4 GBs of memory in my machine . Now it 's better than new . Great way to upgrade a starting-to-age notebook . 	Laptop
Pros : Detachable fan Extremely portable Cons : Rack is too small Only one small fan Rubber feet on bottom like to detach when sliding the rack around Can not use on LAP ! Summary : This thing is super small . It is advertised for 15 '' computers but I would not recommend this to people with laptops any bigger than 13 '' . My 15 '' MacBook Pro fits nicely on it , but the fan can not even go high enough and left enough to really start covering the hottest parts of the laptop . If you have a computer that is 13 '' or less , this is the laptop cooling rack for you . 	Laptop
The thing about this pad that I appreciate the most is it 's simple design . It is , in effect , a simple piece of aluminum bent into a cooler-pad shape , three fans bolted on , and a bunch of rubber grommets and pads to keep your computer and itself in place . The fans are standard 60mm size , nice and quiet , and when the day comes that one of them does start to fail , the wiring scheme is so simple that I 'll have a harder time scrounging the tools and parts to replace it than actually replacing the fan . The only real problem I have is it 's size . I have a large laptop -LRB- 17 '' HP DV7 -RRB- and it hangs a couple inches off either side and a little off the front , so it 's really designed for a machine smaller than the one I have . Despite this , it cools my machine exceptionally well and is stable enough that it has survived the `` curious toddler what 's - this-daddy ? test . '' Pros : All in all a well designed , sturdy , and efficient design . Fans easily serviceable\/replaceable . Cons : Completely open design on the sides and bottom . Little protection for underside wiring , not very portable . Overall size would work better for notebooks smaller than 17 '' . 	Laptop
Getting this battery to work on my Vaio SZ was a pain . Because it 's a third-party battery , you have to flash your Vaio 's BIOS to get it to work , however the software provided for this only works on 32-bit Windows , and I had 64-bit Windows . What I had to do to was create a new disk partition and install Windows XP to it , then flash the BIOS , then restore the WIndows 7 boot loader . The end result is that I have a battery that works well and was a lot cheaper than the official Sony one , but whether the price difference was worth the hassle is questionable . If you already have 32-bit Windows , installation will be a lot more straightforward . 	Laptop
Its really nice bag , sturdy and would be really useful for avid photographer . Unfortunately i am not one . I was looking for backpack that can double as camera bag . Because the bags are so well compartmentalized i found it hardly useful when i want to use it without the DSLR . 	Laptop
Hello there . I recently bought this hoping to put a Minecraft\/SSH server on my Ubuntu 10.04 desktop , but i ca n't figure out how to install the driver . please help , Quinn 	Laptop
I had to replace a five year old power adapter for my laptop that one day decided to make an incessant hissing sound . Replaced it with this one and it 's silent and great . 	Laptop
Worth the money so far and the usb 's are a plus next to the power button and the fan setting knob . I am getting very much use of this product . 	Laptop
I 've been using the adapter for 2 weeks now . It 's working as it should be . I was a little disappointed with the size . It 's bigger and a tad heavier than my previous adapter from Dell . But it works just as well . 	Laptop
This is a followup on my original 3 star review . They are getting a 5 STAR from me because of their great customer service . I had a problem with one of the lamps and wrote back to them . Immediately got a fast response . They are replacing no charge a new lamp . Thanks . . I 'm recommending others to buy from them . 	Laptop
Perfect for giving extended life to a 6-year old HP laptop , this memory upgrade was compatible and easy to install with the right price , upgrading from 512MB to 1.5 GB , plenty enough for fancy 3D GUI compiz using 64-bit Fedora Linux . 	Laptop
Before I get into my review , I should mention that I 've only owned this for a couple weeks , so I ca n't speak to its longevity . Also , unlike many , I bought this to be used with my standard desktop computer . -LRB- Windows 7 -RRB- I thought cutting down on wire-tangle alone would make it a logical purchase . Yes , it 's convenient to have to only deal with one wire , instead of the 3 that my old 2-speaker setup used . But that 's pretty much the only upside to this speaker . Here are my criticisms . -- When you plug the unit in and go to Windows Control Panel , you 'll see that your computer has sensed that different speakers are now being used , and a whole new set of sound options are made available for your new speaker . Unfortunately , this means that whatever options you had become accustomed to with your old speakers -LRB- like environmental effects -RRB- are no longer available to you . Also , the only available option in terms of equalizer settings comes in the form of adjustable bass levels . There is no treble setting . And since there is no separate treble setting on the unit itself , the sound never feels very crisp . In short , the sound quality is n't that stellar , which becomes all the more annoying when you consider the `` practicality issues '' below . -- There are a lot of inconveniences\/peculiarities with the operation of the speakers . For one , the volume buttons only seem to work when your Windows account is open . If a screensaver is playing or you are on the startup screen -LRB- with sound still playing from an open application -RRB- then the buttons do n't seem to do anything . -- The little hole in the speaker is , apparently , only for plugging in external devices like an mp3 player . It 's not a headphone jack . No problem , you say ? Why do n't you just plug your earphones directly into the headphone jack on the computer ? Well , that does n't work either . When the speakers are plugged in , that jack seems to become inoperable . So one has to go through the extra step of first unplugging the Logitech 's USB cord before any audio jacks on the computer become functional . -LRB- That also includes the audio jack in the back that my old 2-speaker set was plugged into . -RRB- It might sound nitpicky to make an issue of this ; but remember , the only real reason for buying this Logitech speaker -LRB- at least for me -RRB- was increased convenience . -- The volume gradations are n't very subtle . By this I mean , the quietest setting on the speakers is still surprisingly loud . Why do n't I just adjust the control panel 's main volume to a lower setting ? The problem with this is , when the speakers are in use , their volume level BECOMES your computer 's main volume setting . -- I really did n't appreciate how short the built-in USB cord was until I saw it in person . This might be an unfair criticism since these speakers are intended for laptops . I just mention this if people , like me , were hoping there there would be some flexibility in their usage . If you want to be able to place the speakers further away from the USB port than the few inches the built-in cord allows , you 'll have to buy a male-female USB extension cord . It 's true that this speaker is not exactly `` expensive , '' but it also is n't bargain basement either . I know people are delighted with the upgrade in sound compared to their laptop speakers , but laptop speakers are generally awful , so that 's kind of setting the bar ridiculously low in my opinion . I was personally hoping for more . Edit : Well , either that little hole is a non-functioning headphone jack , or a non-functioning jack to plug in an external music source . Either one earns this one less star than my original 3-star rating . 	Laptop
About the only thing good I can say about this fan is that is looks cool and that 's were the cool ends . The main issue with this fan is that it sucks the airflow down . This presents a major cooling problem since the majority of laptop are designed to pull the cool air up from the bottom then vent the hot air out the sides or the back . What happens when you put two opposing fans together ? Not much , less airflow means less cooling ! To increase cooling inside a laptop you need a fan that directs the airflow upward . This would increase the amount of air flowing through the computer and thereby keep the internal heat generating components cooler . That 's it , why is this so hard for the manufacturers of these so-called cooling fans to get ? It 's not rocket science ! I guess it 's about time I got in the notebook fan making business . 	Laptop
This is a must have for the price ! Does everything as advertised and I 've only had a couple issues with it . First , I have a myCharge portable battery for my Iphone . It came with a usb-micro usb cable to charge the myCharge and when I plugged the usb end into the usb in the Monster Outlet it would n't charge for some reason . I could have looked up what the blinking lights meant in the manual but chose not to cuz I plugged the usb from the myCharge into the ac\/usb that came with my iphone and plugged that into the ac outlets in the Monster and it worked fine . So I dunno what the problem was . And once I tried to plug the usb from my Iphone into the Monster usb my Iphone charged fine . The other problem I had was I have all the outlets filled up but one and one usb outlet filled up and I tried to put another item in the ac outlet and it sparked briefly but work fine . Another time I tried removing the cable from my computer out of the Monster and accidently touched the metal prongs from my computer cable while removing and I was shocked . Nothing major or anything like that but just seemed kinda odd . I like it tho ! Also if you plug the Monster into the bottom half of the two outlets on your wall , you are still able to use the top one . Def a plus ! 	Laptop
I bought two of these USB 2.0 External CD-ROMs for two Acer Aspire ONE 722-0879 netbooks equipped with Windows 7 Home Premium OS -LRB- one for home the other for the office -RRB- , because the External CD-ROMs for my original ACER netbooks equipped with Windows XP did not work with Windows 7 . The price was right and I was not thwarted by the six negative reviews on Amazon , because -- as explained below -- they were obviously due to misunderstanding . Two reviewers wrote this CD-ROM does not burn CDs and can not burn or record information or music . Another said that a CD-ROM on a computer plays DVDs , and how come this one does not . The truth is that a CD-ROM simply reads CDs . It does not burn them ; to do that you need a CD Writer . As for burning DVDs , of course you need a DVD Writer . Another reviewer wrote that this CD-ROM is not compatible with Windows 7 . Not true again . I took the CD-ROMs out of the boxes and using only one USB cable both for power and data , -LRB- a great convenience versus some external CD-ROMs that need two connection cables , one for data , one for power -RRB- I immediately loaded the Microsoft Plus software successfully on both of my two ACER netbooks which are equipped with Windows 7 Home Premium OS .

I have an old laptop that used to run very hot , shutting itself down regularly . The two fan version of the U2 Notebook Cooler completely solved the problem , at a low enough price that it seems completely worth the investment . The cooler seems sturdy enough that I would expect it to last , and I like that the fan place ment was completely adjustable , so I could point both fans ot the part of my laptop that got hottest . I would absolutely recommend this item ! 	Laptop
Note : I purchased the 19-inch version since my laptop has a widescreen ratio -LRB- 16:9 -RRB- and extended number pad on my keyboard . They offer smaller versions with two fans as well . I do n't have a state-of-the-art gaming laptop by any means , but my processors do heat up -LRB- sometimes reaching up to 90-95 C -RRB- . I 've tried to look for many cooling solutions for this heat including the Zalman product line -LRB- Specifically , the NC3000 with the aluminum base and large 6-7 bladed fan and it did next nothing in terms of pushing air underneath my computer - yes it was quiet , but no it did not cool my laptop -RRB- . The Cooler Master is made from brushed aluminum -LRB- painted in black -RRB- which dissipates heat very well and has rubber contact points for your laptop which are n't simply glued on but are shaped around the metal . Note that the cooler props up your laptop at an angle -LRB- good for airflow and ergonomics -RRB- But what makes this stand out is the fact that the 3 fans have a sort of clip-on feature so you can arrange the 3 fans to optimize the cooling effect . The fans are all connected through a central control device which can clip onto the side of the aluminum base and allows the user to control the speed like one does with a light dimmer . Numbers : I use CPUID Hardware Monitior to check my GPU , four processors , HDD and RAM temps . With the fans running on high -LRB- for gaming -RRB- , I can see between 7 - 10 C of cooling . The fans push air up and out underneath your laptop -LRB- unlike some coolers which suck the air from the heat sink on the bottom of some laptops -RRB- . Recommendation : Buy this cooler . 	Laptop
This 2gb ram has made my boot faster on my netbook . I think that surfing the web has become a little faster too . It was easy to insert in the memory slot . I recommend this to anyone with a netbook or notebook with too little memory . 	Laptop
After exactly a year and 30 days later , the battery failed to work ... and now I am back online purchasing a battery ... do n't buy a compaq ... 	Laptop
I think the case is excellent in looks , it 's exactly what I wanted . I have n't used it very much because the Zipper broke the week I got it . 	Laptop
I have been very pleased with cooler . It is not a rugged industrial piece of equipment I use my laptop in very nasty environments ; hard drive area was getting uncomfortable to touch . This cooling pad has really help . Now that project is over my kid 's think I am at lease somewhat cooler with bright blue LED 's . 	Laptop
THe price is right . I need it for infrequent use attached to a docking station for a Tablet PC . I tested all units and one door would not open without assistance and would not play a DVD when assisted . Sent back easily for full credit . 	Laptop
Works as advertised . I personally made the mistake and bought this module where as the old module I removed from my net book was faster . It 's a slight decrease in speeds . However its a net book I installed it in ... Speed is n't a net book 's forte . So that being said . it 's perfect for what I needed it for . 	Laptop
One thing you have to remember is this little computer runs on a full blown operating system giving you full functionality for internet and file sharing and management . If you want a toy then get one of those iOS or Android tablets . If you want a computer & tablet then this is for you . If you dump all the useless software that Dell puts on and use Windows as you would on any computer it performs quite well . It has a very nice clear screen . Streams movies well . The only drawback is Windows 7 limitations for a tablet only computer . I 'm hoping when Windows 8 comes out it will lift those limitations . 	Laptop
people think the length is ridiculous , but I just laugh at them when they ca n't reach and all of em have to sit close to the walls at school . lol 	Laptop
This case is good for carrying your laptop in another bag . It has metal rings you could attach a strap to in order to carry it alone , but it does n't come with a strap . The design is pretty and the padding is thicker than other cases at the same price . 	Laptop
My experience was not good . Fortunately I had a tech install the Ram . There were problems right off the gitgo . The Tech made some adjustments and the laptop seemed to work however he suspected a compatibility problem and explained what to do . I took the laptop home and started to use it . It would either lock up or crash . After numerous efforts I replaced the old RAM . I contacted the company who provided the option of a return for full refund or alternately a replacement . I chose the refund as I had already wasted a good part of a day as well as paying for a tech initially . The Tech explained that compatibility can be a problem . That does not mean that the RAM was deficient but that it was not compatible with my machine . I can not say the product is good or bad . It did not work for me . 	Laptop
She loves it . While it did have the smell many reviewers have commented on it aired out within a day or two and is just fine . It has room to carry a power cord or extra battery pack since we got 17 '' one and as I said , she loves it ! 	Laptop
At the beginning I had problems viewing and listening to the image , called my teen son ! and done -LRB- he found how to set the picture and sound in Youtube -RRB- for may macbook pro . working great ! 	Laptop
This machine has been VERY disappointing . When it runs , it 's fine . It just does n't run very often . Machine has been to HP for repair 3 times in the first 10 months I have owned it . Overheats and turns itself off , screen will go black if it is moved , mouse constantly freezes and locks and machine has to be rebooted . I 've raised enough stink with HP they are replacing it with a higher end model a ZV . If you buy this machine due to it 's attractive price , buy an extended warranty and be prepared to be without it often . 	Laptop
These privacy filters are great if you have someone sitting next to you at a conference or at a meeting , however they do not reduce or distort or hide the view from anyone sitting at the table behind you in a conference or coffee shop . i thought with the `` Gold '' privacy filter it would be a little better . overall i am satisfied . it does most of what i expected .

I just needed a basic type MP3 player for the gym and exercise bike , and this is very light with strong music functions . Ear buds are comfortable , and the standard jack lets you use different buds or external speakers . Very nice player ! 	MP3 Player
I bought this little beauty almost a year ago , and it is nearly a perfect player . I could only gripe that it does n't support Monkey 's audio - but that 's not fair since 99 % of mp3 players do n't - or AAC -LRB- itunes -RRB- files , but since I do n't really give a crap about itunes format , I ca n't really gripe about that either . It 's just that most people already have a library in that format unfortunately , so it would make sense to support it , but personally I prefer lossless , non-proprietary formats . Format preferences aside , everything you could want from an mp3 player is here . One thing that should be noted is that the actual audio chip in this thing produces very high quality audio compared to some other mp3 players . I could go on about all the features , but they 're all in the product description , so let me instead comment on the battery and other minimal complaints I 've read about here . Mine has had zero issues , and I 've owned two of these , and only because I sent the first one to a watery grave in the laundry . I owned it for months with no issues , and now my second one is proving to be just as good . I think the issues some have had have been resolved . Bottom line : this player is possibly the best value in media players period , and you can take it to the gym without worrying about a $ 270 misstep with a dumbbell . I 'm not sure if it 's destructible -LRB- outside of being submerged in water or taking a hammer to it -RRB- , but if it is , you can replace it for less than what Apple would charge you to replace an iPod 's battery . + you would n't have to re-sync your whole library , just pop the sd card out and put it in the new one !

I have many different flash\/usb drives that I use for music , etc. . This chunk of junk only supports the Lexar flashdrives . Forget it . I got mine from Fry 's for $ 40 and back it goes tomorrow . 	MP3 Player
I am currently deployed , and these speakers have turned out to be heaven sent . They are small , so carrying them around is no problem . The volume is so nice , that while at work , I can turn up the sound and our whole tent can listen to music . Being so mobile , they come in handy because they will plug into anything . I think once my friends saw my speakers , they all want to buy one now so they can use them while they work . I recommend these speakers to anyone on the go . They are very light weight , small enough to fit in the front pocket of your backpack , and the sound quality is great for both the size and price . It also comes with a cute little bag that protects it , which works great with all this sand . 	MP3 Player
I was hesitant a first with all the bad feedback but , I guess I lucked out . I purchase mine on ebay and have owned them for a month now . I loved them . Best $ 15 I spent in a long time ! The charge holds for an hour and twenty five minutes with a full charge . Holds 60-75 songs on average . Only con is it takes 5-6 hours for a full charge via usb . All in all I ca n't ask for more for $ 15 . - No wires makes me feel free ! 	MP3 Player
Love this player easy to use and carry , use it almost every day to listen to pod casts and music no complaints in 3 months 	MP3 Player
This device has several very serious flaws . The biggest one is that you ca n't make playlists . The way that it arranges tracks is only by artist , album , genre or `` all songs '' , in which case it arranges all tracks alphabetically . Even if you select `` artist '' you can still only listen to tracks from a single album by that artist . So if you load 2 songs from a certain album , it will play those 2 songs and then stop and then you have to mess around with the menu controls again . 	MP3 Player
I have delayed for years in getting a portable MP3 player . I briefly had one when they first came out , but the sound quality and capacity were woefully inadequate . Keeping in mind that I own an iPad , this tiny little player is my new favorite gadget : -LRB- 1 -RRB- it 's about the size of the key-clicker for my car . -LRB- 2 -RRB- expandable memory + 8GB microSD card = plenty of music , plenty of variety , and minimal impact on start-up time . -LRB- 3 -RRB- unbelievably efficient interface and design . -LRB- 4 -RRB- intuitive to use , though not fully integrated with MediaMonkey -LRB- the BEST mp3 library software on the planet -RRB- . -LRB- 5 -RRB- really clean , accurate sound , so much so that I now have a list of CD 's that I need to re-rip . -LRB- 6 -RRB- it does voice recording , too ? are you freaking kidding me !? Downsides -LRB- which I consider really inconsequential for the price -RRB- : -LRB- 1 -RRB- i like to let my electronics drain completely before recharging , and I have n't figured out yet how to connect to the PC without the battery automatically recharging . -LRB- 2 -RRB- do n't bother with the included earbuds , get some noise-isolating earbuds instead ; very comfortable ; -LRB- 3 -RRB- biggest drawback is that this unit will only last as long as its battery . there seems to be no way to replace it , nor is there the availability of a secondary source of power .

All Cowon Players are awesome music and video players I learned that all Cowon products are not Apple\/Mac compatible . I strongly recommend that anyone considering purchasing one `` Do not plug your new Cowown into a Mac . '' It will erase the flash drive , actually the Mac will turn the Flash Drive invisible and one has to re-format the flash drive only using a PC . As long as one uses a Personal Computer with any version of Windows you will be fine . I did not get the opportunity to really try out Cowon X7 before I wiped the Flash drive . I purchased a Cowon J3 and think the AMOLED is way better than the LCD screen . I did a lot of research on both LCD vs AMOLED and the Amoled is just a smarter more efficient technology and you can see the difference . Once a Cowon device is plugged into a PC you can drag and drop music files . Video files I had to convert using the recommended software that came with the player . If one actually wants to watch a full movie on almost any of these Cowon products one has to purchase the full version of Jet Audio for $ 29.00 or buy from a independent company that sells similar software from the web . I bought the full version of Jet Audio and have not been able to load it properly onto a PC . I have not had the opportunity to talk to tech support . I got a load error issue when I installed the full version . I also bought other software from the independent companies and while most company have pre set video codecs for almost any American Mp3 Player and other devices even Archos none have a pre set codec for Cowon Players go figure . I will be happy to share that I bought a pair of JVC headphones and a pair of Bose headphones and I could not tell a sound difference because Cowon makes such good products . I returned the Bose headphones and save $ 200 dollars . One more thing it 's worth the extra money to get the 32GB flash drive versus 16GB even though it has a micro SD slot . Make note that once I got a case for my J3 it did not feel cheap and flimsy like other suggested . I still would not recommend trying to drop any of these players but at least with a case you have some protection versus none . If you got the money go for the warranty I think it would pay for itself . I like the fact that all but the Cowon D3 are not Internet capable which is a good thing meaning nobody can send you a virus . I hope this review helps out a lot of new buyers . 	MP3 Player
Purchased this player last week from Amazon and love it . Initial load time is only 5 to 10 seconds for a full CD , and load time between tracks is about one second on random shuffle ! Love the random feature , can randomize full CD or within a folder , looks great and never skips . I use it in my car , the car adapter is not included and about $ 45 so they get you in the greens for that . But overall I really like the product and feel it 's the best choice out there today for a portable mp3 player . 	MP3 Player
This player is a terrific performer , especially given it 's budget price . All functions have worked as advertised . The only problem I have had is the instructions that came with it are woefully inadequate , and it is not really an intuitive product . I have had to reference the internet several times for `` tech tips '' , such as how to lock the touch screen . Now that I have the hang of it , I am very happy with my purchase ! 	MP3 Player
One of the most useful items Creative has ever produced . I have two - get one and you 'll be happy with it . Get some rechargeable AAA batts and you 'll be even happier ! 	MP3 Player
The product is good - like other reviewers have suggested , and it takes most formats you throw at it , and will play them for you without any hassle . The only problem is , the build feels very cheap , and the buttons look like they will stop working in a day or two . Well , that 's exactly what happened with our piece . One of the buttons stopped working , and its just a useless piece of device for us now -- even though we loved it while it was working . I missed the return date BY A DAY ! Will return it anyway as it is of no use for me in this state . I would go for something higher-end -- something that 's built to last , not something that lasts just the warranty period .

In my view , the best thing about this line of players is Sandisk has continued to support Linux . Users like myself do not want anything fancy . In fact we specifically DO N'T want anything fancy . I tossed out the Rhapsody and `` Tune-Up '' info that came with my player . It does n't work in Linux ... and I do n't want it anyway . There are three reasons I wrote this review : 1 -RRB- To reassure potential Linux buyers that you can still mount this in MSC mode -LRB- NOT the default . . you need to change it -RRB- and see the device mount as an ordinary file system . I transfer my music using midnight commander -LRB- a text-based file manager -RRB- but the point is , you just treat it like it was a USB stick . 2 -RRB- Although there is explicitly a MUSIC folder in this file system , I do n't use it . I keep my tunes in folders by artist and sub-folders by album , and the Clip Zip supports this . 3 -RRB- When I first got it , I loaded up most of its 8 GB with my collection , and it hung on `` Refreshing Media '' when I disconnected it from the PC . I found this disturbing . Others have talked a lot about this failure mode . I wish it would fail with `` bad file '' or something more useful than just hanging . The point is , if it takes more than a couple minutes to refresh , something is wrong . In my case , I deleted ALL FILE , then removed . m4a files from my collection and ONLY loaded . ogg and . mp3 ... Now it works fine with 4 GBytes of mixed tunes on it . This failure mode cost it a star ... The problem occurs across entire Sansa line . 	MP3 Player
It has got all the features that I want for a MP3 player -LRB- including radio , recording , large storage space and battery replacement possibility ... -RRB- . The sound quality is good ! . I could only wish that it were a bit thinner . 	MP3 Player
Received this as an Xmas gift this year and the main problem I 'm having with it is compatibility with my XP operating system . It does n't seem to remember installing the device and repeately asks me to `` install new hardware . '' <p> After installing it , I 'm able to download a set of music - but if I complete that first download and then try to do another one , the PC no longer `` sees '' the device . I 'm not done trouble shooting the problem , so if anyone else experiencing similar PC woes has any advice , it 's greatly appreciated ! <p> Its size is great , functionality very simple & straightforward and could n't be much more lightweight . The headphones are a bit clunky and definitely wo n't work if you 're wearing anything with a collar - like a vest or windbreaker - when moving your head , the collar bumps into the back of the headphones & knocks them out of your ears . But replacing the headphones is a cinch , so that 's minor . <p> If it was less bulbous and came with a belt clip , that would be ideal . It 's often handier to be able to clip it to your belt or waistband if your hiking with a pack , for example - keeps it out of the way of straps , etc. <p> It 's a good unit and if Philips can make a few improvements both to software\/PC support and practical refinements , they 'll have a winner .

This was a Christmas present for a 10 year old who wanted a little stereo in her room , and an MP3 player . I was hoping to get two in one with this item , but I am disappointed in the MP3 player . It does work , and sounds OK , but the menu and instructions for it are baffling . This morning I recorded one of her songs onto it from the RCA stereo -LRB- after 2 tries -RRB- , but it does n't shut off the recording when you hit the stop button , and now there is a few seconds of the next song on the MP3 player , and you would think I could easily delete it . No , I ca n't . The instruction booklet has never been put away because you always have to refer to it to work this system . It is not intuitive at all . The book does tell you how to delete files , but does n't explain how to get to the file to delete . It is very irritating to me , and I am currently looking for a regular MP3 player to replace it . Plus the RCA MP3 player that comes with it is 128MB and is n't too overwhelming in style and features . I have been able to record 6 songs to it , but the first second or two of the songs get cut off because there is no way -LRB- that I have found -RRB- to start the song and recording simultaneously . Pausing the song and hitting record do n't work . Often it takes 3 or 4 pushes to get the record button to register I want it to record and the song has already started . AS for the stereo , it is fine , plays the CD 's well and I ca n't complain about that . It looks like a neat system with its own style , but just do n't buy it to get the MP3 with it . It was n't worth the headache for me . 	MP3 Player
Sweet little player once you can get by with the lousy instructions -LRB- can get them on-line -RRB- . If you use windows media player to sync ... good luck because it automatically dumps everything in your library onto the clip . I found it very easy to just drag and drop the files and avoid the media player altogether . Never could get the Rhapsody software to work properly that came with it . That is proabaly a good thing because the last Sandisk player I purchased came with all these nice free downloads which were great but what they did not tell you was after 90 days you had to pay a montly fee if you wanted to keep them . They probably did but it sure was not obvious . 	MP3 Player
I bought this unit more than 4 years ago and , after so much use and abuse , the unit works like no other . Also , it 's one of the few , if not the only mp3 player that lets you record from the radio and then play it back . 	MP3 Player
It is a good mp3 player for the money . It has good sound quality , holds plenty of tunes for a workout and does n't skip a all . I found that once you get it playing push the hold switch on and it will play on and on without anything to stop it . The battery life last me about a week of use with the one AA . The FM Radio is good enough for use in the gym but it 's does n't have great reception for picking up stations like my car radio does . The only real complaint is the arm band and case in the package are useless . You will need to get the armband and belt clip accessory . On another note when I first got it took me about 2 hours to figure out how to use all the functions , since then it has been easy to use . 	MP3 Player
I just bought it from Target since I could n't wait to own one and get into the 21st century . I got mine for 79 $ 64 Meg . I am thinking of going back and getting the 128 Meg . I love it so far . Easy to operate . Great Armband . Loud . Easy to operate and an awesome first MP3 player . RCA rules . 	MP3 Player
I have had quite a few different mp3 players including the Creative Jukebox 3 and Zen models and as a total package , the ipod is simply the best . The click wheel works extremely well and the sound , although not as good as some of the Creative players , is more than adequate . One downside of the ipod is the extreme sensitivity of the backside of the player to fingerprints and scratches . It looks great but is really hard to maintain . Get a case the day you buy your ipod . Marware sells the best cases - I purchased the sports suit convertible and it is excellent . It protects the ipod while allowing access to the click wheel and other controls . The only downside is that the ipod really should be removed from the case during charging to dissapate any heat generated . The neoprene of the case , while great for protection is awful for dissapating heat . It 's still a wonderful case . I switched to the Ipod from the Creative line of mp3 players because of Creative 's dreadful and basically nonexistant customer support and short product lifetime . My experience with Apple 's customer support has been outstanding thus far . A toll free number is provided on the website -LRB- you have to search a little to find it , but it is there -RRB- and a representative was on the line within 3 minutes . The rep was very professional and readily answered my questions about using the Ipod . I 'm purchasing the applecare support to extend coverage of my Ipod to two years . It will be well worth it to receive this level of support and to have peace of mind . Outstanding - I 've been impressed . I basically love everything about the Ipod , but there are a few things that could be improved upon . Of course , the battery is the biggest issue . I am routinely getting 10-12 hours of play time per charge , but I really do n't think this is adequate when the competition 's players are going 24 hours on a charge and their batteries are user replaceable . The provided software , Itunes , could be improved upon but generally does a more than adequate job . Some of the features are terrific like the tagging abilities . The biggest negative is that ITunes does n't allow exportation of mp3 files from the Ipod to the computer and that is a real pain . For now , you have to use a third party software like Sharepod -LRB- freeware -RRB- or Anapod -LRB- a bargain at $ 25 -RRB- to do this . One big negative I 've seen users comment on is n't really true - I 've seen users state that the automatic syncing of the Ipod with the library results in the loss of any files on the Ipod that are n't in the library at the time of syncing . This is true , but only sort of . If you choose automatic syncing , then you can loose files like these users have described , but all you 've got to do is choose manual syncing to get around this . Itunes gives you the option - a lot of folks seem to be unaware of this . In conclusion , Even though ITunes could be improved upon , the software does just about everything that is necessary and it absolutely shines in comparison to the software that Creative ships its mp3 players with . With the Creative players , I HAD to purchase a third party software -LRB- Notmad explorer is a great choice -RRB- for basic day to day tasks . The operation of the Ipod itself is fairly straightfoward and downright beautiful . The Ipod is an extraordinarily sleek little player . Apple does not go into much detail in the manual on how to use the click wheel and for some this could be a problem . It took me a week to figure out that the way to scroll through a long menu was with a circular motion on the clickwheel . Once you get the knack of how to use the click wheel , it is hard to imagine that there could be anything designed that could be more efficient or closer to genius . In conclusion , buy a case at the same time you purchase your ipod and be sure to back up your mp3 files on CDs or a hard drive . As far as the decision to purchase the Ipod , well , that 's a no brainer in my mind . I could n't be any happier with my purchase and I 'm very happy that I 've left the Creative line behind .

This is a truly amazing piece of machinery . I am 14 years old and if anyone here uses an MP3 player the way I use it , that means you just carry it around in your pocket and listen to it whenever you have the chance . The AllRandom feature is great , and the mp3 player already comes with 59 songs on it . I do n't even want to get started on the battery life because I think almost everybody knows this outdoes any other mp3 player . Second , the sound quality is good enough for me , I 'm not picky and I do n't really know how to compare it to anything else but to me it sounds amazing and I could n't ask for better . This is just as good as an iPod if not better . But , the thing that makes this so much better than an iPod is the price . I bought it for $ 220 , thats 80 dollars cheaper than an iPod . Also , its at least $ 100 dollars cheaper than the i-River and the other big guys . Even though it 's bigger than an iPod , it 's still really small ... It easily fits in my pocket and is easy to acess . Overall , this is a great mp3 player and I think that all the bad reviews are just by perfectionists that want every single thing possible to be perfect . But we all know that nothing is perfect .

I ordered this for my daughter , as she wanted a small MP3 device . It actually comes with a 2GB micro SD memory . Some minor problems : the tiny nails on the side are somewhat loose , so plugging in the USB cable always pushes the inner parts through the shell . Also the device seems to be on USB 1.0 -LRB- my guess -RRB- since copying files to it is 15 times slower than USB 2 . 	MP3 Player
I just got this product yesterday , and I am already using it . It 's extremely easy to use . Before this I have had regular CD players , mp3-CD players , and small 64mb flash mp3 players , but this beats them all . It 's very small , and everyone saying it 's large must not know a thing about mp3 players because if you want your storage space measured in GB and not MB , it 's gonna be kinda large and heavy . Every HD mp3 player I 've seen uses laptop drives . The headphones are awful , awful bass , and they do n't fit very well , but that 's to be expected , because no company gives you decent headphones with their product , so you have to buy new ones : -RRB- ! I have n't seen how long the batteries last , but I 'm sure they 're fine . If given the choice , I would get this product again . 	MP3 Player
So , maybe I 'm a slow learner , but I wanted to give the thing a fair chance . Four attempts in three different vehicles , and blew the fuse every time , the instant it was plugged in . If you buy this , get a case of car fuses to go along with it . 	MP3 Player
I bought this product because I loved my old Sansa Clip but wanted more storage . It was small , the button configurations and user interface were very similar , and my previous Sansa Clip was very durable so I made the purchase . Pros : Small and light Easy to use Mini-SD card slot The clip is handy for gym & work Cons : Protruding power button allows player to turn on in purse and run the battery down \*\*\* Periodically dies anywhere from 2 hours to 2 days -LRB- at decent battery % , no response to charger -RRB- \*\*\* Meh : Battery life is n't great but it 's not horrible either The random dying while the battery is charged is what ruins an otherwise decent little MP3 player for me . It will not respond to button pushing , chargers , and USB data connections , and it happens progressively more often the longer I 've owned it -LRB- although the amount of time it spends `` dead '' is completely random -RRB- . I 'm not going to bother sending it back under the warranty ; I 'll be buying something more reliable . Others seem to have much better experiences with their players , so I may just have one of a few defective units . TLDR : Not a bad MP3 player for what 's expected of it - but beware that some units may have serious problems . 	MP3 Player
I 've tried the nano , and let me tell you ... its not that great . for one ... the screen is always marked up . 2 : i do n't like useing itunes . 3 : most people have to replace there ipods after 1 year . When i saw the sandisk e250 , that was it . i did n't need to look any longer . its got a cooler looking display , organized your data better and does n't cost a million bucks that you 'll have to pay a year later to replace . all in all ... i 'd say its pretty G.

I had the same experience as the reviewer who said the DirectDeck only played out of one side of the speakers . I bought TWO and both had the same problem . Normal volume on the left side , whisper quiet on the right . 	MP3 Player
Unlike Coke Cola company , which continues to produce exceptional products , Sony has thrown in the towel when it comes to it WALKMAN market share , and loyal customers . While millions of hard working adults and millions of dillegent students have turned to Sony Walkman for their music while at the gym or out in the sports field , Sony has turned its back on them . This D-NF340 will be one of the last walkmans , as its quality has continuously diminished , and Sony has lost its willpower to make leading edge MUSIC . First , the FM Tuner does a poor job in getting a good reception . I mostly get static on my machine . So , what happened SONY ? Where is the quality ? Second , the CD Style is outdated , as so many are moving into SD cards , micro SD cards , and internal memory to play the music . Sony should have continued with their ATRAC-3 technology , and onto memory stick , rather than throw in the towel to just MP3 . Yet , something could be said about going MP3 , which makes sense . But , not providing a SPORTS walkman , now that is bad news . It is like Coke Cola saying to Pepsi , `` ok , you win . '' Now , wait a minute . Both Coke Cola and Pepsi continue to make advancements , and both continue to make sales and keep business going . So , what happened Sony . Is this the end for Sony ? The CD style is also very bulky . There is no need to carry such a bulky physical CD anymore . But , another version of the Walkman should have been created . Shame on you , Sony . Third , the knobs and controls are good , yet they could be better served on a digital walkman . There is something nice by having knobs and buttons , controls and sliding switches . The controls of such nature blend well with humans who are sweating , running , exercising , stretching , pulling , pushing , bumping , etc. . The digital up\/down arrows , push etc. just are not controling enough for this person . Maybe it is the same with driving a car . Manual transmission , putting the hand on the stick shift knob , feeling the car going from first to second , from second to third , and so on . That feel is part of being human . Not sure why a sports version of a digital mp3 player by the GREATEST CREATOR of WALKMAN can not put together such a product . Knobs , oh how they provide controlable pleasure . Fourth , the sports thing . This CD player , along with its many many prior versions failed the drop test . Oh , so many start loosing a function , like the loss of one side audio , or loss of display , etc. after one drop on the ground . And , because they are heavy , what can you expect . Ahh Punka , Bash , Blop , Clunk ! , Dah Pinga , Dah Dong , Blip , Ding , Dong , Crash , Kaput . Even the sports version was heavy . Eh . So , yeah SONY WALKMAN designers , make the MP3 version with digital memory , in the light weight version , please . Sweat resistant , slightly water resistant -LRB- for the rain , -RRB- unlike this one . Dah ? Where have you been Sony ? And , call it the Walkman , MAN !! Now , for all the poor people who just do not want to hurt their eyes , make the display FONT size a good bit larger . Give your loyal customers a break . Large enough so it can be seen in various environments - lighted room , darken street , etc. . Some of us JOG at night , and can use the larger font size . Until then , this product is a `` do n't buy . '' It is not a sports version , It is not supported by Sony software , it is not MP3 and ATRAC3 , it is not light weight , it is not water resistant , ... what it is ... OLD FASHION . 	MP3 Player
Oh if only I could rate this item with negative stars ! What a piece of trash ! The design of the player is nice and I love how I can drag and drop files through explorer , but just as I am starting to enjoy my player , it breaks . The first one did n't last a week . It just stopped turning on by day six . The second one did n't last a week either and it also stopped turning on . Sandisk obviously does n't care about quality control , since both players malfunctioned in under seven days . And yes , the batteries were charged and I did not in any way damage the player to cause the problems . I 'm returning my piece of trash and requesting a refund that I will probably spend on an i pod . I hate i pods , but I hate being jerked around even more . Here 's a word of advice to the potential customer . Save the packaging . I guarntee by day six your player will break too . 	MP3 Player
After light use of 2-3 hrs per week for ten months , player died , stopped responding . Bought a new Creative player -LRB- the Zen V -RRB- to replace it , same thing happened , this time after three days . No more Creative products for me I guess ... . 	MP3 Player
I could recount the misery of installing the Zune software on my PC , which would have stumped the majority of PC users , forcing them to either confront the horror of tech support or return the Zune HD . I could complain about the necessity of said Zune software for moving media to the player , which imposes terrific constraints . I could further complain about how the software takes a long time to start up as it thrashes the hard drives , how the recommendation engine is frustrating\/ineffective -LRB- at least to date -RRB- , and how lots of music is not available on ZunePass . But . Having lived with the Zune HD for a week , I never want to go back . The device itself is in no uncertain terms an extraordinary achievement , both hardware and software . As other reviews point out , volume control is the most noticable interface flaw , but it is -LRB- for me -RRB- far offset by the rest of the interface design and the flawless response of the touch control . There is the inevitable comparison between the Zune HD and the iPod Touch ; I can not say that much about this , except that having dealt with my wife 's iPhone and its quirks and interface , I am pretty confident that the Zune HD is a better choice for me . The generally-agreed poorer sound quality and the unpleasantness of iTunes reinforce this evaluation . The Zune software , once working , combined with ZunePass , are the other side of the equation . The Zune software 's features and interface , combined with the seamlessness and depth of ZunePass , have moved me a quantum leap ahead in seeing what I have and exploring what 's available . For the first hour I thought of the Zune software as a nasty hurdle in front of using the Zune HD ; now I would stick with the software even if I did n't have the device . This product is _ not _ for everybody . Given the software install nightmare , and various other software nightmares that you can experience -LRB- have a look at the Zune message board -RRB- , you need to be pretty interested and serious about tinkering with your PC before you approach . The necessity of the Zune software will restrict your freedom - no dragging and dropping of files here , good luck figuring out what 's going on under the covers . And if you just want to listen to music , there are cheaper ways to get there . But if it is for you , then it 's _ really _ for you . I 'd compare it to being a car enthusiast with a Maserati - it 's expensive , it has its quirks , and it might be in the shop a bit for expert repairs , but when you 're driving it that 's all forgotten .

I took the time to look back into the older reviews of this unit and I 'm a bit disappointed by the newer reviewer comments . I used to own the older Fuze and will not repurchase it for three reasons , probably unique to me . 1 . the power switch wore down so much I need a pen to operate it now , 2 . the wheel in the front froze up and stopped turning . I had to cut notches into the front of it for grip and 1 drop of oil to free the frozen mechanism -LRB- which was not affected by the oil -RRB- , and 3 . my work involves time near a lab table and the earphone jack constantly gets yanked out when it hooks onto something . The jack is so loose it does n't like staying plugged in any more . This is why certain features on the Fuze + are attractive to me . Sony has a Bluetooth MP3 player Sansa would be smart to emulate soon . I digress . I just do n't understand why people do n't research a product far enough to understand that corrections have been made concerning complaints about the unit , but they did n't take the time to find it out before trashing the unit . Many people have stated that those issues were corrected , and other fixes are on schedule for the next firmware update . Products can not be repackaged and updated at the stores when a firmware update is issued . That 's the responsibility of the purchaser to do since the company has made it available for them , free of charge . I use mine for audiobooks primarily and my old unit had some issues but nothing I could n't work around and this unit may have a few issues as well but it sure is a huge amount cheaper for what you get compared to the Apple products . 	MP3 Player
My first review was negative because the unit turned out to be defective . Since I got through the company 's warranty process and received my new one , I 'm very pleased with it . It 's reliable and easy to use . It works perfectly with Windows Media Player . I still think it could use clearer or better thought out documentation . But , for the price , what can you expect ? If you 're a neophyte like me , beware you ca n't use music downloaded from iTunes . Apple 's music service uses proprietary encoding which only iPods can read . 	MP3 Player
Within 1 to 2 days of receiving item started to have problems with it not staying on or going off on it 's own . However Amazon 's customer service was excellent and told me to return the item and a replacement would be sent . Not only was the replacement sent before I even returned the item but the return shipping was free . 	MP3 Player
The manual for this player is absolutely useless and their web site is no better . I tried calling their tech support and was told to leave a message . You guessed it - no return call . I 'm returning it today and replacing it with one that comes with a decent manual . 	MP3 Player
The only thing worse than no customer support is bad product and no customer support . This company believes that if they ignore the customer they can keep milking money from people who do n't read reviews . Well , slowly but surely the word will get out there , so keep on laughing all the way to the bank because one day the name Iriver will mean dirt . 	MP3 Player
I have a RCA Lyra RD1076A Mp3 player . The design is the same as the RD1076 , just more memory . It worked great when I first got it -LRB- about a year ago -RRB- but , now I 'm running into an internal memory problem where it will only hold around 20 songs . Yes , it does jam up from time to time , but new batteries fix that problem . Try as I might , after getting a memory card for it , I could never get it to play the songs on the memory card . Also , if you need the manual for the player , you have to find it online . Help troubleshooting ? Forget about it . That 's why I rate this product with only two stars . 	MP3 Player
it 's a great MP3 player for music ; if you are looking to play videos , I DON `` T RECOMMEND !! The format for video is MP4 and there is no software to convert videos within the package . Otherwise its a pretty good MP3 player with all its other features for music . 	MP3 Player
The controls are n't amazing but the product is very good\/reliable for the money . It 's very easy to plug into your computer and download music onto . The screen lights up in bright blue when you turn it on in the dark . It 's really a very good product for the money , I would definitely reccomend it . The only thing that I do n't like about it , is the controls make it hard to toggle between your music quickly . But really , for the money I do n't think you could possibly get anything better .

If I am going to be forced to use proprietary software for an audio and video player to work , it better be fantastic . This `` Songbird '' is for the birds . I must have installed and uninstalled and updated and repaired and downloaded again and etc. etc. . Importing media is a guessing game . You never know what it will like or spit back at you . And then on the unit itself , it is just a mess . Once you find the music you want , it might play . I also notice music skipping and jumping quite a bit . This could be from the shabby software trying to get it on the thing . Or it could just be the player . So why the generous three stars ? Because with some technical knowledge and the ability to edit and convert files and actually rework the unit , it 's just fine . In other words , delete all the useless software . Treat it as an external drive and create your own folders . Name them Music , Video , Photos etc. . This is a lot of work with music , as you have to create folders for each artist . So what I have done is dedicated the player to two artists `` Keane '' and `` Jason Mraz '' , since I listen to them the most , I have over 500 tracks between the two of them , and then there are the music videos and concert footage . So it fills up pretty well . But still keeping space for photos and taking photos or shooting video . I do not recommend deleting everything like I did , unless you want to take a chance . I had nothing to lose . The Songbird software is on the player itself . There are no discs for your PC . You plug it in your USB -LRB- with a really stupid combo AV cord -RRB- and the software should autorun ... if not , go into it like an external drive and double click on `` setup '' . But , like I said , I deleted it from the device . First of all , it 's out of date in need of an update . So you just download the full version from the Songbird Phillips site . Which I will try again maybe in the future . But for now , my clearing it out works for me . You do n't lose menu control as once I deleted the files , I click the reset to factory settings , and it does not delete your files , it just organizes the menu . The camera and video capabilities are impressive for fun and party use only . Not pro looking shots of anything . Just stuff you can upload to facebook and youtube etc. . It 's very light and the earphones have a nice fitting shape . But , it 's not an iPod or Flip Camcorder . It 's a combo of both , but cheaper . But you get what you pay for . -LRB- ... -RRB- The biggest plus here is the microSD slot . Just put files directly on the card and then put in the player , and you can shoot the Songbird .

I 've had my muvo slim for several months . -LRB- I also have a zen micro 5gb , currently in RMA process -RRB- but I like this one for the bounce-able flash drive so I can use it while I 'm running . I 've mostly loved it . I 've never used an ipod , so I ca n't compare it , but it holds a reasonable amount of music , is compatible w\/audible . com for audiobooks , is super easy to drag and drop podcasts into , etc. etc. . Everything 's been perfect until recently . I just started having problems with it shutting down mysteriously for no reason , or if it 's touched or if I yank the headphones or something just a little mid-play . I read that this has to do with the space between the battery and the battery door . Whatever the reason , it 's kind of a bummer . Otherwise , it 's a good player with a lot of features and it 's cheap . 	MP3 Player
This item does take some time and effort to learn how to use it right . Do n't expect it to be just `` plug and play . '' If you do n't use iTunes , be sure to download the free Audacity software , and also the Lame program mentioned in other reviews . When downloading Lame , be sure to use the `` free '' download site , there are several that try to lure you into paying for what you can get free . Once you have accomplished all this , it works quite well . 	MP3 Player
The Archos studio is the best value . Compared to the ipod it does the same thing and costs less . If the price is too high for the ipod then i suggest going for this . The ipod is a little lighter and alot more stylish . Cant complain though i get good quality , easy navigation , -LRB- weak -RRB- manual . To install this thing disregard everything the manual says and just plug it into your PC and wait for the computer to recognize the drive and then put in the cd then follow the recomended options . ...

Excellent sound quality . First when i brought it , i did not think it will be so good in performance . Only thing is you may have to buy a battery recharger and rechargable AAA batteries to save on buying AAA batteries all the time . The Player is just doing great for me . 	MP3 Player
This beautiful piece of technology suits my minimalist taste perfectly . No unnecessary features or buttons , no mucking around with drivers , just good quality sound and excellent portability . <p> So why not five stars ? The only things I miss is a resume function that starts at the point you power-down . And a self-recharging battery would be great . Next model perhaps . <p> As for the design , it does feel a little flimsy , and I strongly recommended buying the armband\/belt clip to protect it . For me , it has been perfectly reliable for about two months now . <p> I strongly recommend this product . I love it . 	MP3 Player
I recieved the pink mp3 in brand new packaging , gave it to my granddaughter and she has been listening to it ever since !

If you were like me , you 're wondering `` why hav n't I heard more or seen ads about this mp3 player that got such great reviews ? '' Well , I still do n't know why . I 'm the kind of person that buys only name-brand stuff , and I never heard of JetAudio . Here were some of my biggest worries about buying this player ... Hopefully , it 'll help you better decide what to get . <p> How 's the mp3 sound quality ? - It 's better than my roommate 's Creative MuVo 128mb -LRB- played the same songs with the same earphones -RRB- . There 's a clear difference in crispness & clearness , especially since the CW200 has a customizable equalizer . -LRB- Also , I did some research and found that JetAudio\/CoWon has been making digital audio\/video\/voice software since 1995 . They 're also one of the top companies in the Asias . -RRB- <p> How 's the FM reception ? - I have a Sony Walkman -LRB- Model SRF-M80V , receives AM\/FM\/Weather \/ TV audio -RRB- which has served me well with excellent reception . I was delightfully surprised that the CW200 's reception was just as good . <p> How 's the bass ? - Unfortunately , the supplied earphoness ar n't that great for heavy bass . However , I have an expensive pair of Sony earphones -LRB- sorry do n't know model # -RRB- . I also have the Creative Audigy sound card in my PC . I turned up the bass all the way on the CW200 -LRB- with the Sony earphones -RRB- and listened to `` Clubbed to Death '' from `` The Matrix '' soundtrack , and did the same with my PC . Sadly , the CW200 's bass was n't quite as booming , but nevertheless still satisfying -LRB- much better than my roommate 's MuVo -RRB- . <p> How 's the LCD screen ? - Well , it 's easy to read , even in its small size . Whenever you press a button , the screen brightens with a pleasant indigo light . You can also choose any font you have available on your computer -LRB- I believe you can have different languages displayed if you have the fonts -RRB- . <p> How 's the voice recording ? - Sadly , I have no experience with other voice recorders . I use it sometimes in lectures , and I find it clear enough to make out what the professor said , even in 400-student class sizes . <p> In conclusion , You get what you pay for , it 's a high quality product . It 's worth saving up for -LRB- do n't forget they also come in 64 & 128MB , which you can upgrade later to 256 -RRB- , do n't settle for the other mp3 players . 	MP3 Player
This item was supposed to be a Christmas present . I ordered it on December 17 and paid for 1-day shipping . It was -LRB- and is ! -RRB- showing `` In Stock '' , but for some reason I wo n't get it until possibly February ??? Come on ! 	MP3 Player
i dont know how long the battery last but its not 15 hours . i still love it . i wouldnt have bought any thing else . works good . small 	MP3 Player
This is a great alternative to the other mp3\/cd players out there . First of all , this supports id3 tags which show song title and author info ect . I burned a cd yesterday with over 115 songs on it and it picked up every signle one ! It plays beautifully and is a complete package . It includes ac adapter and car kit which is very helpful . One of the only drawbacks to this player is that it does not support multi-session burning . Even with that said this is still an awesome player . When esp is on -LRB- all the time in mp3 mode -RRB- , I can not even force it to skip ! With esp off with a regular cd I can make it skip but only if I 'm rattling it around . Great cd player and well worth the money ! 	MP3 Player
Sansa e280 appears to be a very well featured product . I looked at many mp3 and mp4 players , and this one appears to be superior in features , has a good price , and most importantly , is very well built . I examined the Meizu player , but for the price , the Sansa seems better and more solidly constructed 	MP3 Player
This item went on back-order right after I ordered it . It took 3 weeks to receive it and when I did get it , it did n't work . Because I wanted to have one for a long car trip , I had to go spend $ 20 on one at Radio Shack because this one that I ordered did not work and arrived WAY too late . 	MP3 Player
I have had this unit for about 2 years . So far it has held up really well . Only gripe I have is that it is made of cheap plastic ; the buttons feel a bit loose . I ` upgraded ' the firmware on my unit to the opensource Rockbox . It is way better than the original firmware . It offers lots more functions and improves battery life as well . In terms of size , it does not compare with the iPod or any of the newer harddisk-based MP3 players . I use it primarily with a cassette adapter in my car , so size is not such a big issue for me . But if you are going to carry this around on your belt all the time , you might be better off getting a more compact unit . 	MP3 Player
I went to Radio Shack and they tried to sell me a similar product for 60 dollars . I quickly declined and found my way to Amazon . After reading the reviews I really thought for the price -LRB- I bought a used one for two bucks -RRB- it was worth the risk . I am thrilled I went with it ! It was so easy to use . You plug it up , hit the smart scan and it automatically finds a channel . It was so simple I was shocked . Also , I was worried about it not working with my player as its an obscure brand - not even an issue ! I would highly reccomend this product to anyone . 	MP3 Player
First , the sound quality is poor . The earphone jack is proprietary and you must use their ear buds . Amazon recommends the Pyle buds which will not work . The ear hook is not removable . Is is uncomfortable and unreliable . I could not get it to stay on with any size buds even out of the water . The unit will not work with goggles that have thin straps unless you make elaborate adjustments to compensate . The list price is wildly exaggerated . In short , not worth the effort . 	MP3 Player
Simply put ... I love this MP3 player ! So simple to use ! I use it in my car and do n't have to lug around a case of CDs ! 	MP3 Player
A great mp3 player with 2 special qualities - it has a replacable battery and it supports the free RockBox software that has lots of games , colors , themes , all sorts of extra features . If you do n't feel stuck to I-Pod , I think you 'll like it . 	MP3 Player
When you 're in the market for a portable MP3 player - esp if you 're looking for anything over 1GB - then the first player that WILL spring to mind is the iPod . And while the iPod is a great product and has revolutionised the way we listen to music on the go - its is no longer the best portable MP3 player around . Enter Creative . Creative has always made technically sound , reliable and well-priced digital audio equipment , starting from setting the std in sound cards to making excellent computer speakers -LRB- sold as Cambridge Soundworks -RRB- . I have always found Creative products to be technologically superior and great value for money . So it is with the Zen . I have had my Zen Touch 20GB for a little over two weeks now and here are a few candid pros and cons of the player : - Pros : + + Excellent Battery Life : The player is slightly bigger and heavier than the iPod but even though the iPods run out of steam in abt 6 hours - the Zen will give you a solid 20 hrs + on a full charge . + + Superior Sound Quality : The stock pair of earpones are OK - but I use a pair of over-the-ear technics everyday . I also burn MP3s at 320 Kbps . + + Value for money : I bought my Zen touch for USD200 on amazon . Cons -- Interface : The interface is fiddly - sp . the touch panel which is oversensitive and takes a while to master -LRB- even after changing the sensor settings -RRB- . Not as snazzy as the iPod -LRB- but this is subjective -RRB- . Also , the panel buttons are becoming slightly loose and this worries me a bit . -- Form factor : this player IS bigger and heavier than the iPod . Also , the look\/appearance is not very chic - but I do n't care about this . -- Software : The creative software supplied with the product works only on Windows . Moreover it does not understand directory structures - so you must either uniquely name all tracks or fill in the MP3 tags yourself . But this is a problem with all portable HDD based players . Overall : a good buy . This is my first HDD player - I think there will be many more . 	MP3 Player
when i bought this product is was the best thing that ever happened to me ! i could record all my favorite songs off the internet . 	MP3 Player

I bought this MP3 player because I wanted to have an all-in-one media player that I could watch videos , listen to music and use as a GPS for navigation . Until recently I was also using the player as my alarm clock . The pluses are the audio and video quality and the GPS is pretty good . This size is a good size for watching videos and it does a good job streaming from Netflix . The music playing app does a good job with tags and I have no issues with the file or tag naming I had with my Sansa Fuze . The speakers are not all that bad and the ear buds are excellent . The minuses are that the player does not always register that I 've plugged it in to charge and there is no native support for ogg video . Occasionally I 'll have issues with WiFi which requires me to go into the settings and turn WiFi off then on again . The camera is usable but not a replacement for a good digital camera . Hopefully there will be more accessories available as this is a very nice player . If it were not for the charging issue this would be a 5 star player . 	MP3 Player
The Ravemp2200 is probably the best mp3 player on the market because it 's small and has the greatest memory capacity available in its price range , up to 128mb . It uses a USB connection to transfer files which is really fast and so much better than the parrallel port mp3 players around . They can take a couple minutes to transfer a song whereas the USB connection only takes a couple seconds . It can carry any kind of file , which means you can just use it as file transportion between home and work if you want . An excellent plus is the FM tuner that the popular Rio500 does not have . The Ravemp2200 can also accept 64mb smart media memory expansion cards ; the Rio500 can only take 32mb cards . The Ravemp is extremely small and light . It 's about the size of a credit card and as thin as a deck of cards . It has no moving parts so you can jump and bounce and jog as hard as you want without one skip . It 's more than small enough to fit in your pocket . You can also get a tape-deck adapter and make it work in the car . You can get 10 hours of play on just one AA battery and it just works great overall . Possibly the only drawback is that it does n't work on Macs but it has so many other pluses . 	MP3 Player
I 've been waiting for awhile for the Sansa e200 series ' prices to come down since they were released in 2006 . It 's tough to beat the features offered by Sansa e280 , including FM radio and voice recorder not to mention the music and video players . Using the media converter is a bit of a hassle to add photos and videos , but still more user friendly than iPod\/iTunes combo . Few nits to pick : availability of accessories are slim as Sansa never came close to being the iPod Nano killer . There are n't enough protective skins available in the market . The `` new '' non Liquidmetal back case is n't as elegant as original Liquidmetal case . The included lanyard looks nice enough but the metal collar is in the perfect spot to scratch the display so I took it off after the first day . 	MP3 Player
Item is lightweight , portable . Most of all , it works great !!!! Buy it ! 	MP3 Player
Player is small and has good UI . Time of playback also good for me . However earphones in the box just a junk - you need to consider a better one . With my Sennheiser HD 448 quality of playback is much better and acceptable . It ca n't even be compared with iPOD Touch but as small player with long life - it is fine . 	MP3 Player

if you want to view yor slide show on TV be prepared to turn your head through 90 degrees . the Flash Trax 80 has no facility to rotate images !!! I can not uderstand how a company can possibly market a unit which will not rotate images . I have no complaints with other aspects except it would not delete and would not run . mov files . i returned the unit for a refund . 	MP3 Player
It does exactly what it is supposed to do . The sound quality is a little off but it works fine . 	MP3 Player
I have a question : the technical data list for the iRiver SlimX iMP-400 CD\/MP3 Player said that it did n't include the remote control in the box . Is this true ? I read a review where was mentioned that without the remote control the CD player was really difficult to use , yet other reviews talk about the remote . Please tell me if the remote control is included with the CD player , and if not tell me if you sell it and at what price . Thanks for your assistance . 	MP3 Player
Bought these about a month or so ago and have been using them everyday ever since . I got alot of attention from them and sent the link to people because they work pretty well . I will agree with others in saying that you HAVE to put your goggles straps over the curved part or they will fall off , and I use the ribbed inserts . Water has a tendency to get in there and I typically have to stop 4 to 5 times every workout to adjust this but the soudn quality surprised me . It sounds like crap in the air but sounds awesome in the water . The chord would get tangled every now and then and then finally today they just quit on me at random . Overall , decent product but they seem cheaply made and I need ones that can handle daily usage in a rugged fast-moving water environment . I recommend them only if your head will be in the water the whole time , not for surfing or for walking around . 	MP3 Player
This mp3 player does everything I want plus fm radio . Caution , Ca n't fast forward video so break videos into workable chunks before loading . 	MP3 Player
I have been playing with this and it does have good quality and is an overall decent player the only thing that woulda put 4 stars on it if it was hellauv alot louder ; The eq is useless it does not increase the sound ; the sound quality is above average it 's alot like the cowon flat . The capicity is really 14.5 gbs which is not 16gb , I knew about ti but nobody ever says it in there reviews . This player is slim and tiny the screen can scratch so I would recomend a screen cover if that would really bother you . The menu is kinda wierd but easy to get through the now playing screen is cramped though not like it matters but when you try to get outta it it takes more than a couple of press to get back to the menu screen . I have not really tested the battery life but it does seem if you use the speakers on the player it drains the battery pretty fast so I 'd say its useless almost unless you want a group to hear one song then you 'll save alot of battery space cause I estimate about 3 hours via speakers , Maybe lol . there are many sony players that have a bad battery though hopefully I do n't have one of these , to really see if you have a bad battery just use the player and see how many days you use it and how many hours you spent listening , cause I 've heard you can get up to 20-30hrs thorugh normal music playing , I put mine on britness 2 insted of 3 to see if the battery last for awhile . Also this player does not have enough to power sennheiser full headphones I think it 's mostly geared toward earbuds and normal sized headphones cause I need a fiio e5 amp to get it to a decent level for my sennheiser HD438 's . all in all it 's a decent player with a decent overall sound and will do the job you ask which is play music , movies are not so great so do n't use it for them , just hope you get one with a good battery .

I spent a couple of weeks reviewing players , I wanted something like a Ipod suffle , but I wanted the controlls on the player instead of on the ear phones . This player provides all the features I wanted , with the exta feature of a screen so you can see what title is playing and the micro sd slot for added play space is great also . It works like a champ with widows media player or rhapsody and works great with audio books from -LRB- ... -RRB- . So user friendly , I ca n't even come up with one reason not to like this little player . 	MP3 Player
I asked for an MP3 player for Christmas , the only reason I wanted one was to listen to audiobooks on the way to work and during workouts . My husband decided this was the one I needed . It 's fine for music and the songbird program works pretty well , once you figure out how to use it . The pictures turn out pretty well , just as well as a cameraphone . Using audiobooks though is a HUGE headache , most places do n't recognize this MP3 player , the player does n't recognize . aa files only . mp3 . It is also not compatible with downloading from WMA . If you are looking for something for just music get this , otherwise keep shopping . 	MP3 Player
I remember when iPods first came out and I was way too broke to buy one . So I settled for a 512MB Rio , which seemed like much more than I needed . I passed the Rio onto my mother when I finally could afford a new MP3 player and my mother has had the Rio ever since , due to her very limited finances . When I ordered the GoGear Ariaz , I did so with updating my mother 's MP3 player in mind . It arrived here while she was on a visit and I pestered her for feedback everyday . She loved the sound and the storage space -LRB- from 512MB to 8GB is a HUGE jump -RRB- . She complained about the instructions being too ` technical ' and laughed at the robotic voice of the book reader . I know she 's still testing it out , BUT this seems to be an adequate little device for her needs . And although this was ` free ' for us at $ 70 it 's still reasonably priced and allows for a decent music going experience alternative to the omnipresent iPod . This is what my mom had to say : I like the storage space and the multiple functions , including the radio option . I have not yet tried the video function which has pre recorded information on it and mentions that it come with ear bud head phones which were not what was in the package . It contained standard head phones . The video clips were exceptional for such a small unit . The recorder works well and I experimented with it some what . I still have not down loaded pictures . The Test reader is too robotic when you listen to it . It is compact and easy to use once you figure out how to read the pictorial instructions which require complete knowledge of the device and if your a first time user it is confusing . 	MP3 Player
I Now own Five -LRB- 5 -RRB- of these super MPs ' 3 , plus 2 Travel Docks . Do not understand why CREATIVE stopped making this item . Being able to change out the battery is such a `` Plus '' . 	MP3 Player
I just got the unit today , nice little mp3 player . But I needed to record client recommendations for a web project . The format ends up being a . nvf . What 's that ? I tried downloading some software to convert nvf to mp3 to no avail . I 'd rate the unit a 5 if the voice recordings were in an mp3 format , a 4 if they were in a wav or wma , but a nvf ... please . Bottom line if you 're looking for an mp3 player\/mp3 voice recorder ... do n't buy it . But if you do n't mind playing your voice recordings on the unit or with the Creative software , buy it . 	MP3 Player
Very durable - I 've dropped it several times hard and it keeps on ticking . The navigation is very touchy which can be tricky . The accessories are very limited . The ear phones that it came with are big . They keep falling out of my ears when I 'm working out . I like how durable it is , I can always find smaller ear phones but I wish it was easier to navigate . 	MP3 Player
This is one of the best feature packed CD\/MP3 players for it 's price . No one comes even close . <p> Except for the non-backlit LCD display , I could not find any cons in this . <p> Excellent Sound , Car kit included , No Skipping at all when I run in my car . <p> Loking for a budget priced player and no brand preference , just go for it . You will not repent . 	MP3 Player
When my Zen Micro blew up on me a few weeks ago , I decided it was time to purchase a new MP3 player . I had long tried to avoid the iPod but after playing with a friend of mines new 8GB iPod Nano I decided I would get one . Fortunetly , I stumbled across the Sansa E280 by chance while looking for a good deal on the Nano . I decided to take a chance on this relatively unknown device and am now thrilled that I did ! While it is basically the same width and height as the Nano , it is slightly thicker which might bother some people but I still do n't even know it 's there while in my pocket . The Nano has a color screen which can be used to view photos and 8GB . It 's actually a nice little player but compared to the Sansa E280 it falls easily to a comendable second place . the E280 has an internal 8GB but there is a slot for a 2GB expandable memory disk ! It is very easy to connect to the pc as well . I am by no means a computer expert and I use Windows Media Player to store my music . When I first connected the E280 to the pc , it asked me did I want to sync the two , which I said yes to . Ten minutes later the Sansa was loaded with all my music , no problems what-so-ever . In addition to displaying photos as the Nano does , it also plays videos . When reading reviews I thought this was a clever gimic but nothing worth using on such a small screen -LRB- it is only slightly larger than the nano 's -RRB- . I put an episode of South Park onto it when I first got the E280 and was suprised by the quality . I still would n't recommend replacing your tv with one of these but it is actually far better than I thought it could be . The packaged video coverter works well . I literally dragged and dropped the episode into it and the it was converted and transferred to the E280 before my eyes . The fm radio is also brilliant . My Zen Micro had an fm radio that never really worked . I did n't expect much better from my new MP3 player but once again I was suprised . No problems picking up the local stations at all . The player itself fits comfortably in my hand . The only complaint I have about the physical player is the rotating wheel . At first I was disappointed with it as it felt very cheap , particularly when compared with the rest of the player . I got used to this very quickly and do n't have a problem with it anymore but I think it is worth noting all the same . The other complaint I would have about the player is that songs can not be deleted from the player itself , you must hook it up to the computer and manually remove them . All in all , I would highly recommend the Sansa E280 . Of the many MP3 players I tried out , this one really came out of top . It is beaten on size by the iPod , although the difference is near negligible . If your looking for a great little player packed with more features than you 'd know what to do with , pick a Sansa E280 up ! 	MP3 Player
This might be one of the older mp3 players , but it 's reasonably small , and the sound is loud and clear and it holds a lot of songs . The only problem that I 've had is with loading and then maintaining my mp3s using Microsoft Windows Vista . Instead , I use Ubuntu , a free Linux operating system , which I `` dual boot '' on my system with Windows Vista . Booting with the Ubuntu operating system , instead of with Vista , makes loading and deleting mp3s very easy . I love the SanDisk ! 	MP3 Player
I had a Cowon A2 for over 5 years until I left it on the plane after a business trip . Bummer , but figured it was a good excuse to upgrade to a new Cowon . Overall I love the freedom of the Cowon players . They can be used and shared by any amount of computer , do n't require software to transfer files , and can even transfer photos on my camera directly onto it while traveling through Europe . On my A2 I was restricted to 30GB of storage so I was happy to see 160GB storage for the X7 . The second major point of the X7 is the battery life . I just finished a 4 week trip through Europe and probably only charged it once after using it for videos or music pretty much every day . So to sum things up : Pros : Battery Life Storage Capacity Freedom of Use Sound Quality Large Screen Files Supported Cons : Slow\/Sloppy Picture Browser Sometimes annoying touch screen on small buttons Sometimes video and audio are off on the video player Hope this helps !

first i have never had an mp3 player before , the best of the genre ' would be a cassette recorder with fm . so we get the tiny tiny thing and the instructon book is near to a useful as saran wrap at hiding one 's body . ok dumb but you get the point . the cd disk that came with it will NOT load onto the computer , in fact it freezes the cd draw and i have had to manually open the drawer with a paper clip . so no help there on instructions . it took five days to finally figure out how to set fm stations . it was easy to make a voice recording but again those five days to figure out how to erase voice recordings . and , i have yet to get cd music onto the thing . had i mentioned tiny , with teeny tiny buttons and a screen that is so hard to read , especially when the blue backlight goes off . the sound quality is pretty good , being in the country fm stations normally had on our radio do not come in on this sansa , i guess a weak front end tuner . for city life with nearby fm stations there would be little issue . i guess i will like it when it is all figured out . so my 1 star is mostly based on not having the info at hand to devine how to use it . customer service was friendly but inept on how to handle this , no offer of a better instruction book . tsk tsk , for all mfrs to sell complicated devices with only bare instructions , what the heck could be the cost , esp considering ticking people off and getting bad reviews . just seems better if they would have consideration up front and be thorough .

I have tried this device numerous times in different cars with NO luck . I ca n't believe how badly this product worked . I love my iPod , just wish I could find a tuner to use it in my car . What a waste of money 	MP3 Player
I bought this about a month ago , but just finally brought it out tubing last weekend . I confirmed in my friends pool that it does float and keep water out beforehand . I have to admit , I was a little nervous , so I put my old phone in there to listen to the music . Sure enough , it floated and did everything I expected . On our tubing trip , I secured it to my tube with rope . I was n't messing around with it , so I secured it very well . I imagine it would 've floated just fine , I just did n't want to lose it . Again , I used my old phone just to be safe , but overall it was a great experience . People on tubes farther away from me kept asking me to turn it up , but the volume was perfect for me and my friends tied up to us . It did go under water several times while we were messing around , and it did n't leak or have any issues . I 'm still a little nervous to use my primary phone in there -LRB- just in case -RRB- , but I would recommend this to anyone ! 	MP3 Player
I 'm an avid distance runner and rely on my tunes for motivation , boredom relief and pure escape . -LRB- Sorry running purists , but I like it ! -RRB- So I 'm always trying to find something that puts out decent sound , can handle a little bit of sweat , and is intuitive enough that I can adjust controls by feel . This one had all of it , and more . I especially liked the playlist functions , readable screen size and shuffle , even though these features are pretty standard these days . But that 's all worthless if it does n't hold a charge . More than once I 'd be an hour into a run and the player would just go dead - funny thing was , I charged it all the way and the indicator bar showed fully charged before I set out . But more than once , it left me stranded , and to me - that 's worse than worthless . Good thing is it wo n't take up too much space in a landfill . 	MP3 Player
It worked great for the first tape that I copied , but quit working before I could complete the second one . 	MP3 Player
I bought this player because I was on something of a budget , yet I wanted more than 512MB of space -LRB- because I have about 30 + GB of music -RRB- . The nice color combination and sleek design , plus the bonus of playing movies and expandable memory made this a quick purchase . I recieved it quite fast , and overall I am very happy with it . PROS : plays movies , displays album art , plays WMA\/MP3 , ability to use as a transfer device for any media . CONS : does n't have support for OGG\/FLAC , the movies and pictures have to be transferred exclusively with the software that comes with it , sometimes when you delete an album , it stays on the album list unless you completely delete everything on it and refill . I 've had it freeze once or twice , but you just have to turn it off and on again . Overall , I have n't had any catastrophes yet in the 6 months I 've owned it . My roommate is going to buy one for herself as well . 	MP3 Player
Love the sansa clip . Here 's why . Form Factor - It 's very small and discreet File Formats - It will play just about anything Hackable - There are a few custom firmwares out there you can replace the stock firmware with just in case it dose n't play a particular file format Removable Storage - If the sansa dies then you do n't loose all your music and it can go up to 16GB Cheep - The 2GB model is only about 30 bucks and if it ever breaks or gets lost then it 's easily replaceable . Simplicity - Drag and drop music files on it from your desktop and it sorts them out with the ID3 tags . You also do n't need ID3 tags if you just want to sort by file or folder name Non-proprietary - Any micro cell phone charger can charge this and any 1\/8 '' headphone jack fits . There is also no propriertary software ; just drag and drop files in and you 're done . No album art but really that just takes up space for music . If you want a music player that does ONLY what it 's supposed to do REALLY well , then the sansa clip + is for you . Looks like a few engineers had their heads on straight and made a no non-sense mp3 player . The relative `` lack '' of features is really what I love about this little thing . There 's a beauty in simplicity and this little guy is simply beautify . 	MP3 Player
I have to admit I was skeptical when I bought this warranty a WHILE back . I thought I was throwing away 20 bucks . Now , as it turns out , I have had to use it and I am MOST pleased with the handling and payout on the claim . The whole overall process was pretty simple and they kept me informed of each step . I had almost enough -LRB- I had to throw in 4 bucks -RRB- to replace my daughter 's iPod Nano with an iPod Touch . Not only replacement but an upgrade to a new model with very little to almost no hassle ! I am going to put another SquareTrade warranty on her new iPod Touch . This outfit is for real and they care about their customers . I am buying all my warranties on my electronics from SquareTrade from now on and telling all my friends too ! Thanks SquareTrade !

In the past few years I started to stray away from Sony as I saw the quality of their products diminishing but lately I have been seeing a big turn-around for the positive . I had a 8gb Sony mp3 player and it worked fine but did not have the FM tuner & the built in speakers like this unit has . I have really enjoyed it so far and anticipate putting it to good use .

I received the Rio Carbon Pearl for my birthday in August and I completely love it ! As another reviewer said , the setup and software is easy to use and although I had n't previously had any MP3 player experience , I was quickly able to figure out how to get it up and running and start loading up both my music on CD , music from online downloads , and various podcasts and audiobooks -LRB- the latter two are the bulk of the material I have on my device -RRB- . I did end up replacing the headphones with an inexpensive pair of bigger , old fashioned outside the ear headphones because the ear buds were not too comfortable . The look and feel of the Rio itself is wonderful -- I love its sleek shininess and its tininess -LRB- that 's tiny , not tinny -RRB- and the way it sits in the palm of my hand . It 's better protection wise to use the little case that came with it , but the case itself is not very exciting and the Rio is much prettier outside of it . Its tiny size also makes it a great companion for walking and exercising . I never had or used an iPod so I ca n't compare the two , but the Rio is a great device for the price and I 'm extremely happy with mine ! 	MP3 Player

The Boxee Box Box is a long way from being a finished product but it gets better every month and the promise it shows is limitless . The biggest challenge with web based content is a unified player . This will continue to evolve . Because Boxee is open source there is continued development for function and content . Content can be added via repositories , periodically check out the Boxee website to add repositories . There is another open source project called Navi-X that has a repository that can be added to Boxee Box , Navi has lots of content via P2P sharing which adds a great deal to the Boxee Box . Even with what Boxee Box has to offer today it is one of the best values you will find and I have n't had cable \/ satellite in over a year . The whole family loves Boxee and the terms associated with Boxee are part f our vernacular now . You can also test drive Boxee as you can freely download it on Windows or Linux , Boxee Box does make it whole lot more convenient . Have Fun ! 	Media Player

This is the second one of these I bought . No , the first one was not bad . I bought the second one because I was so pleased with the first one . I might as well just do the review based on both since they are the same model . Right out of the box it is a simple hookup . Basic hookup : Plug in your network cable , HDMI cable and then the power adapter . It right away configures and lets you know that there is a firmware update available and it gives you the option of doing it or not . I let it and this takes a little while so be patient . When it is done it reboots itself . There is different firmware out there that is available if you are the tinkerer type of person like I am . Know this , I immediately found it on the internet , downloaded it , put it on a USB stick and reflashed the firmware . Much too cool ! This adds lots of features and allows one to get into the code and play ! It 's in Linux . Do a search for WD TV Live Firmware and you should find it . Hats off to B-RAD for coming up with this and all of those who help and support him . I should note that I use this to stream movies and music from my 4 Tb 's of server space , and media on my PC 's but also I purchased software named `` PlayOn '' . This software is installed on one of the PCs and allows Hulu , Crackle , Netflix , ESPN , etc. . . to be streamed . Please also note that some of these services require subscription and some do not . In a nutshell the box work great for me -LRB- It replaces and out performs a DLink DSM-520 media player I have -RRB- . WD support is much better than DLinks product support , B-RADD 's firmware has some really good forums supporting it , and PlayOn support is quite active and helpful too . Be aware for internet streaming you should have a bare minimum of 1.5 meg service . I give this box a 4.5 stars out of 5 . 	Media Player
I 'm on my second boxee box , since my first one died at the tender age of six months . My RMA just just died , also at the age of six months , and I 'm not sure if I 'm going to be provided a replacement by DLink - but they 're way unreliable . Mine freezes \* every day \* . It 's supposed to scan and update my media library when it 's idle , but what it does is lock up . My media watching generally starts with \* hold down power button for five seconds , watch light go out , turn back on \* . Sometimes it locks up when using apps . Rarely does it lock up when watching local video , but Youtube can crash it . The boxee team has also been pushing out mandatory updates , that tend to break little parts of whatever you like . One day connecting to SMB maybe gone . Another day weather is broken . It 's like having a car where the doors randomly fall off . Yay ! The reason why I 've stuck with it so long is that even tho the user interface is horrible , the remote letters are hard to see , and the hardware breaks all the time - is it 's still cheaper than the next alternative which is probably picking up a mac mini . And that 's probably what I 'll be doing when this one breaks . 	Media Player
Let me clear up one thing before I start this review : I AM NOT A MICROSOFT FANBOY . In fact , I was quite the opposite ; I was almost addicted to Apple these last couple of years . I have owned 3 iPods , and they all either became obsolete , broke , or got stolen . Tired of the madness , I decided to try something different . Hence , the reason for my buying of the Zune . One of the best things about the Zune -LRB- in my opinion -RRB- is the ability to customize the background . I love this option ... it makes the whole experience a whole lot more enjoyable . Another good thing would be the hard case surrounding it . Except for the iPod mini I once owned , all of my iPods were highly scratachable and delicate , and I would freak out if I left so much as one fngerprint on the back . Previous iPod owners may know what I 'm talking about -LRB- or it might just be me -RRB- but not having to buy a case immediately after purchasing the product was pretty cool . After nearly 3 years of incredibly uncomfortable Apple-issued headphones that broke after 2 months , the Microsoft-issued headphones were equivalent to a miracle . They are just as uncomfortable as Apple 's , but the sound quality was amazing !!! I 'm not the type to go and buy $ 300 Shure headphones -LRB- I 'm too broke to do that -RRB- , so I was shocked at how clearly I could hear the music -LRB- compared to how I heard music on the Apple headphones -RRB- . This is , of course , a matter of personal preference , but I really like them . People who listen to their MP3 players for long periods of time will absolutely hate these headphones , as they hurt like crazy after half an hour . Moving on ... The software was pretty easy to install . I 've heard tons of horror stories about this , but I downloaded mine onto a laptop , so I have no idea if that factored anything into it . That said , the interface is pretty nice , but I kind of miss iTunes for various reasons that I 'm not going to go into here . Getting my iTunes library off of my Mac and onto my PC and into my Zune library was incredibly easy , if not seemingly interminable . Art and videos look great on it . I also like the radio feature . Things I really hated about the Zune : The fact that it only WORKS ON PCs . Every time I use a PC , I 'm reminded of just how much I hate them . The viruses , constant security updates ; in other words , things I had grown used to not having on my beloved Mac . -LRB- I am such an Apple lover . I 'm even obsessed with the actual fruit ! -RRB- Also the fact that it turns into a near useless pretty brick when it 's connected to said PC . And the fact that the selection in the Zune marketplace is so limited -LRB- I do like the subscription you can get for it -RRB- . Final Verdict : A great 1st generation music player !! The color -LRB- I bought red -RRB- was incredibly pretty , art , videos , pictures , and other things looked awesome on the screen -LRB- which looked colossal compared to my 5.5 G iPod -RRB- . Radio was nice to have . Although it wo n't convert me to a fulltime PC user , I 'll probably use this player for a LONG time . 	Media Player
This will play all the files you can throw at it except for ISO and TS . You have to know where the movie is and play the right VOB file for DVD file playback . Probably better for traveling with hard drive to a lake house than making it rwork for a living in the living room bed room or rec room . 	Media Player
I wanted an MP3 player mostly for the Bose system in my car using an FM transmitter and occasionally in my home Bose -LRB- no , not the one made for the ipod -RRB- . So , first I bought an ipod shuffle . I tried it in the car and compared the sound quality by switching back and forth between a CD and the ipod with the same song on both . The ipod sounded very muffled as if throwing a heavy blanket over the speakers . It was terrible . I then tried the same thing in my home Bose with the same bad results . I returned the ipod the next day . I thought that maybe all MP3 players would be the same poor sound quality and I almost gave up on the idea of an MP3 player in my car . But , then I thought I would try one more time with the Cowon iAudio 20GB X5L . Again I compared the X5L to a CD with the same song in the car . I could hardly believe my ears . There was almost no difference in sound quality between the two sources . The ear buds also have a decent sound . Needless to say I kept the iAudio . The sub-pack that comes with the X5L has jacks for DC charging , USB , line in , and line out . Some people find this annoying having to plug in the sub-pack each time to do any of the above . I also have the cradle that has the same jacks . I keep the USB plugged into the sub-pack and the DC charger plugged into the cradle . I also keep an RCA cord plugged into my home Bose when I want to plug in the player in that device . For me , this method is convenient and I do not have to move cords for whatever I want to do . I love the EQ and the other 4 sound settings . I can customize the sound according to whichever device I have it plugged into . Also , you can store up to 5,000 tunes which is far more than I will ever use . There is a little joystick on the front that controls volume , next or last track , fast forward or fast reverse , and pulls up menus . The play , record , and off buttons are on the side . The joystick takes some practice , but is easy to use . Some people prefer the ipod\/itunes method to put music on their MP3 player . I prefer the iAudio\/Jetshell . When converting a prerecorded CD to MP3 using jetshell simply click on Code and it will get the Artist , Title etc from the internet . That way you do not have to name each track . Of course , you can still edit that information if you want . Then you can move them to the IAudio . However , I simply go to Windows Explorer then Copy and Paste all the tunes to the iAudio . The whole thing is very simple and fast . Plus , I like being able to create folders and sub-folders and name them whatever I want in Windows Explorer . The case seems very well built , sturdy and does not look as though it would scratch easily . The long-life battery makes this player a little thick and slightly heavy . But , I have no problem with that . I have never run down the battery , so I just assume the rated 35 hour life is close to being true . -LRB- This refers to the \* L \* version . The regular X5 is rated at 14 hour battery life -RRB- . I can not comment on other features either since I have not used them . Like the recording or video . As I said , I only use the X5L for music in my car and home . Pros : Sound Quality , Long Battery Life , Drag and Drop Files , FM Radio , Picture Viewer , Video Playback , Recorder . Cons : No Speaker . Bottom Line : Much better than the ipod . 	Media Player
I got my archos av500 for christmas this past year and I really do enjoy it a lot . I use it a lot as well . I have n't had much problem with it . It has downloaded everything , and recorded everything how I expected , and wanted it too . Then I go to look at the clock ... and it is wrong . I have set it many times , but it seems to change and have the wrong time a lot . So that is the only glitch I have found , otherwise I love it ! 	Media Player
Beware this Zune has a moving part hard drive unlike a Ipod where it is a solid state hard drive . Other than that it is a fine product , but not reliable . 	Media Player
I was a little discouraged about getting a Zune at first , but like so often happens , I found it on Amazon for a price that I could n't pass up . I went ahead and bought it and when I received it I took a little time to figure it out , but once I got it all program up and running I found that it more than met the mark with what I was looking for . With 30 GB worth of room on it , I 've got photo album after photo album on it along with about 3,000 songs and I 'm down from 27.7 GB to 24.3 -LRB- approx . -RRB- . The only thing that I do n't like about it is that the battery seems to discharge while its on or off , so I 'm constently charging it . Other than that , I have used it about every day since I 've had it and that 's been about a month . Great product , get the battery situation worked out and it would be a perfect product !

As this is my first media player streamer I was very skepticle on which to purchase and did alot of research . It was between this and two others . My brother in law bought one and said he loved it so I decided to bite the bullet and go for it . I purchased a refurbished one and absolutely love it so far . I watch everything from TV shows to 1080p HD movies to regular DVDs . It coverts anything and everything I throw at it and its so easy to use . And even if I play a crappy movie that has the audio sync off , the Boxee has quick and easy adjustment settings that I can make the movie audio sync right in the middle of the movie if I want to . Or if I want subtitles on or off simple click away . This thing is awesome and I like it better and easier to use then my BluRay player . I am absolutely amazed at how clear the 1080p is when I stream it . I dont know what some of these other people are whining about but I love love love this thing . I use it everyday . The double sided remote is so easy to use . I watch alot of my own movies on here and not stuff over the internet but it works with everything and is simple and easy to use and navigate around with and perfect having that querky keyboard one one side so you can search for things super quick . My mom wants me to buy her one and stream everything to her from my room so that is my next plan . Ill review back when I do but I see no issue ... 	Media Player
I bought this specifically to share local files and get Netflix and other online media sources via a 10 year old HDTV , still excellent in all respects but for lack of HDMI and 1080p . It supports 480i\/480p and 1080i video . After trying the Roku XDS , which could n't deliver anything above 480i -LRB- since my TV does not support 720p -RRB- , I 'm delighted I found this little media PC from Western Digital . First , the setup process . It was dead simple . I 'm a nerd and do n't mind going through menus , in fact I live for the excitement of manually setting up a new device . With the WD HD Live Plus there was n't much work to do . I did have one minor issue - because I was connecting to a 1080i display I had to go through initial setup and change of video source setting by first connecting the WD HD Live to my TV via the composite cables , and the accompanying audio signal to digital -LRB- all of my audio and video is routed through a Denon AVR -RRB- . Once these settings were made and I reconnected and rebooted , it automatically set up an internet connection -LRB- via ethernet -RRB- and updated the firmware . I was immediately browsing my local SMB shares , logged into Netflix in a jiffy , and tested several channels through Playon . Operationally , it takes a bit to warm up after turning it on , be patient . I 'm not nuts about the interface , but its not bad . I was able to easily locate my media by navigating the file structure , internet services and settings . Its biggest detriment is that the home menu does not revert back to a default state . This prevents the ability to program sequences in universal remotes to go automatically to Netflix , for example . A drawback but not a big one . Its played multiple audio and video formats , has n't balked at a single piece of media yet . Netflix video quality is not bad , given that netflix streams at 720p and my set does n't support it . Much better than the quality I received from Roku XDS -LRB- which is a great device , by the way - but not for this older set -RRB- . Playon was n't bad either . The few blu-ray videos I had converted to . mp4 looked great , as did several DVDs . For $ 90 I expected a few glitches and workarounds given the specifics of my situation . After reading many other reviews I certainly expected something not to work right . Everything did , not one glitch prevents me from giving this little gadget an excellent review . For what I wanted the WD HD TV Live is perfect . Its breathed new life into an old display . Last but not least , my first HDTV is finally connected to the internet . 	Media Player
I expected to use USB interface to load photos and videos . The bad news is that the speed of USB interface is too slow . It can only support bitrate lower than 800kbps . It will be stuck once the bitrate of the video is higher . That does n't make sense . I emailed this problem to service , no response . Several months later , the LED for power indicator did n't work anymore . It is really a bad experience . 	Media Player
I bought this unit to replace a Klegg MediaShare player that I had been using for a little over one year -LRB- it was ok but limited , especially for new video formats . -RRB- The WDTV Live has handled just about everything I have thrown at it . The only video not supported was an AVI home video created using Sony Vegas Movie Studio 6 - some kind of unique AVI codec I guess . The WDTV Live handles both old and new formats quite well . The navigation is pretty smooth and easy to learn . I am connected to my home network that has both Windows XP and Ubuntu Linux computers plus a couple of WD MyBookWorld devices . No problem extracting videos from anything on the network plus a USB hard drive directly connected . Nice that the WDTV Live acts as a server for the attached USB device so it can easily be used as a backup , etc. . HD support is super . No problems at all with the HDMI output . Great little device ! I am happy so far -LRB- been using it for a month now . -RRB- 	Media Player
i HAVE 3 ZUNE PLAYER ALL REALLY WORK , IT 'S JUST THE COMPUTER PROGRAM FOR ZUNE CRASHED ON BOTH MY COMPUTER THAT RUN WITH WINDOWS XP . TRY AS YOU MIGHT YOU WILL NOT GET THE PROGRAM TO WORK AGAIN YOU CAN NOT ERASE THE OLD ONE AND NOTHING HELPS . SO I AM BUYING A NEW COMPUTER JUST TO RUN ZUNE -LRB- GOOD TRICK MICROSOFT -RRB- . IF YOU DO HAVE ZUNE WORKING NEVER UPLOAD UPGRADES FOR ZUNE . I EXPECT A FIX FOR THIS PROBLEM BUT SEE FOR YOURSELF THERE HAS BEEN NONE FOR YEARS !!! 	Media Player
We purchased a roku box for our living room , we LOVE our roku with the only down side being that roku does n't support YouTube . So when we sprung for a second box for a second tv in our house , we thought we would try something that did all the programs including YouTube . Hence , our purchase of the Sony Media Player . Initially it has some fancy lighting and a somewhat unique remote . But in the end , the remote is as non user friendly as the software interface . The remote buttons are n't exactly clear as to their purpose and require some fidgeting to figure them out . The interface of the software itself mimics the sony play station which in itself I think is not nearly as user friendly as xbox or the roku 's menus . For older people , it 's near impossible to teach them the advanced way of navigating through the menus that are not intuitive at all . In the end it was worth not having YouTube in order to have a really user friendly , clear system interface like the Roku box . Many people would say , well what 's the difference between buying the box and just using the xbox live ? Well the roku you pay one flat cost of approx $ 50 and the xbox you pay $ 60 a year to renew your live membership , so for me it made sense ! 	Media Player
I would definately recommend this product for purchase . I wanted a converter to play downloaded computer movies from my external . This devise does not play every format , but close to it . Even better , it was a third of the price comparred to the rival Western brand . Overall , good product for the money . 	Media Player
User friendly . I have played mov , mp4 video and audio , jpeg , mp3 and wav files . Worked perfectly . Makes a nice jpeg slide show with music . Keeps my autistic grandson occupied . 	Media Player
I bought this at Best Buy not knowing what it had to offer -LRB- other then it had music , pictures and videos . -RRB- Since I have so much feedback for this player , I 've divided it into three sections . Good , Bad , and the Ugly . Good : Great big screen , case is sturdy , interface and menu is easy to use . The music is very clear and along with the big screen to playing videos . Also has WiFi built it to send songs , pictures , and videos to other Zune holders . Software is OK , but I 've never come across any software that is perfect . Bad : Battery life could be ALOT better . Do n't waste your time putting on full movies , because chances are you wo n't be able to finish them . WiFi is useless . Kills battery and useless unless you know or spot someone holding their Zune . Just leave it off -LRB- buzzkill for the battery if left on . -RRB- Until Microsoft creates another firmware update to allow Zune players to connect to the Internet -LRB- Zunes Marketplace more likely -RRB- to download music will give its WiFi more of a real use . Ugly : We seem to see a lot of holes in Microsoft 's products . Aside from poor battery life , useless WiFi , and 50 % of the songs that are on the Zune 's Marketplace ca n't even be shared yet , its overall rating it OK . There is room for improvement , but only time will tell if this player can be the next Ipod killer -LRB- which its not right now , but in the near future it might . -RRB- 	Media Player
There are a few things that make this stand out from an iPod Video . 1 - The screen . The screen is huge and watching video in widescreen is awesome . Everyone comments on how great the picture is , it looks like a mini-HDTV . 2 - Radio . The radio tuner is very powerful and has the ablilty to tell you the station name and even the song that is currently playing . 3 - Wifi Sharing - This is pretty limited as of now considering you can only keep the songs you share with other people for 3 days , but it 's still a cool idea and could get a LOT better with firmware updates . 4 - Pictures viewing in widescreen . It make pictures a thousand times better ... Better than iPod hands down . Other than that everything is at least up to par with an iPod for the most part . It does n't have some of the basic features you would expect , such as a clock\/alarm , or any programs for that matter . I believe these will be added later with firmware updates . The software for the most part is easy to use , but not as easy as it should be to install . Afterall , this is a Microsoft product on a Micrsoft O\/S , there really should n't be any flaws at all , but there are a few minor ones . Overall this thing is great , works for all your multimedia needs . 	Media Player
First of all ; I have been playing with these type of devices for quite a while now . Anything from the first DivX players -LRB- like the Avelink player -RRB- , the Popcorn Hour -LRB- still the most solid device out there -RRB- , DreamBox , HTPC -LRB- Windows Media , Boxee -RRB- , etc. . In my setup I use a 42 '' Philips 1080p TV , and a Yamaha HIB for audio , all over HDMI . Setting this device up was easy , but I can imagine that people unfamiliar with Boxee might want to play first with the regular PC , Mac or Linux version of Boxee . The manual is not going to give you any info on how to operate the device , but it 's relatively intuitive . \* Compared to Boxee on a -LRB- HT -RRB- PC -LRB- Windows 7 -RRB- ; I found the Boxee Box to be much more stable right out of the box . The box is also a lot smaller than expected . The RF remote is great , no more aiming needed - although I do hold it upside down every now and then and wonder why the button responds differently than expected . The remote for my Windows version -LRB- which has been great -RRB- is far far far behind compared to this remote . Starting the device is pretty fast , and it is not making any noise -LRB- fan -RRB- that bothers me . Playback works very well -LRB- 1080p -RRB- for numerous file formats I have tried -LRB- most commonly used container formats : AVI , MKV , M4V\/MP4 -RRB- - it ran out of sync only once -LRB- I pressed pause\/play a tad too often -RRB- . Playback from a Windows or Samba shared folder works great . Zero issues with HDMI -LRB- Windows has it 's issues with HDMI and audio pass through -RRB- . Great connectivity -LRB- Wifi , wired network , Audio\/Video , etc -RRB- . Issues I ran into : No NetFlix -LRB- yet -RRB- ... : -LRB- My Boxee plugins did not seem to work -LRB- not exactly a drama -RRB- . Caching of thumbnails and movie info is rather slow . Then again ; it was n't perfect on the Windows version either . Weird shape of the box - this initially kept me away from buying this box , but once I did see one in real life , I realized that it 's a very tiny box which meant that I could give it a place in my home theater setup . I 'd still prefer a more conventional design . \* Compared to my favorite Popcorn Hour : For my purposes , the Popcorn Hour is still a better overall device , but the Boxee Box is getting very close , and I expect -LRB- with future updates -RRB- it to surpass the Popcorn Hour . Specially when NetFlix becomes available . The Popcorn Hour is significantly slower in booting , and Boxee already has quite a few nicely integrated options that simply do not work or do not work well on the Popcorn Hour . \* Compared to the Roku HD : There is no comparison . My Roku is only used for NetFlix and that 's it ... I can not recommend any Roku box at this point at all , unless you only need it only for NetFlix and do not want to spend $ 199 on the Box or about $ 175 on the Popcorn Hour . 	Media Player
I purchased this device along with the MICCA MPLAY -LRB- http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/gp\/product\/B002XVBAKI\/ref=oh_o00_s00_i00_details -RRB- and high hopes for both devices . I planned on getting one for my kids and the other for my office at work . The MPLAY definitely met my expectations , where as this one did not . I used a 320 GB WD Scorpio Black HDD and did n't have any problems loading movies onto it . The problem came when attaching the Micca Slim to the TV with a HDMI cable . It took it a little while and finally got up and running . COOL !! Everything is good to go . I even watched a few movies on it . The remote is pretty much useless , so it made things more frustrating . Finally , after 5 minutes of trying to turn the device off , it shutdown . The next day I went to turn it on and nothing came up . The blue `` power '' light came on and the red HDD light flashed , but quickly went away . I tried to mess with it for about 30 minutes and did n't achieve anything . I finally decided to take it to work with me and try to hook it up to my 2nd monitor at work . Same thing . So instead of trying to go into further troubleshooting , I am returning the item . I should n't have to do this much work to get this work . My opinion ... you 're better of with the MICCA MPLAY . Good Luck ! 	Media Player
I was a bit skeptical at first , but I 've been extremely pleased with my Zune . Right out of the box I was able to install the Zune Marketplace software , download , sync , etc. within minutes . What absolutely sold me was the way the menus are laid out on the device . I no longer have to click `` Music -RRB- Artist -RRB- Album -RRB- Song '' to enjoy a quick tune , and I 've used the radio much more than I thought I would -LRB- sometimes you just need a break from the songs you 've heard time & time again -RRB- . Some features -LRB- such as being able to sync wirelessly -RRB- are n't present yet , but those should be coming out soon as updates . This is a solid first start , and I 'm looking forward to future updates and versions of the device . I highly recommend it ! 	Media Player
I was excited about the prospect of streaming HD1080 movies using Boxee Box . Sadly , it is a product in evolution . First , it decided that my internet connection was too slow and I could only stream at 720 . It is unstable , frequent freezes required reboot of my system . Of late , it ca n't find my internet connection though an ethernet cable runs from my router to the box and now the remote control has stopped working . Very disappointing - unless you get off on frustrating performance please save your money and wait until the product is out of beta . 	Media Player
Only black screen when turning on . I have been using Boxee Box without problem . Also with 1.5.1.23679 -LRB- 7th Feb -RRB- . But now when I turn on , only black screen appear . I use same HDMI cable that came with the unit and I used another one . When I turn on , I noticed that something happen in the TV as it detect the signal . But nothing else . I try going to factory reset . The logo is yellow , but nothing appear in the screen . Is there any hard reset I can do my myself . I live in Argentina . I have no local support and can not send the unit to you . If you look in the web `` Black screen of death '' you will see there is an unsolved issue that happened without any explanation . I WILL NOT RECOMMEND THE PURCHASE OF THIS PRODUCT . I AM VERY VERY SAD . I discarded the bad reviews before buying this product because I thought those were special cases . PLEASE BE INFORMED THAT THIS PRODUCT IS NOT A PC . YOU CAN NOT FIX IT even though you do a factory reset . You have to drop it . 	Media Player
1 . Poor sound quality -LRB- and I 'm not an `` audiophile '' 2 . Needs a clip to hold the central piece -LRB- clipped to shirt collar , etc. -RRB- otherwise the extra weight tends to pull the earbuds out of my ear . 3 . The `` rewind '' mechanism is n't very smooth . -LRB- This is n't a show stopper , but # 1 above is . I 'm returning this . -RRB- 	Media Player
Out of all the media server type devices , this one seemed to be the best reviewed so I took a flyer and bought it . It is not the simplest thing to set up . I had to install , uninstall and download and reinstall the latest versions of both the device firmware and PC based software . This may had to do with the fact I was using Vista . Once I got it all settled in though , I find it works great . I have the device on the 2nd floor of my house and my wireless router is in my basement and this does n't seem to create any issues . I did notice recorded TV shows that are in uncompressed 2gig per hour formats did not stream over well , compressing them to iPod TV size makes them work flawlessly . I am using it on a 25 inch , non-HD tv so I ca n't speak to how well the HD works . Overall I am very happy with the purchase though and would recommend to anyone looking to have a Tivo-like device . 	Media Player
Before I had this player , I had a Creative media player and I have extensive experience with the iPod brand media player as well . This player blows the competition out of the water . It has great performance -LRB- battery and all -RRB- and excellent audio quality . The only complaint I have is the fact that it does n't have a customizable Equilizer , but it does have some preset setting . Video quality is great , not quite as high resolution as it 's iPod and creative counterparts , but the larger screen makes up for it . It 's high enough resolution that on a movie I can read the small green words that pop up right before the movie . -LRB- I 'm not sure what the name of this screen is , but the words are really small ... maybe a federal warning screen ? -RRB- I bought a zune around Christmas time and since then 6 of my friends that have seen it have either bought one or are seriously considering it now . The software is ALRIGHT , I know someone who had some troubles after the first insallation , but those were repaired with a second installation . I do n't like that it 's not compatible with WMP 12 , however the zune software is SO similar that I 'm not going to throw a hissy fit . -LRB- but it 's still dumb -RRB- Marketplace seems to have a good selection , but still lacks videos . I hated the point system at first but now I 'm growing fond of it , I do n't feel as guilty spending `` microsoft points '' on songs . What else am I going to use `` microsoft points '' for ? -LRB- In other words it 's a clever marketing strategy on microsoft 's behalf . -RRB- To sum things up , the Zune is GREAT alternative to the dominating iPod market and I love watching the iPod lovers squirm at the sight of it . : -RRB- -LRB- They always come up with something stupid to say about it `` Uh ... the name ... uh ... Zune ... thats stupid . '' -LCB- like iPod is better ? -RCB- -RRB- I 'd also like to throw in that as of yet there 's no good software for the linux community to use the Zune with ... sucks , but we 're used to it . And I said almost life changing because I use it everywhere and for just about everything . 	Media Player
Got the Zune for Christmas . Wanted an iPod , but what the heck , should not be much difference , eh ? Oh , how wrong I was ! Software was NOT easy to use , despite what some reviewers have said . Zune Marketplace sucks big ones . You need to prepay to buy points . Must buy points in dollar increments , but songs do n't cost exact dollar amounts , so you end up with a few cents here & there that you wo n't be able to use fully until you buy a bunch of songs . I wo n't be around that long ! As for the Zune itself , it is clunky to use and looks like a toy . I 've had enough of it . I bought myself an iPod and the Zune is on sale on Craigslist . Not one call on it . I guess others are smart enough to avoid it . Do yourself a favor - buy the iPod . It is no more expensive , but it 's built how a music player should be built , and the iTunes software and music store blow away Zune 's ! 	Media Player
I 've owned a 1st generation 30gb Zune since the first of 2008 . I 've applied all available software\/firmware updates . It has more working against it than for it . But I use it everyday because I do n't want to risk losing my iPod Touch . The main complaints are the horrible software ; the USB 1.1 transfer speed -LRB- takes literally hours to load movies -RRB- ; the lack of any ability to organize videos in any way and songs only into basic groups ; the way it does n't remember where you left off while listening to songs in a very long list ; no way to delete files from collection but keep in player -LRB- deletes without asking when re-connecting -RRB- ; scrolling and more scrolling , clicking and more clicking -LRB- no shortcuts -RRB- . It 's not all bad : Good audio quality ; video is passable but nowhere near the Touch ; good size and comfort ; good battery . Like I said , this is my everyday player but if I did n't have my iPod to fall back on , I 'd be disappointed . 	Media Player

After careful consideration of sites like Napster and other download music file `` To-Go '' types . The iAudioX5 will not be recognized or music files -LRB- DRM -RRB- will not play . Even when the firmware is upgraded to 2.11 _ b1 . Also if you have Windows XP the drive has to be formatted in FAT32 and the max partition is 32G leaving a wasted partition that the iAudioX5 firmware will not use for file storage because it is designed for a single partition . So if you need to `` wipe '' the iAudioX5 drive Windows 98 -LRB- SE -RRB- can do this upto 2T in FAT32 or a third party software on Windows XP OS -LRB- although it needs to port through USB2 .0 as well -RRB- . NTFS formatting will not work ! as the firmware is written to look at FAT32 sectors . Other than that this unit has many features and functionality that surpasses any iPOD ! 	Media Player
"Pros : + very small and minimalist design , akin to the Apple TV . It 's square and flat . Measures 3.6 x 3.6 x 0.8 tall . + plays RMVB @ 1024x576x24 , 1024x576x30 , or 800x600x30 + $ 20 cheaper than WDTV + great support for various music formats , including the lesser known FLAC -LRB- free loss-less audio codec -RRB- , OGG , and APE + retains the look and feel of the WD TV interface -LRB- mostly -RRB- Cons : - no HDMI output - no MKV support - 1 USB port The $ 20 price difference does not make this an attractive buy when compared to its fully-featured big brother , the popular <ahref=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001JZFQU4/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/190-7276113-0516402""> Western Digital WD TV HD Media Player </a> . The only reason you might buy this instead of the much better WDTV is for RMVB support , but the trade-off simply does not add up . A `` wide variety of file formats '' is a subjective term here . WD added RMVB support , but took away MKV , one of the player 's biggest selling points . RMVB is only useful if you intend to watch a lot of internet-downloaded shows from mainland China\/Hong Kong , as the low CPU requirements for this format makes it a popular choice for encoders there . For hi-def encodes , MKV is the format of choice . For audio , the only new format is APE , which is very rare and unlikely to be of use to the vast majority of users . You also lose AIFF support with the Mini , but that is unimportant . It 's advertised by WD as being `` small enough to take with you '' , but the WDTV was already compact enough to transport . The Mini flew in under the radar , just like the WD TV originally did , but it 's a puzzling new addition to the product line considering the existence of the superior WD TV and the anticipated release of the WDTV 's successor . WDTV owners have been clamoring for network support for a long time , and I 'm surprised WD went and devoted resources to making this new , under-powered -LRB- and un-asked for -RRB- product instead of putting all their efforts into bringing the WDTV 2 to market earlier -LRB- officially called the <ahref=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002KKFP9Y/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/190-7276113-0516402""> WD TV Live Network-ready HD Media Player </a> -RRB- . If you need a player right now and do n't need RM\/RMVB support , I recommend the WDTV instead of saving the $ 20 here . If you can wait 2 months for the release of the WDTV 2 , then wait . It will have network support -LRB- wired -RRB- and DTS-downmix -LRB- so you do n't need a separate audio receiver -RRB- , 2 very big and important additions requested by users . If WDTV 2 retains RMVB , it will be the best of both worlds . UPDATE : 10\/30\/2009 . The WDTV Live is out now . It 's networked and WiFi enabled -LRB- via third party USB dongle -RRB- . If you need RMVB playback and networking , you may wish to consider the excellent -LRB- if homely -RRB- <ahref=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002MCZJ3C/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/190-7276113-0516402""> ASUS O !

Having only Linux at home I had been looking for a few features in any portable player : Any music format support -LRB- FLAC , OGG , MP3 , Wav -RRB- use standard file transfer to load songs Long battery life . The I audio does deliver on all these points . It will for a long time playing mp3 , FLAC is more intensive on cpu but still I get from 4-7hours . Love the way it works and 60 GB is plenty of space . 	Media Player
Hi , everyone ! I work at The Sharper Image here in Cincinnati , Ohio , and I 'm intimately familiar with the AV500 . I should be ! I own one and sell them . So i 'm off the clock and comission is n't an issue ... I 'm going to touch base first on some aspects of the Archos that have n't probably been discussed , and comparing it to the OTHER pretty cool portable tech item you 're all probably familiar with , the current-gen iPod Video . Basically , this is THE choice for you if you want portable video on the go , with a bigger screen than the iPod Video , and better battery life to boot . SOUND : The AV500 -LRB- and AV700 -RRB- offer user-manageable Bass , Bass Boost , Treble and Balance options , most of which the iPod does not , and otherwise opts for preset EQ settings . The Archos DVR units -LRB- AV500 , AV700 -RRB- offer built-in speakers , too . While not terribly loud , you 'll be pleased as punch with them in a quiet room . As with the iPod , I chucked the offered earbuds as my ears are way , waay too small to wear them comfortably , and besides , pack-in earbuds are almost always pieces of junk with electronics . I opt rather for my Shure E3c earbuds of which you can peruse at your own time later on Amazon . -LRB- I reccomend it HIGHLY . -RRB- Lastly , yes . . the Archos can be used as an . MP3 player , with what I personally feel is better bass than the iPod , even on it 's default setting . It IS compatible with iTunes ! -LRB- Meaning it can copy playlists , but the interface of the Archos is NOT similar to the iTunes interface . Rather , it uses a ROOT form , much like , I assume Windows computers do . . -LRB- I 'm a Mac user myself . -RRB- VIDEO Of course , here is where the AV500 -LRB- and AV700 -RRB- truly shine , and with good reason . You get about 41\/2 , 5 straight hours of playback of whatever movies you 'd like ! It works with the . AVI file system , and records as such . You can convert internet video files to Divx-ready . AVI with Quicktime Pro if you so wish . Instead , I opt most often than not to really use my Archos for a DVR ... -LRB- oh , and to clarify , the iPod Video works natively with Quicktime . MOV . To me yes . . the Ipod has a leg up here , but the pluses outweigh the minuses for me with the Archos . Why is that ? ... The pack-in bypass cradle that comes with your Archos is a self-powered -LRB- AC pack -RRB- unit that you use to bypass existing video feeds . For example ; you run your cable to your VCR , then ` OUT ' with AV jacks to your television set . You 'd connect your Archos cradle to the ` OUT ' AV jack on your VCR , then ` IN ' from the cradle to the TV . This then allows for normal TV\/DVD viewing , and acts as I call it , a ` passive reciever ' for the Archos . In other words , the Archos is a leech on whatever device you connect it to . . wether it be a VCR , cable box , or DVD player . As long as your unit uses standard yellow -LRB- Video -RRB- , red and white -LRB- left and right stereo -RRB- AV jacks , you 're in like Flynn here . What does this allow ? Well , absolutely any DVD you own -LRB- AND may I add , the upcoming Blu-ray players too , as long as they have those afformentioned AV jacks , natch -RRB- is recordable onto your Archos for use and playback any time you want . I record old family videos to the unit for later archiving to my computer , and also . . well , older VHS tapes of Mystery Science Theater 3000 . Hope you guys benifitted from this review !

Most of the time this player is out of stock , but totally worth waiting for a month or two to get this little daredevil I have never owned a media player with that many features , and the best thing is that all works just fine . This is what I have used and tested so far : As a media player is great , it gets movies , pics and music from : 1 . any uPnP servers such TVersity , or the buld-in from Windows 7 2 . Shared folders from the PC . 3 . USB or SD cards . 4 . External HD -LRB- my Toshiba canvio did not worked , I am not sure if it is due to the micca USB not being able to give the necessary power or the fact that the HD is in FAT32 format -RRB- 5 . Internal HD -LRB- I used a 2TB Samsung Eco NTFS -RRB- You can copy files from those sources to any target using the GUI or you may use the internal HD as a NAS and transfer using Windows on a PC , it transfer data to a 5mb\/s but that is pretty much expected for a 100 mbits\/second connection , I would wish this to be a 1Gbit\/s but it is not , so transferring HD movies or Blu-ray isos would take forever , in that case I use the USB cable directly to the PC and I get 35mb\/s . The subtitles works great also , it gets them from the video file itself -LRB- if any -RRB- or external . srt . sub etc. . . off course they need to be located on the same folder as the video and have the same name . You can chose between multiple audio tracks the file might have , multiple languages or different formats , 2ch 5.1 ch 7.1 ch you name it , and get the output from the HDMI or optical TOSLINK . Everything thrown to this machine it has played , even blu-ray isos without cuts , Micca engineers obviously know what they are doing , and doing it well . They have released a firmware update that fixed all the little bugs I found so far , that 's why I am giving 5 starts to this and not 4 . The 3.5 bay made me go with this product and not the ep-250 or any other player on the market , now I carry just one small box with hundreds of music , movies or series . The box itself is not pretty but not ugly , the materials seem strong enough , it has an old look which may mach with other devices , the only complain I have is that when the devise is in stand by mode -LRB- red light -RRB- and there is a power outage the devise will turn-on by itself , I contacted Micca support about this and they contacted me in a timely and professional matter but they told me this is just the way it works , the workaround is to use the manual switch at the back of the unit . Overall , great product , great R&D and support , great customer service . 	Media Player
I 've had this for about a year , and use if infrequently in a vacation cabin setting . After not using it for about 8 months , I can not for the life of me figure out how to get it working again . I did email the seller , and while they tried to be helpful , the end result is that they can not send me a pdf of the instructions -LRB- which I lost -RRB- and finished our conversation with ` I 'm just the retailer ' . I was trying to get specifics on the wire attachments . So , for me , this is now a brick . but it work well when it worked . 	Media Player
If I have to choose between one evil corporation in Microsoft or apple for my mp3 player needs , I choose Microsoft . I mean the zune is just cooler than thed Ipod , and while apples I tunes store is the number one , it honestly is the only thing keeping the I pod alive other than the phone , I tunes is a useless program that is confusing as it is annoying . Zune 's operating Program is Way better and it 's mp3 player can connect with the ps3 and x-box 360 and allow you to import music and export video and such , So Buy a zune , it 's so worth it .

well now 9 months later ... and this thing crapped out ... HMDI does not work ... wrote to NBox to no avail ... was willing to either have them fix it or exchange for credit to purchase another updated player ... go no response ... so I guess customer service is to busy to response to my request ... will never again purchase anything from this company ... it seems to me . . they got there money ... so who cares about there old customers ...

Wow , the very fact that Amazon automatically shows a wifi dongle bundled with this unit should warn you ... There 's no built in wifi ! As someone who has several gaming systems , a roku box and an iPad , all that can view netflix\/internet radio wirelessly , I 'm blown away that this product requires an extra purchase to do the same . This is a dedicated media player and really , they could n't have added $ 10 onto the price and built it in ? So you 're either going to run Cat5 from your router to the WMP75 or you 're instantly spending more money . I realize that wireless dongles are n't particularly expensive these days , but in current day of wireless surfing that really is unacceptable . If you want netflix then just buy the Roku box . It 's cheaper -LRB- and works brilliantly -RRB- and has wifi built in . 	Media Player
First things first do n't mix it up with its almost identical twin brother the Britelink bluetooth audio reciever -LRB- cause I made that mistake and cybertech was at the top of their game wanting to help me fix the problem I had Thank you guy 's ! -RRB- So do you 're research and be sure this is what you need if you do n't understand something and to avoid trouble later on down the line ask the seller ! Let me say this is an incredible item for me because I would use my wired headphones almost all day everyday and they would wear out in an average 6 month 's . I just got tired of sending them back to the company for repair when I heard that there were a pair of wireless headphones I had to go for it but they only lasted for two hours disappointed as I was I searched else where and bought my backbeat 903 + bluetooth headphones -LRB- wireless -RRB- for my Playstation Portable 1000 version but little did I know that , that system was n't bluetooth compatable -LRB- none the less I kept it for my PS3 -RRB- I took to the net for help and found people were talking of whats called a dongle . Now what a Dongle does is it makes something that is n't `` bluetooth happy '' and turns it compatable with a bluetooth headphones\/headset you could say it builds a `` bridge '' linking the two items . Now for the rest its not easy to explain but sometimes I will get what is called `` dead-air '' now its only brief more like it stops and starts fades in and out because ... `` they ca n't talk to each other '' what I mean is I wear my Playstation Portable on a strap -LRB- heavy duty so it wo n't break -RRB- around my neck for hands free deal now when I walk it swings left to right never staying in the same spot unless I hold it and I have the transmitter velcrowed to the Playstation Portable so it wo n't swing as well , now when the system swings around my neck it does n't align with the headphones and thats how I get the `` dead-air '' -LRB- basicly if their not straight it wo n't be as great -RRB- but its not a whole lot I can just push the mute button on my headset or re `` pair '' the two and its fine . I am content with this verses the 6 month alternative . you can also plug it into tv 's , speaker 's , computer any thing that is not bluetooth ready you must have bluetooth headphones\/headset though . Its got about 10 meters range meaning you can hook it to your tv and lay in bed while you 're wife\/husband is asleep and not bother them -LRB- soundwise -RRB- however I recommend you only use it as a music deal cause with a tv I heard you may get whats called `` lag '' where the words do n't match up with what the actor 's are saying . Says 10 hours but I get 7 hours of a charge and I 'm good for that . Now you should n't just toss you 're wired headphones keep them in the event the battery dies on you or something such as extended traveling or all day shopping , etc -LRB- invest in a multi-port car charger -RRB- its got the clever 3.5 mm jack -LRB- meaning the plug for where the headphones would go -RRB- . Even though it says you do n't have to re-pair it to the bluetooth device I sometimes have to and to just avoid frustration I do it anyway . Has a `` bass boost '' feature so thats great . I think I covered everything . All in all great price -LRB- at time I bought it -RRB- awesome device I like it ca n't live without it ! 	Media Player
The software is absolutely the worst on the unit as well as the computer . Wait for at least the third generation for this . Back it goes within half a day of its purchase . Save your time and money . Microsoft really screwed up on this one . It 's unreal how badly it functions . 	Media Player
This digital media player fulfilled all of my expectations for the first two weeks . That was as long as it lasted . After working flawlessly , the unit refused to recognize any USB drive attached to it . When I contacted the manufacturer they offered to replace it if I sent the unit back WITH A 20.00 MONEY ORDER . Essentially -LRB- since one can assume the original price was significantly marked up -RRB- I would be buying a new unit . No thanks . Save yourself the hassle and purchase another product !

I recently bought this player hoping mostly to use it to watch Netflix on my Tv . I wo n't go through the setup process as many reviewers have allready covered that , but I will warn any international buyers to contact Sony before buying this player . In my case , living in Latin America , I do n't get to use Netflix or Hulu or many other services . I can use Netflix on my computer , Apple Tv , smartphone and xbox360 in my country , so it is not a Netflix problem . Ironically , Netflix works just fine with a Sony Playstation 3 here too . With the SMP N200 though it 's simply not an option . I contacted Sony support about it and the basically said they were `` sorry '' but no Netflix is available for your contry . When I asked if they were working on it , the support rep just said , `` if it ever becomes available it will be posted on our web site '' . Not the best customer service from Sony . The one star is because , as of my purchase , there was no way I could tell this would happen , and because the product simply does n't come close to providing what I wanted . If you 're a US buyer , I recommend reading the other reviews . 	Media Player
I purchased the Boxee Box mainly to watch downloaded video . I 'd hoped to use it as a single device to handle all of my media needs , but unfortunately when I purchased the Box , the streaming video did n't work very well for some reason . I had to rebuffer every few seconds , making online video next to useless despite my fast internet connection . The latest update has solved this problem . Here 's what I like about Boxee Box : - Netflix now streams in HD and handles varying connection speeds well - Handles basically any video type I throw at it - Large app library - Show directory includes services each show or movie is hosted through Boxee is n't perfect , and there are a few things I wish it did : - Automatically add show information for downloaded files - Hulu Plus support -LRB- which Hulu is supposedly working on -RRB- - Better internet browser and Flash video handling -LRB- if there are Flash ads on a page , bringing a Flash video to full screen sometimes causes weird clipping issues -RRB- However , I 'm still giving it 5 stars because it 's something I use every day and it 's obvious the Boxee team is putting a lot of effort into their product . I expect it to continue improving and updating , and since it does everything I want it to do , I 'll rate it high . 	Media Player
True plug-n-play , setup up took less than a minute . Movie files do not have to be right under root folder of external drives , user-friendly interface . I have n't tried the other capabilities of it yet like wi-fi but standby for that , so I 'm giving it 4 stars for now but could easily be a 5 star soon as I try out all the features . Shipping was very quick , it only took a week to receive while I 'm on deployment . The great thing is batteries are included . 	Media Player
I have one of every device to stream Internet content to my television , but nothing works as well as the Boxee Box . Not only does it play any item on my computer , but it also has a working browser . I highly recommend the boxee Box ! 	Media Player
I was looking for supporting all media file formats ... and it works great ... the customer feedback from the seller is excellent ... i strongly recommend this product and waiting for their upcoming v4 version of the product to buy another unit . 	Media Player
Overall the product works great and plays just about every format from a hard drive . Despite difficultly in setting up the wireless network , I love this product . The instruction manual is not very good but the user support , which was very helpful and first rate . I could not see my wireless network and found out through user support that you have to hit the `` zoom '' button which resets the available networks . Once it was connected , I could play movies from my computer with no problem at all or from a external hard drive . Nice sharp definition for both HD and non-HD movies and very fast connection speed . The KDLinks wifi connection to my computer is first rate . I do not use it for external sites such as You Tube or Netflix so I can not comment on that . . 	Media Player
"I was excited on Christmas Day to open my new Boxee Box and set it up . I was replacing an old 1st Generation Apple TV and was looking forward to using the Boxee Box to access both my local files and the loads of Internet content available . Sadly , I had n't noticed the line under Technical Details on the product page that indicates that the box will NOT play DRM video files . Suddenly , I was using a box that would not stream any of the TV Shows or Movies that I have on my computer . I was also limited to free internet content due to the lack of Netflix , Hulu , Vudu , etc. . I was suddenly faced with the prospect of not being able to purchase downloadable media -LRB- iTunes , Amazon Unbox , etc. -RRB- and then stream them to my TV . All of these purchasable items have DRM . So , really , the only local files supported by the Boxee Box are those one creates oneself . Since I do n't create a lot of videos , I did n't have a lot of use for the local file support on the Boxee Box . The hardware by D-Link is probably the best quality I 've ever seen from D-Link . The software from Boxee is a bit elementary . I wish they had kept their old interface instead of trimming it down with the latest update . The device itself works well and was easy to set up . I would highly recommend it to someone looking for a device primarily being used to access Internet content -LRB- once the Netflix , Hulu , and Vudu apps are added -RRB- . However , Boxee 's support staff was awful . It took 3 days for my support ticket to be assigned to someone . I submitted a ticket and received an automatic e-mail letting me know that I would be notified when it was assigned . For 3 days I sat waiting . I sent e-mails asking for some sort of contact -LRB- there is no phone number to call for support -RRB- . My first contact from Boxee came as a reply to a Tweet where I lamented the days-long silence from their support staff . I received an apology and my ticket was finally assigned to someone . If a public complaint to the Twitterverse is required to get a support ticket handled , I wish good luck to anyone with Boxee problems . The idea of the Boxee Box is great ! The hardware and software appear stable . I know that eventually Netflix and Hulu will be supported but I ca n't justify paying $ 200 for a device that wo n't stream the TV Show and Movie library that I already possess . Ultimately , I returned the Boxee Box in favor of a 2nd Gen <ahref=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001FA1NK0/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/181-5558675-1273122""> Apple TV MC572LL\/A -LRB- 2010 -RRB- </a> . I lose some Internet content but gain back the ability to stream the media I paid for . I think the only solution currently available to stream purchased -LRB- DRMed -RRB- media AND Internet content is a computer connected to the TV . "	Media Player

First thing you do when you get your hands on this baby is to Upgrade the Firmware . Win 7 doc support is horrible & if you took sometime like me to configure @ home network then you need to quickly create user a\/c in Win 7 & use the a\/c to gain access to network-shared folder on your Win 7 pc shared folder\/drive . & ya . . do n't bother about Wifi\/n channel thing if you can hook this up with cat5 cable to your network . I do n't think you will be a looser without wifi . . might as well same some $ $ $ It does what is says El Perfecto ! Browser with flash support & USB keyboard\/DVD drive support are the lacking aspect that i can think off . . Is it too much to ask for from Linux firmware Image ? Update : The customer support is vanila horrible ! Support guy answering usually do not have a clue & comes out with Off the air answers which do not answer your question . Besides streaming of web content is still not possible which is unacceptable since the product has done over a year in the market with no such firmware updates to make it work 	Media Player
My title says it all . This player really does very good job playing all the video files I have in my hard disk and flash drives . Instruction -LRB- in plain English -RRB- and setup was pretty straight forward enough that even I could do it . I had slight hiccup initially when the player failed to recognize my TV but that was easily remedied by turning off and off the main power switch and the player recognized my TV . The main advantage of this player is the price and the fact that it can handle so many kinds of video codecs . It does not have wi-fi or Ethernet to do video streaming from internet . From reading other reviews , I also like the fact that if you have an issue with the unit the company will respond quickly if you contact them . It is comforting to know that you will get decent service if you ever have a problem with your player . With all the cost cutting , companies tend to cut corner on customer services but here it appears that is not the case based on other reviewer 's comment . 	Media Player
Had it for a year . Works unstable . Often looses network connection . When it does , often happens that it floods the router with looping requests , so your whole home network suffers , sometimes to extent of totally loosing connections , and you have to reset everything . User interface is so-so . Not the worse I 've seen , but not the best either . Most importantly , I do n't see a value in this device anymore . I think I made uneducated decision when buying it . My main need was to stream media from home network , which I could , after installing various media servers on different computers , which differ between PC and Mac . Now I bought a LG blue-ray player , which not only has the blue-ray capability , but also has all of the functions of the WD media player , including streaming from home network devices -LRB- btw , without starting any special servers on my computers , just sharing a folder with your media is enough for LG to see it -RRB- , more supported media formats -LRB- I can now see some files I could n't with WD -RRB- , and access to premium services from internet , things like Netwflix , Pandora , Vudu and all . User interface of LG is also more intuitive . Btw at the time of writing WD still do n't have access to Amazon streaming , which LG player does , but I guess they may add it with a firmware update . So given all that , and taking into account that LG player is also cheaper -LRB- got it for $ 119 from Amazon , while this WD is now $ 179 -RRB- I do n't see any sense in buying this device . Just look at the blu ray players currently on the market , even older ones -LRB- my LG is from 2011 -RRB- are now offering more features for less money . Still giving it two starts , as it did somewhat serve me for a year . 	Media Player
Before I decided which MP3 player to get , I made a list of features I wanted . Namely , I wanted : 1 -RRB- Good size 2 -RRB- Durability 3 -RRB- The ability to use a regular file system transfer to add music to it . I did n't want to have to use some special software -LRB- like Windows Media Player , iTunes , Creative Explorer , whatever -RRB- just to put my music on it . 4 -RRB- Good battery life 5 -RRB- Highest-quality sound 6 -RRB- Support for OGG and other file formats When I first started looking for a player , I thought I would have to give up a couple of these wishes . I continued to think this until I discovered the X5 . It met every one of my wishes , and it has a great user interface . Wish # 3 above was probably the biggest . I think it 's just plain ridiculous that any player would require some sort of special software to put playable music on a player when it already detects as writeable hard drive . To each their own , I guess . On the X5 , all one has to do it drag a file , folder , or entire directory structure onto the player . Then , when the player is disconnected from the computer and turned on , it looks through the new songs and they 're ready to go . My own battery life test showed about 10 hours of use . This was with the volume set at 40 -- the highest volume , far more than enough to cause hearing damage . I 'll probably try it again at a reasonable volume -- 15 or 16 . There are only two downsides . First , the included headphones are horrible . Do n't bother . Second , the screen protectors that come with it are pretty bad . They 're quite difficult to apply without getting a bunch of bubbles . I still have n't managed to do that . I just took a Palm screen protector and cut it down to size . Overall , this player deserves serious consideration . I have found it to be better than any other I reviewed , and is the one I ended up getting . 	Media Player
I asked for this unit to replace my Linksys DMA2100 media center extender . Watching the live TV on the linksys unit was something I never did but I got tired of not being able to watch any movies on my home network that were n't in the AVI -LRB- Divx -RRB- format . I also had to use my Wii to watch netflix , and I wanted everything in one unit . This unit plays every media format I 've thrown at it -LRB- MKV , Mp4 , AVI , WMA , etc -RRB- , and it not only does netflix , but also Hulu Plus after the software updates ! Setting it up was dead simple , I had a USB wireless N dongle that I knew from the WD website was compatible , I plugged it in to the USB port , turned on the unit , entered my SSID and passphrase , and it connected , then it prompted me to update the firmware . It had to update THREE times , but once done it connected fine and everything just worked ! I definitely recommend ! 	Media Player
I purchased this product for a specific reason . I have a large collection of Old Time Radio Shows in the MP3 format on disks . I wanted to play them throughout my house by downloading them onto either flash drives or SD Memory Cards . The Memory Cards work the best without any trouble . The flash drives are not always read correctly so I have stopped using them . The firmware could be updated to better read flash drives . It could also be updated to follow what is playing on the screen . At present , when you start with a particular program or song , the screen stays on that program and does not change to the next , when it moves to the next program or song . This could be improved with an update . It is easy to move the unit throughout the house . I am using the HDMI connection in the kitchen and another connection on a FM Transmitter in the bedroom so I can listen to the shows through out the house on radios set to the FM frequency .

I purchased this unit in part due to the excellent reviews on Amazon . I should have checked the ASUS Forum first . Windows 7 users have all kinds of trouble with shared drives and files . I finally got it working with Windows 7 by doing a Registry Edit provided on the ASUS forum . Not quite plug and go , right ? The documentation states it plays most all file formats , however it will not play many of my WMV high quality files -LRB- these play fine on a PC and windows media center so it is not the file -RRB- ASUS Support on this device is non existent ... check the forum and there are cries for help everywhere . User Interface has a long was to go as well . . functional but not great . Perhaps with future firmware updates it will improve over time , but for now be advised . 	Media Player
"I recieved the WD TV live plus unit today . <ahref=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003MVZ60I/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/179-1188834-3024035""> Western Digital WD TV Live Plus HD Media Player WDBABX0000NBK-NESN </a> It was an easy install until I updated the firmware . On the 3rd firmware install after restart , the unit shut off and would not power back on . When I talked to WD support , they informed me that the device had a hardware failure and to return the unit . Thanks to the quick return policy of Amazon , it speeding back thru the mail an hour later . "	Media Player

I can not give a product review for the Microsoft Zune because about 4 days after I ordered the product , the vendor canceled the order . I called the number listed in the email and they offered to send it to me for $ 199.00 instead of the $ 99.00 original posted price . I declined . 	Media Player
The box comes with a stupid , simplistic , incomplete piece of paper with pictures telling you how to connect it . It does n't cover lots of configurations , and there 's no paper manual . The digital manual must have taken about 5 minutes to write , and is useless . There are NO BUTTONS ON THE DEVICE . That 's right , you ca n't even turn it on\/off without the remote . The firmware it comes with is garbage . The sound\/video options are confusing and have no help info , and I 've been doing a\/v crap for decades . As soon as I tried to change to high def , the display broke and never came back . I got the new firmware through the cheesy update utility , which did n't help a thing . I even went to the site and spent several hours downloading adn installing a homebrew firmware that the forum recommended . It would boot up about one in 10 . After about 5 hours of screwing with it , and getting it to work about 10 % of the time , I sent that garbage back . What a disgusting pos . 	Media Player
I 've been using this media player for about a month or so and it has worked out great . Plays every format I throw at it . I purchased this on Amazon by the way , great deal . A BIG REQUEST to WD : Please add a feature that gives me the option to DELETE movie files after viewing . The only thing I wish is better is the boot up time , takes a bit , but other than that , it works like it supposed to . This is a great unit , I am very happy with it and if WD adds the feature to delete movie files , I 'd be even more happy . 	Media Player
I was looking for a device that recognized hard drives greater than 2TB . When I hooked up my 3TB drive , it was instantly recognized it . Easy to operate , no problems yet . For the price , I 'm really pleased with the perfomrance . 	Media Player
This media player is \* amazing \* for so cheap . My parents spend a lot time in their RV and do n't often have cable , so I sent this up to them with a ton of TV shows and Movies to watch . Pros : - Cheap - Plays xvid video , which is the only format I tried - Good quality video output , even with standard RCA cables - Cheap - Easy enough to setup - Cheap Cons : - None , really . A few interface tweaks would make the device better , but seriously , for what this thing costs ? I could n't imagine too many improvements without increasing the cost dramatically -LRB- e.g. HDMI -RRB- . 	Media Player
I bought this thing from Amazon - brand new . Arrived within 3 days and as soon as I try to use it - problem starts . First of all you can not record anything from TV , cable or satellite box . Do not believe what you read in manual , it does not work . It does have nice display and plays most of the known video formats as soon as you copy files from your computer into gadget . My item works for almost 5 days and then just died on my hands from unknown reason . It just died . I could not turn it on anymore . All attempt to communicate with the tech support of COWON -LRB- JETAUDIO -RRB- turn out complete waste of time . All what they did waited until my time to return item will be out but lucky me I bought it with Amazon . Little push from Amazon and I got return merch authorization . I do not know yet if they going to charge me re-stocking fee but I already lost double shipping fee . First to get item and second to send it back . If it did not work brand new what will it do as used\/refurbished ???? 	Media Player

The software for this Zune took me literally a week to install , after several calls to both the Dune technical support and Dell technical support . On the positive side , the Dune technical support was helpful and I was n't placed on hold for 20 minutes . I still have to figure how to put videos on it . S.S. 	Media Player
Packing a 3 '' screen , an FM-tuner , and Wireless features into a unit almost exactly the size of a video iPod , Zune is a compelling alternative to Apple 's iconic iPod . While it 's hard to match the elegance and innovation of iPod , Microsoft has broken new ground with its `` community '' features of Zune - which allow wireless sharing of songs from one Zune to any nearby Zune . The shared songs are limited to 3-plays-in-3-days . With its aggressive pricing , and feature-packed opening model , Microsoft may just turn the portable media player world into a two-horse race .

So I 'm doing tons of research on MP3 players and portable media players because I 'm moving to Japan in a few weeks and I thought it would be easier to just put all of my music onto an MP3 player . Through all of the research I kept coming back to the iAudio X5 . I have had it now for about one week and I love it . I 've already put over a thousand songs and three videos on it . Very easy to use and the sound is incredible . Far better than my friends Ipod . Plus , if you are an audiophile and you happen to use FLAC codec then this is one of only two players that will support it . For the price , this little machine can not be beat . 	Media Player
Truly an amazing product . It has played every video format I 've thrown at it without a single hitch . I do n't have any problems with network connectivity being dropped , and I 'm using an ethernet over power adapter . The only issue I have is the responsiveness of the UI , it 's not bad but it could be better . All in all , if you need a device that does one thing -LRB- play HD video -RRB- and does it very well , this is it . 	Media Player
Easy to use , the older software works well . Great battery life and great video viewing . Highly recommend over the IPOD . 	Media Player
It 's working great for me , I 'll answer a few questions many people wanted to know and are always asking in forums -LRB- I was one of them -RRB- DOES IT PLAY ISO FILES ? It plays ISO files , most of my movies are ISO and they all play great . It does n't have problems playing other formats as well . WHAT ABOUT THUMBNAILS FOR MOVIES ? I 'm using 332x500 -LRB- jpeg images -RRB- and it looks perfect . Make sure you name your movie and jpg image the same . WHAT ABOUT DUPLICATE THUMBNAILS ? I was having this problem and I fixed it by deleting the folder '' . wd_tv '' from the hard drive . Just connect the hard drive to you computer and it will be there . I do this every time I connect the hard drive to my computer to transfer new movies . Once the hard drive is connected back to WD TV LIVE the folder will be created again with the new information and without duplicating thumbnails . SOUND NOT IN SYNC WITH VIDEO ? This happens to me when I fast forward -LRB- maybe in 2 or 3 movies I have -RRB- ... I found a solution by rewinding a few seconds back -LRB- 3 - 5 secs -RRB- then hitting play again , if it does n't get in sync completely rewind a bit more . It worked for me , I know sometimes every case is different but maybe this might help some people . Overall , I 'm happy with it , it 's very convenient to have my entire library available with the touch of a button . : -RRB- 	Media Player
The Boxee Box has to be the most incredible waste of technological opportunity ... ever . This device had promised so much and it seems could do it , but the company itself apparently has no sway in the marketplace to bring the media that consumers want onto it 's device . It seems it worked so hard for about half a year to get Netflix and has pretty much stopped there . In the Boxee User forums there is a bit of advice that i see over and over again , `` I personally could care less if either one of these makes it onto the Boxee , as there are countless other ways to acquire them through already owned hardware '' . The point of purchasing the boxee was to forgo the purchase of countless other devices . I think the normal blu-ray player off the shelf can offer more usable programming -LRB- for the normal american family -RRB- than the sky 's the limit open source boxee box . I do n't care to watch every techno review site on boxee , just netflix and amazon movies for my children and movies off our personal hard drive . that 's it . Also the boxee locks up pretty regularly and my wife and kids do n't know how to restart as it does n't have a normal power button , so if I 'm gone , it 's off to the Blu-ray for Netflix . All in All , I defintely do not recommend this device . It has tons of potential , but it 's held back by the ineptness of it 's creators to bargain with major players . 	Media Player
Let me first say that I do not own this product nor do I own an iPod at this time . I have another MP3 player which I use with one of the subscription music services out there . However , I am considering either the Zune or the iPod to replace that player . To be fair , I have also had the opportunity to play with the iPods before as friends of mine have them . What has gotten to me here is the almost silliness of some of the comments about the Zune . And though I am not huge fan of Microsoft I feel the need to defend them here a little . This is not due to any bias against Apple or Microsoft , but because some of the agruments are just insane . The following applies to the 30gb capacity for both brands . First the physical size : The iPod measures 4.1 '' x 2.4 '' x 0.4 '' . The Zune measures 4.4 '' x 2.4 '' x 0.6 '' Maybe it 's me , but it does n't seem the Zune is that much bigger . Especially with the WiFi , FM radio and larger screen . How about the weight ? iPod : 4.8 oz Zune : 5.0 oz Is the weight of a few sheets of paper really that much of a difference ? Again I point to the additional features . The style of the device is really up to each person 's preference . We hear about the sturdiness of the devices and get all sorts of conflicting reports . I have held both and they both feel pretty sturdy , though I do understand where people talk about fingerprints and scratches with the iPod . The music service alone -LRB- forget the video and podcasts -RRB- to me is a difference . I like the idea of a $ 15 unlimited plan . I have a varied taste and am constantly trying new music so it makes sense for me . As for video and podcasts - yes . I do want to see those as future offerings . I also admit to liking the idea of the FM radio . The WiFi does n't really matter at this stage as there are n't enough Zune users out there yet . Big negatives to the WiFi are the addition of DRM to unlicensed files , the inability to access files through a wireless interface and the inability to send or receive video files . Hopefully those will be addressed in the future . The software issues I can not speak on first hand as I have not installed either iTunes or Zune Marketplace with one of the devices . I have heard horror stories on both pieces of software however . Right now it 's the Zune software more than not mainly because it 's a new product and also because of some of the animosity toward Microsoft . Overall , the two products are about the same size and weights . They have the same storage capacity and both seem to have comparable sound quality . The screen size though is dramatically different and the Zune does offer a bit of personalization which the iPod does not . Yes , it would be nice to have easy import of files purchased from other music store , but the burn to CD and rip them down option is there for the moment . In basic features the Zune does have the advantages of the WiFi , bigger screen and the FM radio tuner . I 'm inclined to give the Zune a shot . Yes , it 's a first generation unit and I 'm sure there are bugs with it . If I decide to purchase either the iPod or the Zune I will be happy to give a fair commentary on that product . Hope this helps many of you . 	Media Player
This player is unable to recognize both of my 640GB USB HDD when I connect them directly to the player . The logo in front of the player just blink which indicates that it is reading the disks and that is it . It does not even say `` compiling media library '' which indicates that it recognizes the disks . These disks are recognized by my older WD HD TV player . When I contact WD , the agent asks me to reformat these disks with FAT32 . When I told him that this is not possible , there is dead silence on their end despite me asking repeatedly for updates . I would not recommend his player to anyone who has a big disk full of media files . Not being able to recognize a big disk full of media file defeats the purpose of having a media player in the first place . 	Media Player
The people at NBOX were very sincere and took long strides to make sure I was happy with the product . I highly reccommend this distributer . The media player , once installed is easy and fun to use . This media media player compares well to to any other in this class and and is much less costly . . A GOOD BUY 	Media Player
Weighing in here , I think I can add a little bit more to discussion of this product : PROS : \* supports unicode character song titles and folder names -LRB- this means if your song title is written in Chinese , it 'll display in Chinese on the player 's screen ; because I have a unicode library this was very important to me -RRB- \* supports multiple file types , meaning you are not locked into converting all your songs to a proprietary format -LRB- my library is a huge mixture of file types and iAudio plays them all -- so awesome -RRB- \* the X5L is small -- much smaller than I 'd thought \* my whole CD collection fit onto the 30GB storage with room to spare -- another reason I liked this unit \* bright , big LCD screen \* it 's not an iPod and not made by Apple \* volume can be easily adjusted without looking at the device \* music libraries can be dragged and dropped into the player and they are ready to play -LRB- very important feature for somebody who already has their music library organized in the way they want it in the player -RRB- NEGS : \* the joystick navigation is not intuitive . Once you navigate up or down to your song of choice , you 're going to hit `` Right '' on the joystick , right ? No , you press `` Down . '' Now you 're ready to go back so you 're going to hit `` Left '' right ? No , you press `` Down . '' Baffling and stupid \* no `` stop '' button -- want to stop the music ? You ca n't . You have to turn off the unit \* in order to charge or connect the unit to your computer , an add-on component is required \* the ear-buds do n't stay in your ears and the cord is a different length on each ear \* protective case or belt holder not included with unit In general I 'm actually very happy with this unit . Like the other reviewers , I was waiting for the just the right type of mp3 player to come out before I bought something . This comes pretty close . I can carry my entire CD collection in my hand which is what I was shooting for , and the unit supports unicode titles and folders . Likewise , I was able to drag and drop and already-organized music library into the unit and it worked perfectly . So , this is a product with good merit . What would make this unit a superior product is : a carry-case with a belt clip included with the unit or available somewhere on the market . -LRB- I have yet to find a good one . -RRB- And the power\/USB connectors should be right on the unit rather than on a special attachment . Also the navigation system should be intuitive ; I do n't mind the joystick if the system works , but its current programming is clunky and awkward . I feel very bitter sweet about this purchase . It does what its supposed to do , with all the right features . I 'm glad I own it . But Cowon would do well to listen to these issues and correct them next time around . 	Media Player
All I can say is WOW ! And what a great price . This device replaced my Logitech Revue that I used for Netflix and my Acer Revo 3600 HTPC that I used XBMC for streaming local content . This device does both and better . I have the WDTV Live , Logitech Revue , Acer Revo 3600 , and Roku and this is the better all around device . I still have high hopes for the Revue when it gets the Honeycomb update but for now this is the device to get . I think I might buy another . 	Media Player
I mainly got a Zune because I did n't want to pay for an iPod . Why ? Personally , I ca n't stand iTunes . I am no giant fan of Apple either . Nor am I a fan of that senor wheel . Zune remedies all of this . Some things it does n't do that great though ... Pros : The Zune software feels exactly like Windows Media Player 11 , all of the controls on the device are buttons , the large display helps for movie watching . The price is right too , since last I checked 8G iPods are running the same price as a 30G Zune . Finally , the wireless connectivity of the Zune works out great . The Social network is definitely an interesting feature that everyone with a Zune should at least try . It can also play podcasts . Cons : I did n't do it because I did n't feel I would need it , but since the price drop I would suggest the extra $ 50 for the extra 50G . It really is a great deal . The battery life is about 15-20 hours at half volume , not great but good . Also , from time to time the software can be a tad buggy when adding new songs . I recommend this product for every music listener . Cheaper than an iPod video , and all the same features . 	Media Player
I ordered two different NBoxes . Both of them rolled on the TV screen . When it was working , it was great . But it quit working . Will not buy again . 	Media Player
If you have never used an I-Pod you will love this media player . I like the size because you can hang on to it . I uploaded all of my mp3s and have not filled up half the memory . The battery lasts for a long time . I go 2 or 3 days between charges . Cons : The only complaint I have is there are very few accessories available for it and the ones that are out there are very expensive . Maybe the prces will come down as more people buy this player . 	Media Player
Mac users beware ... you will have to use a media server . You can not stream directly from your Mac . I have been using TVMobili and when it works it is awesome . This box will play just about any video file . Unfortunately I constantly have problems and I 'm tire of resetting it . Netflix works great . This box is much better than Apple TV which I also own and is a piece of crap . I 'm going to send the WD TV Live back to Amazon . I 'm tired of it not connecting to my media server , it locks , and is very buggy . This little box has tremendous potential and is amazing when it works . Picture quality is great . The UI is pretty solid too . It could be improved but I found it fairly easy to use and it looks pretty good . Give it a try if you 're savvy with media servers . Perhaps you will have greater success . 	Media Player
Out of the box the unit was easy to set up . I had videos from my WD Passport drive playing right away . I did have to change the WDTV Live Plus aspect ratio from wide to normal to accommodate my 4x3 TV . I do not use the unit on a network so I can not comment on that . Soon I discovered that DVD menus were not recognized with the supplied firmware . I easily updated the firmware to version 1.04.10 via internet by connecting the unit to my router . With the new firmware I watched a Netflix streaming video without a glitch using only an aircard for internet access . Good news . With the 1.04.10 firmware version the DVD menus worked . Also good news . However , the unit now cropped the video from the hard drive . With wide-screen video only a bit of the sides was lost . With full-screen video bits of the top and bottom were lost as well . I confirmed this by playing the same videos on my computer . With the older firmware I could zoom out and thus see the entire video frame . The new 1.04.10 firmware eliminated this option . I have rolled back the firmware to the older version . At the moment it seems I must choose between DVD menu functionality and viewing the full frame . If WD improves firmware to include both of these , I will give the WDTV Live Plus 5 stars .

Pros : amazingly small , easy to set up , easy to start up and easy to carry around and the price is really good -LRB- about $ 100 bucks -RRB- Cons : The sound volume from the speaker is too small . It should have some kind of headphone input to connect to either headphone or some sort of speaker . I saw one video from youtube teaching you how to make a headjack yourself . I might try it someday . If they have it already , I will jump from 3 stars to 5 stars . : -RRB- 	Media Player
The Microsoft Zune is being attacked by loyal iPod \/ Apple customers on here , who should have just stuck with their iPod . The Microsoft Zune is fantastic . The screen is awesome , the sound is far superior to the sound on an iPod -LRB- and is n't that what it 's all about anyway -RRB- ? It 's still new , and Microsoft will improve with future ZUNE units . I 'm sure they are working on units like the Nano , etc. . I definitely give the Zune 5 stars , and would recommend it to anyone - unconditionally . I think it 's funny how everyone who likes to complain about it says the same things -LRB- it sounds like they all got together and are trying to really ruin ZUNE -RRB- . If you are trying to decide , I have both an iPod and Zune , and use the Zune ALL the time now - much more than the iPod . 	Media Player
I gave this to my husband for his birthday and he loves it . You can store pictures on it too , so he can look at me and the kids while he is on his break at work . You can watch movies on it , and music videos and listen to music . It has such a nice size screen too . Sounds great . 	Media Player

I have an AppleTV , XBOX 360 and this product . If I had to buy one for someone else , I would get this product again . This is a much easier user face than most media players I have seen .

I love headphones that retract because they 're so easy to get in and out of my bag , and I no longer have to deal with messy , tangled cords . On top of that , these Pyle in-earbuds are very comfortable -LRB- Apple-style earbuds hurt my ears , but these are soft and fit snugly -RRB- and the sound quality is better than many I 've tried . The one down side is that , as others have mentioned , they 're not very durable . I bought a pair in May 2010 and by January 2011 one side quit working . After searching for a month -LRB- in town and online -RRB- for another set of retractable , in-ear headphones , I 've come back to these . This time , I 'm ordering TWO , so when\/if one breaks , I 'll have a backup ! -LRB- At this price , why not ? -RRB- 	Media Player
I really like the Zune . I was a little hesitant to purchase it based on some of the consumer responses . I 'm glad that I did n't let my reluctance keep me from purchasing it . I really love it . This software is very user friendly and easy to use . The sound and picture quality is totally amazing . As far as the others response about it not being up to the standards of Ipod ... ... ... ... that 's total BS . It 's fantastic , and even better yet , it 's not an Ipod . 	Media Player

Bought this after looking at various options . This won on price and ability to play everything . Has not let down in case of playback and plays everything that I threw at it . Network streaming is great and plays even blue ray without any hitches . Youtube is where it stumbled . WD really needs to fix youtube usability . Unit keeps rebooting if I try to log in to my account which is frustrating . I would try something else next time though . 	Media Player

I 've only had this for a few days , but I am loving it . I must say I ordered this from Amazon the day before Black Friday for $ 89. , and if it had n't been so cheap , I would n't have bought it . I have a 1GB Creative Zen Nano that I also love . The unit is very substanial . It has a solid feel . The picture is great , as is the sound . I love that they just upgraded the software to allow wireless synching . I wish it came with an AC adapter . I listen to a lot of podcasts from NPR : Wait , Wait , Car Talk , Story of the Day , as well as music . I used to have to be careful to erase the podcasts so I would n't run out of room . There 's no worry about that now . One thing that puzzles me is why so many mp3 players , this one included , come with magnetic headphones that stick together . Yea , it looks cool , but it does n't really have any function . and magnets and magnetic media do n't mix . 	Media Player

It looks exactly as seen in the picture , works greats , does what it 's supposed to do . hav n't had any problems with it . Only thing i would like to have had is a holding case for it .

There 's nothing wrong with this great product -- it was pure and simple stupidity and operator error .

I loved this phone , it was so convenient . It worked great with my ATT SIM card . The MP3 quality on the stereo headset was outstanding .

The company would not even reply to any warranty questions , and acted exceptionally illiterate and dumb . I had bought this CECT phone via sourcinggate . 	Memory Card
It 's a pleasure to buy a product that performs exactly as advertised . It is a functionally beautiful design , both rugged and attractive .

As a DSLR owner , when my college age daughter let it be known that she 'd like a new camera for Christmas , I started shopping . The camera had to be portable -LRB- she carries it in her purse -RRB- yet capable of taking good pictures as well recording as high quality video -LRB- she 's majoring in journalism and sometimes has to do her own photography -RRB- . The F505 seems to fit the bill . While I have n't looked any RAW files , its JPEGS look good out of the camera . Add to that the CMOS sensor , the 15x optical zoom , and the usual array of high tech bells and whistles camera manufacturers seem compelled to put on products these days -LRB- do we really need separate settings for dog and cat pictures ? -RRB- , and you end up with a camera that does fine flying on autopilot but also offers the flexibility of manual control . Highly recommended for the point and shoot crowd , and a good second camera for a DSLR owner looking for something shirt pocket size . 	Memory Card
Super blazing fast cards . I use them for a GoPro camera and the read write speed is faster than the one they list on their site . It 's great for burst -LRB- 10 pics . in 1 second -RRB- other cards can not handle the demand . Great addition for anybody with this type of camera or have a high res . camera to handle that once in a life time shot . 	Memory Card
I have ordered this 2 weeks ago and somehow their system keeps losing my order . Waiting for a reply to te email , will update later to see if they fix this mistake . I hope so ... 	Memory Card
Worked perfectly , easy to set up with windows home edition . Takes great color video and sound . Just as good as a $ 100 dollar entry level video camera for $ 23 delivered to your door . 	Memory Card
I ordered the product it was the product I expected and it arrived in two days although I selected standard shipping . It was indeed a new SD memory card as advertised on the website . 	Memory Card
I 'm an unusual and especially demanding camera user , but not because I 'm an expert in photography . I take thousands of photographs a day to record historical documents for my job as a professional historian . Otherwise I 'm a typical camera user with a typical knowledge about how digital cameras work - the exact kind of person who would be purchasing a high-quality point-and-shoot camera like this one . It 's difficult to avoid superlatives when describing this camera . I really am very impressed with its quality and features . The good : 1 . This camera produces the best-quality photographs of any small -LRB- ish -RRB- point-and-shoot camera I have ever used . It 's almost impossible to take a bad photograph . 2 . I believe the reason the photos are so good -LRB- per my comment above -RRB- is that the auto mode , called EXR on the Fujifilm , is simply amazing . It 's way better at doing its job than comparable auto features on other digital cameras . You do n't have to be an expert at photography because the camera does all the technical work for you . It makes all the right adjustments in macro , aperture , white light , shutter speed , etc. . If the room is dim , the photos are bright -LRB- as they would appear to the human eye -RRB- . If the scene is bright , the camera adjusts accordingly to prevent washout . When the subject is lit by incandescent or , worse , fluorescent lights , the camera adjusts the white light filter to prevent those ugly yellowish or washed-out photos that you probably get with your current camera . These are things that all cameras are SUPPOSED to do , but very few compact cameras do it as well as this one . 3 . The LCD screen is huge , extremely sharp , and unusually bright . 4 . The shutter and auto-focus is very fast for a compact camera - almost instant , in fact . None of that waiting around while your camera focuses and finally snaps the shot . This is a handy feature if you have pets or kids or regularly take action shots . 5 . The zoom is fantastic . It 's extremely rare to get a 15x zoom in a camera this small . My old semi-SLR is three times the size and only has 12x . The zoom also works pretty fast . You do n't have to wait forever for the camera to zoom , focus , and take the shot . It can literally go from wide-angle to 15x and be focused for a shot in about 2-3 seconds . 6 . Even better , the same lens that gives you 15x for those long-range shots also does amazing wide-angle shots -LRB- 24mm -RRB- . This feature comes in handy when you want to make pictures of your house or garden look more spacious than they really are . It also helps for those big group shots when the whole family gathers together for the holidays . 7 . The battery life is very good . I can shoot for about 4 or 5 hours continuously without a charge and get over 1,000 photos in that time when I 'm working on historical documents . I imagine you could take pictures periodically all day on one charge . 8 . The batteries are cheap , lightweight , and readily available . The replacement Fujifilm brand runs about $ 12 plus shipping . A well-rated aftermarket replacement here on Amazon can be purchased for less than $ 4.00 including shipping ! -LRB- ... -RRB- . For the price of a burrito you can have three spare batteries plus the original to keep you going for days of continuous shooting . -LRB- EDIT : I ca n't include a link to these batteries , but you can find them by searching for the NP-50 battery here on Amazon . You can also find out more about compatible accessories -LRB- chargers , AC adapters , etc. -RRB- on the Fujifilm website . -RRB- 9 . The options in the menu help you know what exactly you 're changing . You might even learn something new from this thoughtful feature , like I did ! 10 . The camera is relatively lightweight and pretty small for the features you get . It easily fits in the front or back pocket of my jeans . Basically this camera gives you the features of a semi-SLR but fits in your pocket with ease . 11 . The camera has a handy feature for reviewing your photos - and RETURNING TO READY MODE . To review your photos you simply push the little green display button like on any camera . Ordinary stuff . But have you ever had that problem where the dial was turned to `` review '' and you could n't get it back to ready mode in time for a great action shot ? Yes , we all have . Well , with this camera , you simply give the capture-image button a light tap and you 're back in action . It 's way faster and way easier than any other digital camera I 've used . 12 . The video quality is really high and you can adjust it to different sizes and speeds if you need more space for a long day of shooting . 13 . It 's pretty ergonomic . It 's big enough to fit in your hand but not so big that it 's heavy or awkward . One hand picture-taking is pretty easy with this camera . There 's also a little rubberized indention on the right side where your fingers can grip . 14 . It has an effective built-in flash that goes down when the camera is off but rises when you turn it on . The automatic flash sensor seems to work pretty well too . It flashes when you need it and stays off when you do n't : none of those annoying flashes at the wrong time . 15 . The special features are better than on most compact digital cameras . -LRB- a -RRB- First there 's a feature specially designed for low-light conditions . The camera actually takes multiple photos and then laces them together to get the best light and contrast . Photos in a dimly lit room , or , say , around a campfire , look as good on this camera as they do to the naked eye . This is a big improvement from every other digital camera I 've owned , which have tended to take really dark , blurry photos whenever the light is low , even when I have manually adjusted the aperture and light settings to where they ought to be . -LRB- b -RRB- Then there is a portrait enhancer that smoothes the image and makes a face look better . -LRB- c -RRB- There is a feature for taking close-up shots of , say , flowers , where the camera takes multiple photos , sharpens the main object -LRB- the flower -RRB- , and blurs the background . It 's a very nice effect and something that normally can be done only with SLRs . -LRB- d -RRB- Finally there is a feature that takes a burst of four shots and then lets you either choose the best or keep all four . This is nice for action shots and for portraits of a big group of people who might blink or make faces . The bad : 1 . The flash is positioned bad . It rises on the top left of the camera where most people would habitually place the left forefinger . Once you get used to it , the problem does n't seem so bad , but it 'll probably be one of the first things you notice . 2 . The printed user 's manual is useful but not very detailed . It just gives the basics . To learn more , especially about what certain camera terms mean , you 'll have to use the software that comes with it . That may not be a problem for you , but I personally would prefer to have a printed copy in my hand right out of the box . 3 . The battery takes quite a while to charge - about two hours . This is OK , I guess , since the battery lasts so long once you get a charge , but it 's a little frustrating if you find your battery drained and need it for instant action . That 's why you should buy spares , I guess . Despite the three reservations listed above , I 'm very impressed with this camera and recommend it highly . It 's the perfect way to get near-SLR quality photos in a small package that is both cheaper and easier to use . It 's made my job of photographing documents much , much easier and much , much faster . And it has made my everyday photos of family and pets and scenery and sites so much better than I ever thought possible in a camera of this size . Five stars for a home run by Fujifilm ! 	Memory Card
I originally used this in my phone , but switched to using it in one of my digital cameras . I 've had no issues and it 's been a real champ . It 's awesome that they can make these so small and yet have so much capacity for storage . Just be careful with it . It 's so small that you could easily brake it in two if you use too much force . I use it with a standard SD card converter . When it was in my phone it was used without the converter . 	Memory Card
it just works , grate price , sandisk is a brand i can trust in flash memory i got two of these put one in my camera and one in my digital pitcher frame , very happy . 	Memory Card
Super fast delivery even before estimate time loveee it : -RRB- i will definitely order some more ! because they are some cheap and works great ! plus it even comes with a SD card adopter for my SLR camera ! sweet deal ... 	Memory Card
Although I have not gotten to use this much , it appears that it is just what I needed for my new Canon T3i . Delivery of the item was , however , less than what I 've grown accustomed to with Amazon ... it was 2 days late , and was unable to be tracked -LRB- stuck `` in transit '' -RRB- for several days . Other than that , I look forward to plenty of video space on this card . 	Memory Card
Received this SanDisk 8 GB flash memory card and am using it in my new digital camera and it works very well . Do not have any problems with this product . Great Value . 	Memory Card
Received the chip must faster than estimated delivery date , so that was nice . Expected it to include a mobile reader and not the adapter , but instead got the adapter . Not sure what the mobile reader is -LRB- SanDisk microSDHC 8GB card ships with Bonus MobileMateTM Micro Reader -RRB- . My computer read the chip with no problem . Might contact the seller to find out about the mobile reader . Update : contacted the seller via email and received the mobile reader in the mail -LRB- along with a 2nd adapter -RRB- . quick response and responsiveness . 	Memory Card
I ordered two of these memory cards to go in my Nikon D7000 . They work as advertised , storing a ton of pictures with speed . I got these because I felt they were the perfect balance of performance and price . I wanted something a bit speedier than standard class 10 memory cards , but I did n't want to spend a fortune . They work flawlessly , although some macbook pro 's do not recognize them . My friend 's 2011 MBP was n't able to read them , so I had to get a usb card reader to plug in , but they work perfectly in my 2010 MBP . I 'm not sure why . They are massive , at least for shooting pictures , and each stores around 6.4 thousand pictures for a 16.2 MP camera at JPEG normal , but since they 're so big I took the opportunity to shoot in RAW\/NEF where the camera says they store around 900 pictures , but I found I was able to put around 1400 on the card , even with a few videos . Not sure why , but it 's cool . The fit and finish is excellent , not that it really matters , but I definitely trust the SanDisk name with my once-in-a-lifetime shots . The amazon frustration free packaging was great , and I would recommend it if it 's cheaper which it sometimes is . If you 're going on a big trip and are wondering how much memory you 'll need , I bought to of these to go to Europe for a month . I ended up only filling one , but I copied my images to the other and kept it in a different spot in case my camera got stolen . You can also get memory cards abroad in case of an emergency , but you know , nothing is going to be as hilariously cheap like it is on Amazon . I went to Best Buy a few days after I bought these , and they were ` on sale ' there for $ 99 , when I got them on here for $ 33 , go figure . 	Memory Card
This probuct does what is intented to do . It scans photos fast and the scanned photos are of high quality . No issues so far . 	Memory Card
I have the CF card version of this Pelican case and I have loved it so I bought one for my SD cards . But what 's pictured in the pictures is not what you get . I guess they have redesigned their memory card cases . What you get is this . -LRB- ... -RRB- It does n't feel as rugged . It actually feels a little cheaper . The insert is now this foam material instead of the really nice rubber they have in my CF card case . Like I said , it feels a little cheaper . 	Memory Card
Below was my experience with this product : I purchase the two of these from Woot . I gave one as a gift and kept one . The one I kept for myself was defective . 3\/21 , 3:20 pm PDT : Tried to call Pandigital customer service 3 times -LRB- 800-715-5354 number as well as local # -RRB- so I can exchange , but no answer by tech support . 3\/21 , 3:30 pm PDT : Sent email using web site . Reply was to give them a call . I told them I 've been calling but they do n't answer , which is why I sent an email . I got no reply . 3\/22 , 12:10 PDT : Tried calling twice . Ring . Music . Ring .

To my surprise , Woot , without questions asked , is sending me a replacement ! Now that 's customer service ! Thank you Woot ! Thank you Amazon ! 	Memory Card
This baby performs fast and I have not had a corrupted picture yet , I highly recommend this to anyone looking for a spacious card !!! 	Memory Card
I 've got other larger and smaller memory cards from Transcend , Kingston and others . Aside from one Kingston 32gb that corrupted on me during a shoot ... I have almost never had any issues with my card 's performance . I ordered the 4gb so that I was n't shooting over the size of a dvd which is what I give my clients . Now I 'm not a techie . I do shoot with a dSLR . Nothing uber difficult . Lighting is adequate & I 'm not shooting NASCAR ! But simply put , I had to wait for this particular card to write on several occassions . During a baby shower ... cake was already cut before I could hit my shutter ; during a joint forces award ceremony ... the Unit Commander had already coined and kissed the cheek of the service member 's baby before I could hit the shutter ; during a retirement ... the funniest Hallelujah dance came and went before the card was ready for another shot . I mean , get real . It 's embarrassing to be out shot by a mobile phone . And I purchased two of these suckers from Amazon because I thought I was getting such a good deal . It has n't been . I 'll keep these in my wireless all in one printer . 	Memory Card

As with many reviewers , when I buy something from Amazon I am really hoping to like it . I have now tried several cameras in the compact superzoom lines including the Panasonic DMC-ZS9 -LRB- the stereo version of the ZS8 -RRB- and the Canon Hx230HS . I have been looking for a camera to supplement my Canon T1i SLR when I just do n't want to pack around the larger frame . I would consider myself an amateur photographer . I understand the use of aperture sizes , etc. . The good about the camera is that for 4x6 or maybe 5x7 print sizes you will probably be pretty happy with this camera . However , once you zoom to full size of the photos in `` large '' size they picture becomes rather grainy . Zoom in on an eye with my SLR and you see an eye , zoom in on an eye with these cameras and you lose almost any detail rather quickly . This is important to me as I like to do some touch-ups and eyes are kind of important when it comes to people . I also noticed that pictures of my daughter , unless she was completely still , would look out of focus . I am not sure if this was a problem with this camera or if it simply does not have a very fast auto focus . Unfortunately , I am usually using the portable camera in less than optimal lighting so jumping up to a faster shutter speed is not always ideal . As for the `` EXR '' system it is not overly clear even after reading the manual on just how it works . I know that when I was taking pictures inside my house at only about 6-10 ' from the subject it was bumping up the ISO to 800-1600 and I was not shooting in that low of light . The pictures turned out okay but once again you would see the blurring . I almost thing the EXR simply blurred the photos a bit to reduce the noise that is naturally created at high level ISO settings . As for ease of use , I liked that there was a video mode button -LRB- by the way video was middle of the road - again lacked an ability to adjust to focal changes with any level of speed meaning focus to blurry back to focused -RRB- and the tilted control wheel was okay . I did not like that the flash pops up every time you turn the camera on it is in an area where I normally place my finger . Had I kept the camera I might have gotten over this . What I really did not like was the menu system . Setting up the ability to take continuous shots or performing bracketing takes too many steps and seems cumbersome . They have a special mode for low light shooting which is great to have but you first have to go to the special modes wheel selection , scroll through roughly 20 modes , and then select the option . Now you are ready to shoot . Unless you want to try the professional low light which requires that you go to the advanced setting on the wheel , then scroll through to professional low light and you are then ready for high dynamic range shooting . This is supposed to be a point and shoot camera . Even setting up continuous shooting requires -LRB- for some reason I could not tell you -RRB- that you set the number of frames per second and then the maximum burst size . Why not just have a continuous shooting selection on the wheel -LRB- many manufacturers do -RRB- and you hold the button at it takes pictures at your currently selected size at whatever frame rate that may be ? In the end , when I am out with my friends and just want to get some fun group shots or pictures of my family , I do n't want to spend a bunch of time fiddling with menus . Fujifilm seems to believe that people like menu options and moving through them . Some of the photos came out pretty good but some barely looked better than what I might get from a smartphone cell camera . Finally , as compared to other cameras of this size it seemed rather heavy . If you are not used to SLR maybe this is a great camera . But from what I am seeing , cameras at this price point with their small sensor sizes -LRB- regardless of MP resolution -RRB- just do not put out fine details under any level of examination . So , I will keep looking . 	Memory Card
What a great design approach and great product - when it works . I 've found that lines appear in the scans after random amounts of use ; sometimes 20 scans , sometimes many more . After cleaning and re-alignment all normally works well again . When this thing works , you ca n't beat it . Good quality scans done very fast . Just a shame that issues crop up that require maintenance too frequently . 	Memory Card

Whoever says this camera produces fantastic quality pictures is lying because the photos come out looking so horrible . I fiddled with the different settings and even took some shots manually and they were terrible . The only positive about this camera is its slim compact design other than that its junk . My old panasonic tz5 took better pictures than this camera . 	Memory Card

I purchased this microSD memory card , which is sold by BlueProton . I saw that they had overwhelmingly positive reviews . It was cheap . I thought , sounds great . But the memory card they sent me was a dud . I was in email contact with them about the dud from the first day I received it but I was unable to send it back -LRB- due to my own follies -RRB- until 2 weeks later . At this time , the `` RMA '' number they gave me had expired , which is needed for a return . When I asked for a new one they refused . They then refused to send me a replacement memory card . I 've sent them three emails since then to the representative who 'd been helping me . All were ignored . I do not recommend buying from BlueProton . Buy your Sandisk Memory Cards from someone else . 	Memory Card
Worked perfectly with my pro duo memory card adapter for the psp . It did n't recognize the 8GB card at first but after the format it works entirely and files transfer very quickly . I 've had no problems with the card and I am still using it to transfer music and other files to my psp . 	Memory Card
Just purchased this card for my new Canon T2i . After considering a few different cards of this size and class , I decided to with the ol' reliable SanDisk . Initial impressions are positive . The card claims 45MB\/s , which I decided to test . Using 233 of 26MB RAW images -LRB- about 6GB -RRB- , I did read\/write tests using both FAT32 and NTFS . Read speed on both was good , about 40MB\/s average on both file systems . Write speeds were a bit slower , 30MB\/s using FAT32 and 25MB\/s using NTFS . So what does this mean in the real world ? Using my Canon T2i , I was able to shoot 6 shots in RAW mode , before the card would become busy . After that , I could get a shot about every 1-1 .5 seconds . It is really up to the individual user to decide whether or not that is acceptable , but for me it 's okay . I was able to shoot using the largest JPEG setting continuously , without the card becoming busy . I gave up after 51 shots . Overall , my opinion on this card is very positive , especially as a casual shooter . 	Memory Card
this SD card is a excelent choice for HDSLR entusiasts and video pros , the speed of recording in full hd is amazing . 	Memory Card
Product received before anticipated . I got 16 gb instead of 8 gb . It is Class 4 , but the data rate is slow . I do n't know whether it is because of my system . I copied same files to my GS2 's internal storage . The transfer rate was faster . However , when I copied to the micro sd , it was slow . It showed the transfer rate as 3.78 MB\/s though . I do n't think the adapter I received is original . The micro sd seems to be original . Thanks a million to the seller for the bonus . 	Memory Card

Like the title says , there is n't that much to say about it - I mean , it 's a memory card ; it does its job ! I am satisfied , but I do n't really notice any difference between this `` HD '' card , rather than the normal type of memory cards , other than a substantial price deviation . I 'm not sure if I would recommend it over other memory cards , but I am happy with it . 	Memory Card
"While you do not really need this fast of a card for photos , -LRB- though it is nice -RRB- it really shines for shooting video with my <ahref=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005Z3DWCU/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/189-4637073-5634153""> Canon EOS Rebel T2i 18 MP CMOS APS-C Sensor DIGIC 4 Imaging Digital SLR Camera with EF-S 18-55mm f\/3 .5 -5.6 IS Lens + Canon EF 75-300mm f\/4 -5.6 III Telephoto Zoom Lens </a> . No need to worry about any dropped frames . And the transfer rate of both video and still is just flat out incredible with this card . With the price of these cards dropping to about $ 20 for a 16GB , for me it was well worth it . I could n't be happier with this purchase and would highly recommend it to anyone with a DSLR and\/or anyone who needs a fast transfer SDHC card . As always SanDisk is a premium brand when it comes to SD cards , and I always feel confident I am buying quality when I purchase one . "	Memory Card
This case is a very handy idea if you have multiple SD Cards . I was using the individual cases that the SD Card usually comes with so there was a level of protection . However , if you use these cards on a consistant basis and have multiple cards it 's easy to forget where you left them . This case holds 8 SD Cards and is a great way to protect and keep track of your cards . 	Memory Card
Bought this card -LRB- 16gb size -RRB- for use with my Panasonic HC-V700 hd camcorder . So far it has worked very , very well and I have recorded about a total combined ~ 20 hours of video . I record at the highest possible setting on the camcorder -- 1920x1080\/60p -LRB- `` full HD '' -RRB- , file format AVCHD . There have been no hiccups with this card and everything is very smooth . At the highest video settings in my camcorder this 16gb card can hold almost an hour and a half of video . For my purposes -LRB- filming short clips of newborn -RRB- it works well , but if you wanted to video tape longer things -LRB- say , a sporting event -RRB- you might want to consider getting the 32gb . This is a great SDHC card . It is a little more expensive that other class 10s , but I have had `` class 10 '' cards hiccup on full HD video so it is worth the money to me . 	Memory Card

I have not experienced a single error or manufacturing deficiency with the SanDisc name brand memory . I use them in phones for music player , data and photo storage .

This allowed me to corral all my cards in one place and I 'm very thankful for that .

SanDisk is a brand name I can rely on . I purchased this for my camera because I can count on true color reproduction when I download to my computer for printing . 	Memory Card
Having previously owned a SanDisk `` Ultra '' I knew that the extreme would probably be a nice one as well . I love the extra space and the speed . It 's quite fast , allowing me to take a long exposure and record it to the card in less than half the time of the shutter speed . For example , with my old card , if I took a thirty second exposure , it would take another thirty seconds to process the photo . Now it is all written in ten seconds . A couple weeks of use , and so far I am very satisfied ! Nice work , SanDisk ! 	Memory Card
I consider flash memory pretty generic . So I bought the best priced chip and it works fine . Not to mention I use it in a car stereo flash drive in a Jeep with no top . So it takes a little more abuse than standard and holds up . 	Memory Card
It works great in my Samsung Captivate and includes an adapter so I could use it in my Cannon camera should I find that its SD card is full . 	Memory Card
We have a Canon 60D and we have been using this SDHC card for a year now without any problems with speed regarding taking high-speed multiple photos or making 1080p movies on our Canon 60D . We have not lost a photo yet . I wound up purchasing a second one a few months ago . I have a long history of success with the SanDisk Extreme products -LRB- prior to the Canon 60D , all the SLRs we had used CF Cards and I have repeatedly purchased them from SanDisk Extreme line -RRB- . Update -- 5\/15\/2012 -- I just purchased 2 more ... 4 total -LRB- Amazon had a big discount today on it -RRB- 	Memory Card
This is the ideal SD card for my DSLR . Excellent for continuously shoot , as well as lengthy HD recording . Excellent speed and storage capacity . I 'm glad I did n't go for a lesser known brand for a cheaper price . Spend an extra few dollars and get something you can rely on ! 	Memory Card
This was my second purchase of this great Pelican SD memory card case . And , I will be buying more of them ! These cases are the perfect way to store your important memory cards . Probably like a lot of people , I had many SD cards just sitting around all over the place . They contain years of photographs & scans of important documents . With all of the flooding , earthquakes , & tornados that have been happening here in Arkansas this year , I decided that it was finally time that I get these cards organized . And these cards really helped me with that ! Since I am a scuba diver , I know the quality of the Pelican brand . Almost every dive boat that I have ever been on uses the large yellow Pelican cases to store equipment and a first aid kit . And many divers use Pelican cases to store their underwater cameras & equipment . So , I highly recommend the great quality Pelican brand SD memory card case ! 	Memory Card
The video I get out of my kodak playsport on this card is pretty awesome . It records in 1080p so I needed a high speed card . I hear nothing but great things about sandisk sdhc and I see why . great little card for HD cameras . 	Memory Card
Easy to install and easy to use . Plug it in , install the self extracting software and insert a picture . No muss no fuss . 	Memory Card

This product is working flawlessly in my Dell Axim X51V . The price and delivery were great too !!! 	Memory Card
Needed SDHC cards for a new camera . After several reviews of different cards I settled on SanDisk Extreme . I have used Extreme III CF cards for a different DSLR camera . I have used other brands but prefer SanDisk . 	Memory Card
I had no idea how really tiny these little `` micro '' SD cards are . I bought two of them for a pair of Blackberry Curve 's that my partner and I use . The addition of 8GB adds tremendous capability to our devices and was worth every penny . The MicroSD card reader is equally as tiny . Do n't be fooled by the pictures , these are two very small items . The reader comes with a leash which makes it easy to retrieve . The reader and card seem fragile to me -LRB- but I suppose any memory card of this tiny size would -RRB- but they work like a charm . Installation on our Blackberry Curve 's went without a hitch and usage of the MicroSD Reader has gone well too . For the money , you ca n't beat it . Sandisk is a great brand name , that 's one of the main reasons I chose this card over others . The final decision came though when I saw that it included the reader as well . I would highly recommend this memory card if you have a device that supports it . Marvelous ! 	Memory Card
Everything seems to work fine , the only SDHC device I have is my N82 and they work great together . N95 8GB eat your heart out ! 	Memory Card
We have a Nikon D90 this chip adds room for 2,400 hi res photos in our camera , Great for wedding photographers . 	Memory Card

The memory card , was a perfect fit . My At & t Tilt recognizes all of the available memory . 	Memory Card
I love this little scanner for the one reason I ordered it - to scan lots of old photos for upload to facebook . Scanning is very fast - a few seconds for each photo . The quality is good for viewing but not as good as my less expensive , flatbed scanner . However , the first 100 photos I scanned , which took about 30 minutes to scan , would probably have been a day 's work using my flatbed scanner . I listened to another reviewer and have not used the plastic sleeve with no problems . Every so often , it will pull a photo in at an angle ; I just load it through again . Overall , this was a great purchase ! \* Because there were no examples of the photo quality of this scanner , I have uploaded a few of my results . 	Memory Card
I have scanned over 2,000 photos dated back to the 1920 's without the `` protected '' cover and it has been wonderful . There is no new damage to the photos and I have continued scanning over a couple of weeks with the machine working fine . I would recommend getting memory cards so that you can store all of the photos on them without loading up and shrinking the memory on a computer . 	Memory Card
No problems . Works with all my devices . I have had this item for almost a year now with no problems to speak of 	Memory Card
I have a Lumix DMC-FH24K 16mp point and shoot camera that also does a good job taking videos . I wanted to be sure I got a flash card that could write fast enough for smooth vidoes . a -RRB- Fast enough to take smooth videos with my camera b -RRB- Fast enough to take burst mode pictures . -LRB- camera spec 'd 1.2 s per picture continuous -RRB- . Typical 16mp picture file size is about 6MB . This card is fast enough to get the job done . Maybe it is faster than needed , but I did n't want to get cheap and buy a card that could n't keep up with this camera . Paid extra for the higher speed and it works well . . See benchmark data in customer photo section . Benchmark result summary : File sizes 16MB to 1MB Read speed is about 19MB\/sec , Write speed is about 16MB\/sec .

It 's not perfect . But , if you 're willing to work around all it 's issues , it 's a -LRB- very , very ... very rough -RRB- gem . It gets : 4 stars for `` feel '' , 4 starts for `` value '' , 4 stars for `` features '' , 3 stars for `` handling '' , and 2 or 3 stars for `` image quality '' , depending on which of the many modes you 're using . The F505 EXR is solidly built and feels nice in the hand - it 's quick to start , shot-to-shot -LRB- even RAW -RRB- is excellent , overall when shooting it leaves you with a favorable impression . The amount of control it allows the user and the plethora of options available buried in the menu system sets this camera apart ; if you can do it with a digital camera , it 's probably in there somewhere . The downside to that is the complexity of the interface - there 's some learnin ' to be done if you want to be effective with this camera . Battery life has been acceptable ; about 300 shots . In full-auto mode it does a good job in daylight conditions . If the camera sticks to ISO 100 , there 's plenty of detail for quite aggressive cropping ; the photos print well , showing good detail with a little saturation adjustment and sharpening . However , as is common these days , ISO ramps up far too rapidly ; ISO 200 already starts to show some minor noise-reduction artifacts , but by ISO 800 JPEGs are plastic-y , showing a lot of blotchy chroma noise despite overly-aggressive noise reduction that blurs out too much of the detail . The images will still handle moderate cropping -LRB- around 50 % -RRB- and are printable at 5X7 ; saturation needs to be punched up , though . ISO 1600 ca n't be printed bigger than 4X6 without noticeable artifacts . Image stabilization is moderately effective ; I 'd estimate about 2 stops advantage - but with an F5 .3 lens at 360mm equivalent it 's just not enough , especially in low-light conditions . 16X zoom is for daylight conditions only , unless you actually like that `` smeared , unrecognizable chaos '' look ... Movie mode is quite decent ; again in low-light and at longer focal lengths the camera struggles ; there 's a lot of trembling due to the IS working overtime . One issue not mentioned in the formal reviews is the sound the IS system makes - audible throughout the recordings as soft clicking noises . Then there 's the dreaded corners . It 's best to avert your eyes , they get ugly . 24mm wide is worst , but it remains a problem throughout the zoom range - as others have noted , it seems worst in the left upper and right lower corners for some reason . In the center , pixel-level image quality is good ; it 's definitely not a camera for pixel peepers , though . The EXR modes actually DO work , when used appropriately . The DR -LRB- `` dynamic range '' -RRB- mode adds 1-2 stops , but does nothing good for fine detail ; it 's a tradeoff - better shadow and highlight rendition but 8 rather than 16 MP of detail . I 've been using the SN -LRB- `` signal-to-noise '' -RRB- EXR mode quite a bit indoors ; again , at the expense of detail it reduces noise , making ISO 800 more tolerable\/useable ; you gain about 1 stop . RAW mode eliminates the noise-reduction artifacts , but then you begin to see why noise reduction is necessary ; vignetting is severe at 24mm but improves rapidly . What RAW does give you is more dynamic range -LRB- about 2 stops on-screen -RRB- and significantly more detail . The problem is finding a RAW developer ... Some say FujiFilm Inc. is slipping a bit ; there 's a lot of dross about quality problems , poor customer service so forth on the interweb forums . The software supplied with this camera - old\/primitive\/clunky stuff ; 1990 's programming , really - is not helping that perception . The fact that the in-the-box Silkypix RAW software version CAN NOT OPEN THE F505 's RAW FILES -LRB- Wha ?? really ?? -RRB- - kinda cements that impression into place . The updated Silkypix converter compatible with the F505 is available here : -LRB- ... -RRB- - it clearly gives you an advantage in detail . Google 's Picasa does develop the RAW files , but really does n't do them justice - you lose wuite a bit of the dynamic range advantage . FastStone also develops the RAW files , but the results are identical to the JPEGs from the camera ; not useful . Of note , Adobe ACR does n't recognize the F505 RAW files , I have no idea why they 're different from the F550 's RAW files . There 's a lot more to say about this camera , but I do n't think anyone wants a 5-page review . I 'll sum up by saying I picked up the Fuji F505 EXR more out of curiosity ; it was cheap and it ticked all my important boxes - manual controls , RAW capability , 24mm equivalent wide with a useful long zoom , mechanical image stabilization and a low-light mode that looked quite promising . I ca n't cart my dSLRs around all the time and I just want some pics of the kids , so they 're overkill . As is true of all compact super-zoom cameras , the F505 EXR is a mixed bag - I am willing to put up with a bit of noise and corner softness when I 'm out and about with my family . Image quality is n't fantastic , but it 's quite acceptable -LRB- under certain conditions -RRB- ; as a pocket camera it 's versatility gives it an edge . 	Memory Card
Dark Secret was a great book from a great author . All the characters in this book are actually real and I love the fact that the main heroine and hero had to learn to accept their faults and differences and that what they wanted was n't always what they were going to get and that in itself is real love loving someone with faults and all . Unlike Feehans prevous novels where the Carpathian males `` conforted '' their lifemates , the major premise the author conveys throughout the entire book is that Carpathian males are not human , that they have are a different race with a different set of moral societal standards therefore it is impossible to judge them by human standards because they are not human . In this novel the Carpathia males portrayed were very dark , very dangerous , and very scandalous . Feehan exhibits more closely the torture carpathian males suffer were they are close to converting to vampire . She does a great job conveying their desperate anguish and dilemma and you actually for this first time see why finding a lifemate is so important to the male speicies of the Carpathian race . Although there some reviews on this book who felt that the hero was a `` rapist '' I strongly disagree with that assumption . At no time did the hero ever actually force the heroine into forceful sexual relations he does however betray the heroine with a choice that almost shatters the complete trust of his lifemate , which causes him almost to lose her love and faith in him however the hero wins the trust of his lifemate by understanding her cultural differences and appreciating her choices and most importantly bending his domineering ways so that there can find a middle ground a necessary trait in a male and female relationship . In conclusion , Dark Secret revealed the secret of Carpathian history not really discussed in the other prevous books and we actually go somewhere with the mysterous woman who the vampires are trying to find . In addition the author communicates to the reader that no male is perfect even a Carpathian male , yet with understanding and patience you will encounter the greatest gift of all : A powerful love .

The Sennheiser PC155 Traditional Binaural PC Headset has been an excellent purchase . I use these headphones for making Skype calls , listening to music , noise control on airplanes during travel , and for making software training videos . In every aspect , these headphones perform . The optional usb hookup works great in both desktops and laptops . The sound is clear and crisp , as is the recording when speaking into the mike . My only issue with these , is the volume control . It does n't allow you to take the volume too high . This is probably done on purpose for safety concerns . But I think a few extra decibels would have sufficed . Otherwise , these are an all around great performing headset and well worth the money compared to other less expensive headsets found at the electronics stores . 	Microphone
Item as described , very happy with performance . There definitely is a big change for the better in the noise reduction component , easy to use and worth the price . 	Microphone
The mic is nice and works just fine for a short time , the only upside is that when it dies every 4\/5 months , its only $ 5 to replace . 	Microphone
Works very well very happy with it no complaints . Would recommend it to anybody for that home vehicle or shelter 	Microphone
I prefer these to ear buds that cost four times as much -- in fact , I 've bought three pair . They 're neither metallically shrill nor artificially bass-pumped . What I love about them is the fat , full middle register , which is never muddy . Lots of air in the sound , which makes them good for rock and classical . 	Microphone
I bought this mic to communicate in team games I play online . The mic itself is great , clear , easy to use , no complaints about it at all . The only reason for losing a star is the terrible mounting clip it 's attached to . It will not stay on my headphone wire by itself , had to rig it with a wire twist . Other than that , very good product . 	Microphone
the sound is perfect ! i love the long cord ! it just a little big when you wear them on your neck ! 	Microphone
I go through headphones at a pretty fast pace since I play Worlds of Warcraft quite a bit . These headphones are sturdy , have a nice long cord , an inline volume adjustment and comfortable ear-pads . They were cheaper than anything Walmart had but actually seem better constructed than ones I 'd purchased at Wally World before . I think I got the best buy for the money . 	Microphone
"I would strongly suggest avoiding these SkullCandy over-the-ear headphones . First , they sound terrible . Listening to a favorite piece of music , suddenly I 'd open my eyes and say `` Where is it ? '' There would be pieces of music simply missing . They sound muddy and bass-heavy , and just plain awful . . especially when you have to wonder what pieces of the music you are n't hearing at all . To top the experience off , they broke ! -LRB- No great loss !! -RRB- Flimsy construction of earpiece holders . One just snapped -LRB- and it was under no significant pressure . -RRB- SkullCandy in general is now on my Do Not Buy list , as I consider them a rip-off . I replaced these crummy $ 58 -LRB- approx -RRB- set with a $ 20 -LRB- approx -RRB- pair of Sennheisers <ahref=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003LPTAYI/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/178-0777492-5783627""> Sennheiser HD 202 II Professional Headphones -LRB- Black -RRB- </a> and all my music is back . They 're \* much \* cleaner , more accurate , more comfortable , and from past experience with Sennheiser they will be rugged and long-lasting . I ca n't imagine quite whom the target audience is . Perhaps those who have never heard even a reasonable set of headphones ? Hope this review helps someone else avoid a similar disappointment ! "	Microphone
I was pretty excited when I bought these when my Ipod earphones stopped working . If my 8 dollar Coby earphones were n't so good , maybe I would be less critical of these . As a musician trying to figure out songs , I ca n't really distinguish instruments and there is no bass . The only reason I 'm keeping these is to use as a headset for calls . The over the ear design seems to be flawed as well because it does n't really fit snugly . I would try other earphones 	Microphone
Very happy all the way around , item was in my possession in a couple days . The microphone works great . No complaints here . 	Microphone
I purchased the Azden WMS-PRO system because I am an independent film maker and videographer , so a wireless audio system would be perfect for the webisode I just started filming . The first day filming all I can say is thank god I had a back up audio on the second host with a sony wireless lapel system that was even good enough to pick up the first host clearly . I purchased this set as an inexpensive alternative and an added convenience . I was using the AZDEN system wirelessly from host number 1 , into an H4N audio recorder where I was monitoring audio with my headset . We are filming a reality based show where our camera men follow around 2 hosts , so as soon as she started to walk and I was more than 5-6ft away from her static would come across very bad . The batteries were brand new and I received the item earlier that day and did not have a chance to test it , also assuming it was brand new and it should work fine for what was needed . It would only work if I was close enough to her just out of the frame which in essence was totally useless . Even when I was that close I had to move the antenna around to get a clear signal . I am not sure if it was just a defective piece or if they are all like that , all I know is the one I purchased was crap and if it was n't for the other lapel and the boom mic , I would have had to do a whole other shoot and wasted every ones time . I returned the item for a refund and I purchased the Audio Technica PRO 88W for around the same price to see how if it will work for what I need , if not I will just have to bite the bullet and spend the $ 400 for another UHF system from Sony .

Do not purchase this microphone unless you want a hassle installing it . As yet , I have not been able to get it to install with Windows XP including Service Pack II .

Just got this webcam , and i have to say i 'm very pleased with it ... the video quality is a lot better than i expected and setup was as easy as plugging it in . Only minor thing is my friend says i sounded weird when i talk ... whatever that means . I 'm guessing it 's the built in mic , not my speaking voice he 's referring to ... 	Microphone
I really liked it as the voice quality is great and even the sound output is fantastic . The only drawback is that you ca n't use it for long time as it becomes uncomfortable . It can adjusted in proper position in your ears and can be used for long period . 	Microphone
I recieved my i-talk just in time for my rehersals in a new show . I need it to record m vocal parts . It worked just I expected and there really were no problems except for the slight delay when you first start recoeding . But I just ended up pressing pause for something if it went back and forth . I did appriciate that it just set things up as seperated recordings unlike having to rewind or fast forward a regular old tape . I would definately recommend it . 	Microphone
Sure you get what you pay for but this exceeded my expectations . Instructions were simple , software was self explanatory , almost plug and play . Was wireless with mobile connect in about ten minutes . Very pleased . 	Microphone
I purchased this as a gift for my grand daughter . She uses it all the time when talking to her friends and she loves it . It has with stood the use of a 14 year old and being transported to different locations for her use . It was worth every bit I spent and more making her happy . 	Microphone
I use this Headset mainly for Gaming . The Sound quality is extremely good . While using the Headset , it blocks out all sounds around your environment . Once you get used to them they are very comfortable , but at first it will bug your ears . The cord is lengthy enough to move around and doesnt get in the way , and also has a Volume control that is easy access on the actual cord . I wanted an expensive Headset , and my mom wanted me to buy a cheap one , we settled for the in between price after reading other peoples reviews and looking at the design . I am very satisfied with this Headset , Logitech for teh win . 	Microphone
I bought one and they never worked . I bought another pair , they never worked either . I wish I could tell you about the quality , but two broken pair of headphones and I will not try another one . Save your money and the headache . Spend more and get a decent pair or go without . It will save you time , money , and asprin because all the headaches it will give you . 	Microphone
For those of you looking for a generic driver because you are mounting the camera sideways or upside down under the monitor , there is none ! I 've looked . HOWEVER , download ManyCam and you 'll be able to flip the image ! Than have Skype get it 's video source from ManyCam ! I did this and the camera works like a charm hanging from below my monitor . You can disable the ManyCam logo and nobody will even know the difference : -RRB- I 'm sure any other webcam programs will work , this was just the one I found when searching for `` how to rotate a video '' through Skype 's Support Network . Great webcam for the price ! Construction of the mount is surprisingly good ! Supposedly the lights turn by an automatic sensor on the camera ? Have n't tested this out yet . 	Microphone
I bought this to tape classes . It 's a nifty little machine for this task . It uses regular size cassettes that I can listen to in the van to get the most out of my lectures . Easy to use . 	Microphone
I 've been using this for about six weeks . It replaced a cheap $ 20 unit that had one earpiece and a boom mike that had inadequate pickup . First , the earpieces . I 'd heard that some folks had complaints about these things being delicate and difficult to replace . It came with two extras . The sound quality in the earpieces is phenomenal . It is LOUD ! I have to turn down the volume on my phone all the way usually . In the occasional situations where someone calls me with a really weak voice , I can turn up the sound and no problem . So the sound that the earpieces produce is nothing short of outstanding . Second , the boom mike . I tested it with several folks who said good things about the sound quality . It seems best with the mike about two inches from my mouth . Third , the headset comfort . My only complaint about the performance of this thing is that the padding on the headset -LRB- i.e. , where the frame touches your head -RRB- is inadequately padded . It could use some more padding . It would be nice if it were padded all across the top of the frame , instead of being padding-free in the middle . So its comfort suffers somewhat because of this . If I wore it all the time , this would be a bigger deal . Fortunately , I only put it on when talking on the phone , so this is less of an issue for me . Note that you MUST buy a separate piece in order for this to work for you ! This unit will NOT plug into your phone . You need to buy an adapter that plugs into your phone . Exactly which one is appropriate for you depends on the phone . For me , I needed a CCEL-191 headset cable -LRB- $ 22.18 -RRB- , which works fine . Overall , while this thing is really pretty pricey , I 'm quite happy with it . 	Microphone
This LOGITECH USB Microphone is well made and easy to install . Just plug into a USB port and go ! The mike has a light that comes on when the mike is active and ready to use . It has great sound quality and I am very happy with my purchase . In addition , I have used this microphone in PowerPoint and also in other programs where I need to narrate and the sound quality is excellent . The best this is the ON and OFF switch at the base of the microphone which is a feature found on the more expensive microphones . So I 100 % recommend this microphone . 	Microphone
So I bought these for my boyfriend and I to each have one so we could talk and keep in touch since we live so far away . For the price and the quality they are ok . The picture is a little fuzzy and depending on the internet connection we have we sometimes have issues . Make sure your computer is updated and has enough RAM and GB for the kind of quality you want . I have to add more RAM to mine so that the quality is going to be good since my laptop is 4 years old . For the price it 's good and the quality is ok ... it works for us , but if you want a nicer picture you might want to get a better web camera . 	Microphone
I own a Sennheiser HD 280 Pro headphone and wanted to be able to talk to people over Skype without spending too much money or downgrading my sound quality with a cheap headset . This clip on mic was just about the only option for this I found . It gets the job done . For the price of this mic I believe the sound quality is good . If your headphones have reasonably thick cords than the Zalman mic attaches to them without a problem . However , my headphone cords do n't naturally come close to my mouth . Zalman really should have had the clip extend a couple inches from the mic . In order to get people to hear me with this mic I have to adjust my headphones so the cord crosses my face near my mouth a little awkwardly . Even then I have to talk a little loudly to be certain people will hear me . Setting up a +10 db boost under your microphone settings I believe is necessary in order to use this product with reasonable success . Tip for those complaining about their headphones having cords too small : I find if I wear a collared shirt , pop the collar , and attach the clip to the very uppermost tip then it fits in securely and is close enough to my mouth that people can hear me about as well as if I use my headphone cord . This will depend on the shirt , and you 'll look like a tool , but it works . 	Microphone
I think this headset is fairly good . It 's cheap indeed but the quality is good . The timber sounds really good in my opinion . The only disadvantage is that it is small and thin . Does n't look that cool for some guys . 	Microphone
Bought these for a flight back east and it made the whole experience bearable . Isolates the sound of the engines , delivers a very flat response so they are not for those who believe in thumping bass . You need to practice putting them in as if you get it wrong they can hurt a bit but once you get it down they are great . I used these for my first listen of Raising Sand and they were\/are the perfect choice . Do n't wear these if you need to hear what is going on around you . 	Microphone
These buds are SWEET : excellent sound , super comfortable and dead easy controls . Nice touch with the free Klipsch app in Android Market . Three things : 1 . -RRB- Set up your control options then reboot your phone . App does n't jive until you do . 2 . -RRB- When controlling volume , do n't hold the button down until it responds with a beep . If you do , you 've increased the volume by two clicks . Gets loud fast . Just make your `` long press '' a little shorter . It will increase the volume by a single click . Takes a minute to figure out . 3 . -RRB- Cord is perfect length , if way curly . With your phone in your pocket and the cord fairly straight , you 're golden . Soon as you take the buds out and put them down , cord squiggles back up , but it makes it easier to fit into the hilariously tiny carrying case . Very stoked about the call control . Phoned a few people to test it out and all reported no difference between my voice through the phone v. through the mic . And the callers sound just as clear . Saw some complaints about collars or long hair rubbing the cord and being able to hear it . If that 's your deal , your buds are busted . If you picked properly sized flanges , you should n't be able to hear a thing other than what 's playing , with no distortion from cord contact with other surfaces . Gator clip in the case if you prefer to tack your cord . DROID Bionic with cubed music player , TuneIn Radio , EQualizer 	Microphone
this little webcam is pretty good for the price , just plug it in the USB port and Bob 's your uncle . The picture is pretty good , the subject , not so good , but that 's a different topic . The only complaint is the camera just sort of sits on the laptop screen without any real locking , therefore it is easily jarred , but for the price it is a definite value . 	Microphone
As soon as I opened the headphones , there was a rattling sound coming out of the left earpiece . The sound was average , I 've had seven dollar sony earbuds that sound the same , They are however comfortable headphones . I would stay away from skullcandy as their quality control is horrible . The material used is also cheap . For the price get a pair of Sony MDR-7506 's 	Microphone
this microphone works very well with Dragon , Naturally Speaking . the switch on the microphone is especially convienent to stop & start the dictation . A big improvement over other microphones used with Dragon and a very attractive price . 	Microphone
i do n't care about sound quality . i care that a pair of cheap headphones let me have phone conversations without breaking within a month . the good news is that they never broke . the bad news is i never used them enough to give them the chance - the microphone is so poor that no one could understand what i was saying . in a word : worthless . 	Microphone
I was looking for some quality earphones with a mic on them for my 2nd Gen iPod touch . These are almost there ... sound quality is less than desired , but that 's expected for the price . The mic picks up sound well . 	Microphone
These are my favorite listening headphones for my iPhone , bar none . They have great resonance and balanced sound - not too bassy , not too high-end tinny like many other ear buds . I was mortified when they stopped working a few weeks ago , after about a year . I contacted thinksound about the issue , and they immediately sent replacement ear buds , then followed up with suggestions on how to keep the problem from recurring with the new ear buds . I could not have asked for better , more prompt or personal customer service for a great product . 	Microphone
What a piece of junk . Plugged it in . . no power , the plug in the back is sloppy , I think it came broken . Went to attach the WIFI antenna and it was in 2 pieces , also broken . Do n't waist your money . Sure sounded good , but thats what I got , something that sounded too good to be true . 	Microphone
Just awful . I have to tilt my head down just so people can hear me . I would n't recommend to anyone . What a joke 	Microphone
I have used these headphones for the past five -LRB- 5 -RRB- years , they have been marvelous . Great sound quality and people on the other end say I boom into their headphones . I just ordered another set as my current set have given up the ghost after five -LRB- 5 -RRB- years . Good longevity for a $ 20 investment five -LRB- 5 -RRB- years ago . I expect the set I ordered to last the same amount of time . 	Microphone
best headphone ever just ass good as beats . they are very durable and will last long plus u can represent ur fav teams . 	Microphone
Came nicely packaged and all but , Computer does not recognize headset , nothing happens when I plug them in . I know the plug works because I can plug in normal headphones just fine . The Jack size fits , IDK what the problem is ; I tried everything . 	Microphone
Crystal clear sound . As the previous review states , its even good for singing . Good price too . 	Microphone
Although I ordered the white CyberAcoustics Desktop Mic-48 shown in the photo , the Dynex DX-54 -LRB- with a CyberAcoustics logo -RRB- was sent to me . Amazon needs to update the photo . The mic performs well and sounded more pleasant than a slightly more expensive USB desktop boom mic . I recommend this mic for general use , and feel Amazon 's pricing is reasonable . 	Microphone
It works exactly as described . I used this to shoot a video and the sound was perfect . We were a good 5-8ft away and were n't speaking very loudly but with this microphone it was clear and easy to understand what we were saying . It was exactly what I was looking for to complete my project . Glad I purchased this item . 	Microphone
This microphone picks up sound just fine . No complaints about that . If you are using the mic without the battery supply it should be great . I need the battery supply . I have three complaints : 1 . The required battery is an odd type . Why not go with something standard ? 2 . The battery holder is gimpy . Difficult to open . Awkwardly shaped , it creates an inconvenient package in the middle of the mic line . Where do you put this when the mic is on your lapel ? I do n't know . The design is not helpful . It would be better to just have a bigger mic with the battery inside it and leave out the separate battery holder . 3 . Battery switch is confusing . I 'm getting used to it , but when you switch it on the battery indicator does n't stay on , so you ca n't tell by looking if it 's on or not . Makes it difficult to remember to turn it on or off , which is almost a deal breaker for someone like me . 	Microphone
it was a really good webcam for something that it very small they only little problem i had with it was how loud the mic is but you can fix it if you go to your microphone options so besides that I LOVE IT ! 	Microphone
I love the sound and the in-ear fit of the HF2 . I 've had various over and in-ear headsets since the 80s , and by far , these sound the best . They also fit in my ear perfectly , identical to the earplugs I like to use , once they 're in , they stay in . They fit so much better than the Apple buds included with any iPod or iPhone I 've owned , there 's just no comparison . But . . I 'm on my 2nd HF2 , and it just died on me . Self destructed is more like it , wire insulation\/covering split from left earbud almost all the way down the the L\/R split . The first set , the wires seemed to lose their connection just past the plug . Nothing this expensive should break this easily ... As I 've already had them replaced once -LRB- sent back red ones instead of black , shrug -RRB- , they seem to be considered out of warranty ? -LRB- 2yr warranty ? -RRB- Still waiting to hear back on what can\/will be done w \/ this second set . I do n't abuse my gear . I still have a c1980 cassette walkman that still works like new , as well as the orig 5GB iPod . . I am NOT rough with my gear . This is the most expensive thing I plug into my iPods\/iPhones and they ca n't seem to last a full year of regular use . When I scrape together enough cash , I 'll prob . grab a set of HF3s and use them at home and the office , and use the Apple buds everywhere else -LRB- in car , at customers , in the backyard . . etc -RRB- . . I love the sound , I love the fit , but they 're just way too fragile for everyday\/everywhere use for me . . 	Microphone
Works great with my Droid 3 , I also downloaded the App for the controls . Pro , They sound great . Controls work . Cons , the button control is small . It did not come with a nice hard case\/flashlight like the 4I 's did . 	Microphone
No problem in voice recognition , gaming -LRB- bfbc2 , COD titles , MOH titles , Velve games -LRB- HL\/CSS -RRB- , F1 2010 , Fifa and many others -RRB- work great with this mic . plug and play , works like its supposed to . Had it over 6 months now , no problem at ALL ! RECOMMENDED ! 	Microphone
For such a low price , these headphones work extremely well . Unless you are very serious about the kind of headphones you use , these are perfect . I can still hear what people are saying around me when I am using them but it is not a problem for me . Sometimes after wearing them for a long amount of time they need to be adjusted because they hurt my ears . Otherwise no problems . 	Microphone
I waited the whole week just to get these , I was REALLY exited to see if what everyone has been saying was even true , and so it was . The version I got was a M9P With a box with Purple and black , different than what I have seen . The box is nice . Now , onto the review . This thing comes packed with a Carrying case , 2 double flanged eartips , one is black and one is gray -LRB- From what I have seen the gray are `` Balanced sound '' . I tried them out and it is more balanced than the other eartips but there is less bass -RRB- , and small , medium , and large olive type eartips . Mine did not come with an airplane adapter but who cares . It had a cable wrap to wrap the cable around because the cable is very long , but honestly it sucks and does n't do a great job at holding the cable together without coming off . The case is very handy and nice and has a hard shell on it with a pocket on the side . Not onto the actual headphones . The wire on in is very nice ! It seems very sturdy and seems like it will hold up to some beating , but it has alot of memory to it -LRB- If you bend it for a long time it will take a while for it to straighten up -RRB- . The actual plug is at a 45 Degree angle and is very nice . The Mic on the headphones works surprisingly well and the button and Mic works both on my Samsung Captivate -LRB- Which has TRRS connector which has a inverted ground and Mic -RRB- And my dad 's iPhone . It does not have volume control which is no biggie . The headphones itself have a very nice aluminum housing , and a good stress relief for the wire . Overall for this price it is a steal for these features . Now to the sound quality itself . I am an avid listener to music such as Techno , 8bit , and Alternative music and I find these very very good for the price ! The headphones sit comfortably well in your ears one you find your right ear-tips but I do notice sometimes it feels as if the headphones are sucking on your ears . The sound isolation is like every other IEM out there , its not like noise canceling headphones , these are like earplugs . Ok . NOW to sound quality . The bass is Very very good , the bass is so loud I had to turn it down in my equalizer to make it comfortable to listen to . I was extremely satisfied with the bass response on these things especially for the price . The mids\/vocals are slightly low but I also had to turn it up in my equalizer nothing too special here . Now the Highs are a little too harsh and gets slightly distorted especially on high notes and crashes , but also had to turn it down on the EQ . Now , if you do n't have a graphic equalizer on your device , like an iPod or iPhone , it might be a slight problem . I have not burned these in yet but will later on . Overall the sound quality on these are very good for the price and all the extras you get in the box ! I will post a video review in the future and post some pictures later on once I think these hold up to the test of normal everyday listening . Thank you MEelectronics !!!!! P.S. . If your pair sucks for some reason , MEelectronics Quality control does suck , so just contact them at their website to get another pair . I heard their customer service is great so just do that instead of complaining about it because mine are perfect out of the box . 	Microphone
I thought I 'd try the HF2 's after I lost my ER-4P 's , being sold on the `` almost ER-4P '' like sound and the silicon leads to eliminate cable noise - this made the HR2 's a deal I could n't pass up . I 've previously owned the ER-6i 's as well . So far out of all the Etymotic earphones I 've owned these are the least accurate and most `` blah '' sounding , giving a compressed feel to the music being played , with little soundstage . I 've compared the quality of 192k recordings through iTunes as well as digital recordings played back through Logic Pro at full 44k resolution . I have to say that while these are great , they 're not fantastic , and I 've come to expect fantastic from Etymotic . The ER-4P was many times better in terms of sound stage and accuracy . I feel like the ER-6i was better in terms of sound accuracy and sound stage , although it 's been years since I owned those . I would not purchase these again after owning the ER-4P 's , and my next replacements for these will be ER-4P 's again , despite the cost . 	Microphone
This headset should have lasted longer ! After a few months of occasional use the jacks stopped fitting well - the sound would come out only after fiddling with them , pushing them in or out in a certain way . After 9 months , it stopped working all together . I 'm going to look for a different brand next time . Otherwise it fits well . I like the adjustable microphone . 	Microphone
This thing is so easy and use and is way better then my gaming mic on my other headsets . Its loud and clear my other mics cant compare to these 5 STARS all i can say !!! 	Microphone
Easy to use , and the sound quality delivers . I wanted something to record my guitar ideas and this is great . I ca n't make demos with it cause no one would wanna listen to a guitar recorded with this but it works well enough for me to listen to my guitar and figure out what I played . Maybe if you 're good you can do youtube demos with good audio quality but I 'm a metal player so for not having many catchy riffs , I 'll need good audio quality to make up for it , so I wo n't be using this for that . I understand that most people do n't use these as a studio mic so I wo n't rate it based on that . If you just want to record your voice then I guess your search ends here . The price is great . It 's nice to have a mic . 	Microphone
I was wanted to improve on my computer 's call quality in Lync by switching from the Logitech Orbit Webcam 's built-in microphone to this one . But while the audio quality was good , the volume was way less than that of the Orbit . I went back to using the Orbit . 	Microphone
I 've owned all sorts of in-ear monitors since Sony made them popular over five years ago . The general trend with these headphones is that sound quality and durability are mostly top-notch at the $ 70 mark and definitely top-notch over the $ 100 mark . Anything I 've tried that was under the $ 30 mark has usually been unsurprisingly unremarkable . Until now . The sound quality on my MEE M6P-8Ks , surprisingly , surpasses my Klipsch s3 and s4i headphones . Bassheads will rejoice with these , as low notes are boomy and energetic without being overpowering like many headphones in its price class tend to be . It still might be too bassy for some , particularly classical fans . Its midrange is balanced and nicely compliments its clear and exceptional performance on the highs . I would n't go as far to say that these replace the tried-and-true studio-quality units , but it excels for most purposes , especially for the price . I 'm also extremely glad that the company chose to emphasise its over-the-ear style with extra reinforcement at the driver tips ; this is usually a luxury reserved for more expensive pairs . The shape of its drivers , in fact , is another treat that 's usually exclusive to `` professional '' grade heapdhones ; it comforms to the inside of the outer ear to give it a custom-molded appearance and , more importantly , a profile that does n't protrude very much . This is a nice bonus for folks that enjoy wearing hats on top of their headphones . Its pre-supplied tips are easy on the ears and should be good for extended periods of listening . Your mileage may vary , however ; my left ear canal is slightly bent , so using most IEMs with it tends to be a challenge . I ca n't recommend these headphones highly enough . If sound quality is an unshakable priority in your headphone selection and you like saving money , these are for you . 	Microphone
It states its got a dynamic mic . It does not . It has an electret mic and a battery box in series with the microphone to provide power . It states the phones are noise canceling - not really . They reduce outside noise passively by covering your ears , but there is no active noise cancellation . This is not the product it appears to be . 	Microphone
Great for the first couple of weeks then the connection for the headphones no longer works 100 % and has to be fiddled with to get sound . Disappointed . 	Microphone
Its a wonderful headphone and its really cheap too . I so love it . . the voice is crystal clear and it does n't hurt the ear too . I simply adore it . I 'd definitely suggest this to others . 	Microphone
The headset is very good . The headphones as well as mic are top notch ... I make some very long distance calls -LRB- US - India -RRB- from my laptop and the mic works like a charm even for hours . Works even when the speaker is above my head . The mute-mic switch is also useful if you want to back bitch about the person you are talking to . Just kidding , but I highly recommend these . Its every bit worth the 20 bucks . 	Microphone
i just got the earphones today and I a was amazed with the sound quality and the bass is just great !! It fits great on my ears ... first time i wrote a review on an item and i was just excited to spread on how I am very pleased with my purchased ... I will definitely recommend this product ... 	Microphone
These are a great set of head phones , good quality . Would purchase again . Replaced 2 different pairs of headphones with these . 	Microphone
I do n't like it the sound quality is poor . I really do n't recommend it to anyone ! It is uncomfortable on your head and I ca n't stand to wear it ! 	Microphone
Got them because I wanted something nice for a low price . These do great at sealing your ear , so not too much outside noise can be heard . They are bass heavy compared to most , but if that 's what you listen to , these are a great choice . I 'm not too sure how durable the cord is , but other than that a great buy for the price ! 	Microphone
I use this headset with a ham radio , an Elecraft K3 . This radio allows you to plug a mic and headphones into 1\/8 '' jacks on the rear panel in addition to a traditional ham\/cb type connection on the front of the radio . These ` phones sound great and are comfortable for hours at a time . I get unsolicited reports of great audio on the air frequently . On occasion I 've plugged them into the laptop beside the radio to listen to mp3 's and they 're better than the Koss headphones I normally use which are quite good themselves . I 've had them for about 6 months and durability seems good so far , I have n't had any issues . Hard to go wrong for under $ 20 . 	Microphone
I am no audiophile , but i think the sound quality is decent . If you turn the volume to MAX , the sound quality deteriorates a little . I can not believe how uncomfortable this headphone is . The ear piece is so small that it does not cover the entire ear . And therefore it hurts cause it bends your ear . You can wear it for no longer than 5 min . I bought this mainly to use for internet chat . But the mic is weirdly placed and as mentioned before you have to speak loudly for the other person to hear you . You have to speak very clearly for the mic to register your voice , otherwise it will just filter out some parts thinking it to be noise . Overall , I am disappointed with the purchase . I guess i will keep it as a spare . 	Microphone
No inline volume control but these sound just fine and mic works great and other on Ventrilo said the mic on it sounds better then my other headset 's . 	Microphone
The MEElectronics M6 is a great pair of in ear headphone , ESPECIALLY for the price . The amount of accessories -LRB- clamshell case , good assortment of eartips , and a shirt clip -RRB- you get is almost unheard of at this price range . Both comfort and build quality were good , PROVIDED you can get it to fit . Because of its size and the memory wire , you MAY have problems getting this to stay in your ear . Sound quality is stellar , again , FOR THE PRICE . When you consider the competition is stuff like Skullcandy and random `` MADE-FOR-IPOD '' i-this and i-that earbuds -LRB- which usually choose form over function -RRB- , these are actually quite amazing . The most noticeable aspect of the M6 is the bass . It is deep and powerful and will satisfy all but the bassheads . The midrange is clear although a little bit distant due to the boosted bass . The highs were also well done and maintains good clarity throughout but it is slightly harsh in certain spots . The sound is very consumer friendly and will fit most popular genres . Compared to the MEElectronics M9 , their sound is fairly close but the M9 has significantly more bass quantity . Both offer a fantastic value so choose according to your sound signature preference . To address those that are having problems with the build , here are two things to note : 1 -RRB- Since these were first introduced , the remote\/microphone has since been updated and is now less prone to having the wires fall apart . 2 -RRB- MEElectronics have GREAT customer service , if your headphone falls apart , I can almost guarantee they will take care of you . Overall , great sound at a great price backed up by a great company . What more can you ask ? 	Microphone
The sound quality on these are inferior to anything I 've ever heard . If you are n't picky about your sound quality , these will probably be ok . The mic works great . Besides the sound , I am a female with a small head and these felt tight even on me ! After several minutes of wearing , my head is sore . Right now , I just wear them around my neck for the mic and keep my Bose headphones on . 	Microphone
I 'm not an audiophile , though I have a decently large lossless collection . I got these earbuds for my Samsung Captivate which is running Voodoo Sound . I wanted an upgrade from the stock earbuds but I could n't justify spending big money on them . These had pretty good reviews on head-fi and elsewhere , so I figured they were worth a $ 20 gamble . First impressions were harsh : lows were weak and punchless , highs were harsh and painful . I almost returned them , but I 'd read that the manufacturer recommends a lengthy burn in period . So I ran my jazz collection through them for about 36 hours and tried again ... I was genuinely surprised . The highs mellowed out while gaining in brightness . Lows were stronger and punchy , though some might find them still a bit on the weak side -LRB- I do n't , but I boost the low end through the poweramp EQ -RRB- . Mids were crisp , textured , and immersive . Aside from the sound , the build quality seems quite good -LRB- though I do n't subject my equipment to much stress -RRB- . I like that they come with a semi-hard shell case for storage . These are my first over-the-ear headphones and they can be tricky at first but you quickly get used to it . The inline mic works well enough - no complaints yet from any callers . On the whole , very satisfied with these earbuds . 	Microphone
I purchased this headset to use with my Dragon Naturally Speaking 9 program and I have been very pleased . It is the most comfortable headset I have owned without a hugh price tag . It also picks up my voice better than other ones do so that when I am dictating , there are fewer errors in what my computer hears and types . I 'd highly recommend them for educational purposes as well as work and easy listening . 	Microphone
They have deteriorated in workmanship over the past two years . Finally I have moved on to other brands . It only last 2-3 months with careful daily usage . This would be my third pair within the past 9 months . Careful with this purchase . 	Microphone
Great microphone . No static or fuzziness when recording , relatively sturdy design , long wire to reach your computer . Installation is a breeze ; just plug it in and you 're done . Obviously it 's not made for recording music or anything like that , so do n't be trying to mix a song using this . But for $ 30 it 's a great microphone for talking to people online . 	Microphone
Terrific head phones that fit my ear better than any I 've ever had , even Sennheiser 's . They pretty much block out outside noises -- which is great or not so great , depending on your perspective . Terrific sound in every way , plus they come with a carrying case , which is useful to keep them from getting tangled . Worth the money . 	Microphone
I purchased this headset for my son to use for play by play sports broadcasting . It has features -LRB- boom mic , over the ear noise isolation , a very long cable , and rugged construction -RRB- of high end broadcasting headsets for about 1\/3 the cost of the most reasonably priced `` professional '' style broadcasting headsets . The voice quality is good and the headset is comfortable to wear for extended periods -LRB- 2-3 hour football games -RRB- . It comes wired with separate 3.5 mm plugs for microphone and headphones and includes two adapters to convert each from 3.5 mm to 1\/4 '' for use with standard audio mixers . It is important to note that the microphone is the type used by PC sound cards and not the types typically used for professional recording -LRB- dynamic or condenser -RRB- . However , this ships with a battery powered microphone adapter -LRB- uses one 1.5 V AA battery -RRB- to facilitate usage with a standard audio mixer . Although the adapter works fairly well , I replaced it with a custom unit I built myself with parts from Radio Shack . I would definitely recommend this for anyone looking for an entry level sports broadcasting headset . 	Microphone
Very fragile . Mic stopped working after few days of usage . Just by holding it in your hands , you can tell that it is very fragile 	Microphone
These cameras are great . The signal between the camera and the receiver is n't very strong . I ordered a second receiver to address this issue and now I do n't have any problems with reception . The night vision in the house was great but is not as good outside . We have 2 set up near motion detector lights , so it is n't too much of a problem . They do not like my microwave , however . -LRB- The microwave is between the cameras and the receiver -RRB- Not a big , big problem since we only use it when we 're home ... 	Microphone
These earphones do a very good job of blocking surrounding sound . The bass is very good , but is not booming or over done . The mid and highs are solid and not colored in any way . I have really enjoyed the listening experience they provide . The mic works very well for recoding and phone use . 	Microphone
i order this mic coz most of the headphones always seem to break down . i plugged it in and set the settings , and everyone heard me clear . they say they dont hear my background noise anymore . so i say this is the best mic i ever bought 	Microphone
Bought 2 of these . One went for a Windows 7 Lap Top \/ The other for an older Dell Desktop XP . Both were easily installed -LRB- just plugged them into the USB port -RRB- and both work very well . HD it 's not , but I have no complaints . Have been able to Skype my family each night . 	Microphone
I had initially given this company a negative review however their customer service was about as good as it gets ! The mic in the headset did not work . I gave them poor feedback and now would like to change that . The item itself is of medium quality : the bass response is somewhat lacking and mic sensitivity necessitated being very close to the Mic when speaking -LRB- which could be a plus in noisy environments -RRB- . However , as soon as I filed for a return , a return label was emailed to me and I received a personal call asking , `` what can we do to make this right for you ? '' which I thought was a very considerate touch . I told them , you can send a second headset and let me see if its truly defective or just a poorly manufactured product . They immediately overnighted a second unit to me , before I had even returned the defective one . Sure enough , the second headset Mic demonstrated much better sensitivity and proved the first was indeed defective . This company is to be exemplified when it comes to customer service . They were prompt , gracious and willing to satisfy my requests . Companies like this are golden . While the product is only so-so , it does work well and the Company itself deserves 5 STARS ! Well done people . I would not hesitate to buy from them again and highly recommend doing business with them . Thanks for your care and great customer service ! - A happy customer - 	Microphone
"First off , love the shape of it ! First thought when I opened the box , `` I own a Transformer ! '' lol but in all seriousness , it works great , great picture quality , and the mic works nicely . The only problem with mine is that the lens is I guess crooked ? I 'm not sure but when I have it facing me DIRECTLY half my face is out of the frame . Other than that , this is a good product all in all . <ahref=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004FLJ4YI/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/185-4071578-1832839""> Kinobo USB `` Origami '' Webcam 5mpx for Laptop\/LCD\/Desktop + USB microphone for Skype </a> "	Microphone
Good fit earphones with excellent mic quality . Comes with a case and definitely an upgrade from the iphone headphones . The white looked really cool too . Not the best headphones out there but the best for the money 	Microphone
Really good headset for the price . I 've tried a variety of budget headsets for gaming use , including several Logitechs . Thus far these are probably the most comfortable , and most durable . They also have remarkably good sound quality for the price . Overall a great headset . 	Microphone
This product is great ... if you want a cheap piece of junk to last you for a couple weeks . I used it and thought it was quite convenient , I liked the play\/pause button and the mic worked fine . One day I was pulling it out of my pocket and the entire faceplate fell off and exposed the innards to my eyes ... it was seriously something I could have put together in a matter of seconds . I am an amateur electrician so I put it back together and it worked fine ... until the headphone jack shorted out ... I attempted to fix this , but the jack was impossible to find a replacement for without making wires stick out of the casing . So now I can only hear out of one ear when using the headphones through the mic . Specifics : Pros : Low price Nice small microphone Works VERY well with my ipod touch Cons : Weak construction Terrible product quality I would suggest that you try paying a bit more for another product before buying this one .

I do not use my webcam much but the few times I have used it it has worked well . It was cheap and came fast . It is not the most high tech webcam but if you want a cheap alternative for occasional web chats that has a decent picture then , this product might be right for you . 	Microphone
I purchased three of these cameras -LRB- with a 4th on the way -RRB- and am pleased overall with how they perform . However , there do seem to be some bugs and quality control issues that are likely to frustrate people who are n't comfortable troubleshooting network or hardware issues . I 'm using these as monitors to keep track of the kids when I 'm in a different part of our house . My youngest is autistic and tends to get into lots of mischief , so these have come in very handy . They 've already allowed me to intervene on several potentially dangerous or messy situations that I would have otherwise missed until it was too late . ----------- 1st Camera ----------- The first camera I ordered worked almost flawlessly and was easy to setup . After plugging it into my network over ethernet and powering up , it was immediately accessible at 192.168.0.178 -LRB- port 80 -RRB- and I had no problems changing the default IP and port to something else using their search utility tool . After logging in through the browser interface , I changed the admin login and was able to input the settings for my wireless network and the camera still functioned well after rebooting in wifi only mode . The picture looked great , the PTZ controls worked well and I had no problems accessing it from a remote location once port forwarding was setup on my router . I briefly activated the motion detection & email alert feature and was able to confirm it works . The only real negative was that audio on the camera sounded terrible and had a lot of interference ... but I did n't need audio support , so this did n't bother me . I was so impressed by the overall price and quality that I immediately ordered two more cameras . ----------- 2nd Camera ----------- The second camera worked and setup just as easily as the first one . I set it to a different IP , gave it a unique port for remote access and had no issues connecting it to the second wireless network in my house . Like the first camera , audio sounds terrible -LRB- over a wired and wireless connection -RRB- . ----------- 3rd Camera ----------- The third camera worked fine over a wired connection , but not wifi . It would see the available wireless networks in my house and allow me to input & save the settings for one of them ... but as soon as I unplugged ethernet and rebooted the camera ... I could no longer access the camera or see it using their search utility . I tried multiple IP addresses and ports , but nothing worked . After a couple of hours of troubleshooting , it stopped listing available wireless networks entirely and the wifi functionality seemed completely dead . Since that camera still worked over ethernet and was being placed in a room with a network switch , I decided just keep it and use it over a wired connection . In fact , I plan to switch the other two cameras to wired connections as well because I 've noticed speed\/performance drops on other wifi-only devices in our house since setting these cameras up . I assume it is because the cameras in wifi mode are taking up a lot of bandwidth . Audio on the 3rd camera is equally bad as the first two . ------------ Connectivity ------------ After a few days of use , the two that are in wifi-only mode have had to be rebooted a couple of times because they periodically drop off the network and do n't show up using the search utility . Other wifi devices in the house still work when this happens , so I do n't think it 's a problem with my wireless network . The camera that is connected over ethernet has n't had a problem , nor has it needed to be rebooted since mounting it . --------------- Buggy Behavior --------------- Last night , the first camera froze up completely while viewing it from the tinyCam app on my android tablet and rebooting did n't fix the problem . I connected it over ethernet and , although the camera showed up using their search utility , it would no longer accept the administrative login . I ended up doing a factory reset using the button located at the bottom of the camera , but it still would n't accept the factory login -LRB- admin\/123456 -RRB- . Eventually I noticed that the ` DeviceName ' was blank for the camera and it no longer defaulted to 192.168.0.178 , which seemed to indicate that the factory setting were somehow wiped out . I tried logging in with just the default username -LRB- admin -RRB- but left the password field blank . This worked and I was able to login and change the settings back to how I originally had them . It 's been working fine since . Unfortunately , I can not be sure if the connection\/performance problems I 'm having are with the cameras or the software I 've been using to view them . It seems the only time they have frozen up is when I 'm using software that supports the audio & recording capabilities -LRB- Internet Explorer , IPCMonitor , 3rd party surveillance software , etc -RRB- . I have n't had any problems using the browser based interface with Chrome or Firefox -LRB- which do n't support recording or audio -RRB- . I also have n't had a problem using IP Camera Viewer 1.1 -LRB- which is a freeware utility to view multiple IP cams , but it also lacks support for the audio or recording capabilities of this camera -RRB- . --------------- Summary --------------- Despite the problems I 've had above ... I 'm still happy with these cameras because they were inexpensive and have n't been difficult for me to troubleshoot when there have been problems . This is my first experience using an ip cam , so I have nothing to compare it against in terms of connection reliability or ease of setup . I do n't think you need to be a networking guru to set these up , but you 'll need to understand the basics of home networking and how IP addresses are used\/allocated within your local area network -LRB- LAN -RRB- . You 'll also need to be familiar with port forwarding on your router if you wish to view your camera -LRB- s -RRB- remotely . These concepts may seem daunting at first to a novice user , but they 're easy to learn about with a couple of google searches . PROS : - Very clear picture quality - PTZ controls work well - Camera mount included - Ability to flip\/mirror camera view for ceiling mounted cameras - Motion detection with email\/audio\/ftp \/ msn alerts . - Ability to add multiple login accounts with different levels of access -LRB- Admin , operator or visitor -RRB- - Compatible with iPhone\/Android cam viewers - Price CONS : - Poor\/Unusable audio - Questionable reliability over wifi - Off brand that may lack profile support with 3rd party surveillance software = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = UPDATE : 03\/14\/20123 = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = ------------ 4th Camera ------------ The fourth camera arrived and it was branded as ` EasyN ' instead of a ` Wansview ' . Aside from the logo on the camera & slightly different style mount , the camera itself looks the same . However , the browser-based viewing interface & settings area look completely different -LRB- though essentially provide the same functions -RRB- . The EasyN cam seems a little slower to repond to PTZ commands and night vision is definitely less clear than the Wansview cams -LRB- day time viewing still looks good -RRB- . It also boots into patrol mode and is unresponsive until it finishes a couple of circuits . I 've searched for a way to disable this behavior , but have n't found anything yet . Like the Wansview Cameras , audio is still pretty poor and has a lot of static\/interferance . On the other hand , unlike the three previous Wansview cameras I reviewed ... I am able to use the ` TALK ' feature that allows the camera to function as an intercom , which is pretty darn neat . There are audio ports on all of these cameras , and I had previously assumed that I needed an external speaker connected to the unit to utilize that feature . So either the EasyN view has an internal speaker that the Wansview brand lacks ... or this feature is disabled or nonfunctioning in the Wansview cameras . Another thing to note is that the EasyN camera arrived in much better packaging than that of the Wansview version . All parts were securely encased in molded foam padding and the box was printed with the brand\/model . The wansview cameras arrived in all-white boxes that used molded cardboard as padding . Overall , I still prefer the UI & performance of the Wansview cameras ... but the Talk\/Intercom functionality -LRB- without an external speaker -RRB- on the EasyN is really nice . 	Microphone
This is a very good headset . I bought it in Jan 2011 for my home cordless telephone . It has quality sound . I give it four stars because I still have not been able to figure out just how to place the earpiece over\/behind my ear . However , it fits perfectly in the ear . I highly recommend it if you are not concern with fitting it over the ear ; I find it quite confortable just pushing it into the ear . I would purchase it again . 	Microphone
At the computer store I help out with , I have tried to set up the camera and everything went wrong . Poor software , poor documentation and everything else went wrong . Do not buy the camera at all . It is a waste of money and it is n't even worth trying to get it to work properly . 	Microphone
I got these awesome in ears a few weeks ago . I 've used them for a good amount of listening already . They 're good . Better than what I thought i was gonna get for ten or twelve bucks . They have great isolation , they fit really well and dont hurt . Not only that but the construction quality is off the charts . They 're a single piece of either stainless steel or aluminum but either way it works well . They have a carrying case , a bunch of ear thingies . Great purchase . 	Microphone
The old problem with these headphones I have is the short chord , but that is a personal preference . These are great for the price , I am going to order another pair as a gift . 	Microphone
For this price , You can not beat it ! I think it sounds pretty clear and for this price , It 's the best mic . BUY THIS BEFORE IT GOES OUT OF STOCK ! Make sure you plug in BOTH plugs , green and pink or it will not work , also Make sure you talk pretty close to the mic , almost touching the mic . My friends find it sounds better when the foam is off the mic . BUY TODAY ! 	Microphone
These earbuds are fantastic ! Pros : The bass is incredible for the great rock music that you have . The acoustics are just as good as you would find in a normal set of earbuds -LRB- very good in other words -RRB- . Cons : The smaller size does not produce as much bass as the bigger size , but it is good if you like the acoustics more and want decent bass . They work alright when you are walking but when the cords touch your body you can here it . I have n't tried them while running but I 'm sure they wo n't be much better . Overall , very good earbuds . I would compare them to beats earbuds , so just save the $ 110 dollars and buy these . 	Microphone
Works well when using Rosetta Stone and watching movies ; good voice recognition with easily adjustable mic and good sound quality when watching movies\/TV . Makes my ears hurt after an hour . The height of the headset is adjustable , but width is not , so it will squeeze your ears -LRB- and I have a smallish head -RRB- . 	Microphone
for the price of this headset i think that is hard to find something better . 	Microphone
These headphones are good especially for the price . The sound is good as well . They do get a little uncomfortable after a while and it could be better if it had a little microphone but otherwise , its a good product for a good price . 	Microphone
Works wonderfully . Received the product within a week of ordering . Love the large capacity and large turntable . We would definitely recommend this product to our friends . Great quality at a good price . 	Microwave
I am very pleased with the oven . It cooks all types of meals very quickly and evenly . It is very easy to use . I like the stainless steel finish . 	Microwave
It is no surprise that most parts of the product these day are made of plastic . This goes with this microwave oven too . The door is real light . Just does not have a solid feel . Other than that , everything is what a microwave I expected to be , works great . The dimension fits perfectly in the opening of the cabinet . One improvement could be the push button for the door . With the plastic button , figure prints are always visible . Would be better if the button is cromed . 	Microwave
We have been using this for 6 months now with no issues . I bought a 3 year warranty just in case , since some reviewers mentioned some bad units existed . Beautiful SS microwave with many features , that we do n't usually use . We just use the basic heat function like most others . We also bought the trim kit for this and it was a perfect replacement to our home builders included Microwave . Update July 2012 : At the 9 month mark , I 'm noticing that the door lock springs are too strong . I have to push the open button firmly and sometimes it does n't open on the first try . I think a softer spring for the door latch would have been better . Also , the lack of a quick '30 seconds ' button is becoming apparently , as I need to use the dial to time anything less than 1 minute . It does have a ' 1 minute ' button , but often times , 30 seconds is all I need . 	Microwave
A very good microwave overall . This was my first electronics order from Amazon . Very disappointed that the product had obvious damage to the metal frame on the back of the unit . Amazon did refund me 20 % . I think it should have been more like 30-35 % . Not sure if the damage occurred during shipping or whether it was missed during inspection at the factory . I would be very reluctant to order any large electronic or bulky item from this site . 	Microwave
Panasonic 1.2 cu ft , 1200 watt replaces a Genius Premiere 1000 . Genius 1200 is very good . It appears to raise efficiency from 60 to 80 % . It will , however , take months to figure the transition from older oven to new . It would be helpful if the technical details of achieving P-10 through P-1 were detailed . Some of us who do use decimal math and probabilities when we cook would find this helpful . 	Microwave
This microwave shut down after only 2 minutes of use . I unplugged it , left it for about 10 minutes , then plugged it in again , and it seemed to be working . Then I started microwaving again . After about 2 minutes , it died again . The salesman at Bed Bath and Beyond told me that there was a 20-25 % return rate on this item , and that it should be considered a ` temporary ' microwave . I did n't realize how ` temporary ' it was going to be . We should all boycott Chinese electronic items . There is no quality control . This is my third bad experience -LRB- in only a few months -RRB- with sub-standard Chinese electronics products . I had to return the other items too . 	Microwave
I have had this for over three months and it has only worked for a couple of weeks . So far it has been into service three times and must of cost Panasonic at least twice its value . My gas bills driving back and forth are greater than the value of the microwave . Every time I contact Panasonic , they keep sending me the same service center information . Still does n't work . Time to cut my losses and put it in the trash . My Sharp lasted 10 years . Back to Sharp . Oh - the problem this time around is that it will not heat anything smaller than about a quart of water . Can not reheat a mug of coffee as it cuts out after a few seconds ... it stops and clears all memory including the clock . 	Microwave
This purchase replaced another Panasonic that I had for 9 years and really liked . This model is just as nice and has new features that I 'm still learning to use . The feature that I really like , is also the same one that I dislike a bit . It has sensor cooking which is great , except that there is no countdown to time , so I 'm always guessing how long things will take . I like the warm feature . Over all I am pleased and would recommend this product . 	Microwave
I bought this item it was compact and great , a year later the door button broke from the inside of the unit and the door locked . i opened it tried to fix it but the hinge was made out of plastic and had broke . Then it stopped heating up food so i threw it away , they should invest more int he parts they use . 	Microwave
I am very satisfied with our microwave choice . This is to be used in a small dormitory sized apartment , and it works good while still being very compact in size . 	Microwave
This oven works great and offers a lot of options . It is better than what I expected . It was shipped rapidly . I am very happy with this purchase . 	Microwave
Great product and shipped well . Slim - not as tall as most microwaves so be aware of that if you are expecting it to be the same size as the usual ones . Great for small spaces and dorms . 	Microwave
This barely covers a 6 '' diameter bowl even though it 's supposed to be a 7 '' cover . I have no idea what to use it for other than to put it over mugs when heating cocoa or milk . 	Microwave
We purchased this nice microwave about a month ago to replace our 20 year old microwave from my college years . It never died , but was small and not very powerful . This Panasonic is certainly not small . It is huge . Be sure to measure where you want it . We 'd redone our kitchen and had a microwave cabinet built . We 'd considered a built-in , but the cost differential is huge so we settled for the largest unit we could find to fit in the space . This unit has many pros , and a few cons : Pros : Huge , if you have the space , you can cook whatever you want . Powerful !! The inverter technology is amazing , you really can defrost a frozen piece of meat without cooking it even a bit . The push buttons are pretty intuitive . The popcorn settings are perfect ! Cons : It interferes with the WiFi when running at full strength . The sensor cooking settings are not good enough to trust . Of course I have read that this unit is prone to an early demise . Lets hope that is not the case for us . However , if you review all the microwaves you might consider buying , you will see that most are prone to breaking prematurely . Given the low price , high power , and huge size , this is a good buy . If it last 5 years , I will consider worth the price . If it breaks sooner , I will try to update here . And I will be dissapointed too ! 	Microwave
I purchased this microwave to use in the basement . I needed a small , basic model . This microwave is perfect for what I need . I had read in other reviews about the sticker on the front window . It is very hard to remove , but since I am not displaying the micro in the kitchen that did n't bother me . 	Microwave
I 've had this microwave for over a month now and it has been working without any problems . It is perfect for tight spaces . Has all the standard features that one would expect and power also seems adequate . Interior size is also large enough for most utensils . 	Microwave
I received this today and it looks great . I have n't actually used it yet , but , it did turn on : -RRB- -RRB- that 's always a plus . Hopefully this will be a good microwave . 	Microwave
My old Panasonic worked beautifully and hard for years . My new one works just as well and it arrived very quickly and in perfect condition . I was surprised and disappointed to see that even Panasonic products are now `` MADE IN CHINA '' . 	Microwave
Just received this microwave on Tuesday 10\/11\/11 . I purchased it from J&R as at the time Amazon said they has sales of it temporarily on hold . No big deal , only two dollars more , and also free shipping . First it arrived safe and sound , no dents or dings , very nicely finished after taking off the blue tinted protective plastic , which you must as it covers up the exhaust vent on the left side of the oven . Read tons of reviews on this oven before I decided to get it , some really bad but the majority of them positive , so here is my take . Firstly , I have only had it a day so can not speak to long term reliability . Fit and finish is first class , my oven did not have the door `` notch '' so often described in the reviews , so unable to comment on that as well . The time set knob , is OK , definitely different and will take a little getting used to , but if you read the descriptions of the over before you buy , you should already know about it . It works fine , if you are used to a keypad , you may or may not like it , this is something that is just personal preference . Personally I find it works good , I am not thrilled with it , but it does what it is supposed to so I certainly wo n't complain about it . I have used the power adjustment , the popcorn function , the defrost and the reheat function , as well as just entering in the time I wanted and start . Everything worked as advertised , the popcorn function said it was for a 3.6 oz bag , the one I cooked was 3.3 , and it left about 5 kernels unpopped , again nothing I ca n't live with . It is POWERFUL , I had a 1000w GE that decided to entertain me with a internal lightning storm , so it was a replacement . Like anything new you have to learn to adjust to the difference between what you had and what you have now , if you do , it works just fine . The front control panel is uncluttered and very functional , making it very easy to use . The light on the inside is just fine , it is as bright as any MW I have owned , it is just not quite as easy to see through the mesh on the door as other ovens , but you can certainly see what is going on inside . If it gives me 10 years of service like my last one , that is about $ 1 and five cents a month to own , certainly acceptable to me . It is big inside , and that is what I wanted as my last one was about 1\/3rd smaller , so the space will be welcome . I am giving it 5 stars based on fit , finish and function , only time will tell on the longevity . 	Microwave
This Sharp microwave is very good , however we were sent a black model instead of the white one we ordered . We picked this particular model because it shows a white microwave and thats what my wife wanted . After the initial disappointment we decided not to send it back , we wanted this particular microwave and did n't want to take a chance there would n't be one left . It is a very good product for the money . 	Microwave
I love this microwave . It 's a piece of art and looks great in the kitchen . The knob is very useful and so far it 's made microwaving fun ! The knob is turned to increase\/decrease cooking time and adjust the clock . It rotates very smoothly . There is a quick minute button available , but I find the knob more convenient . There are additional options such as sensor reheat , etc. . I have n't had the chance to use it these options yet . For price that you great , I 'd greatly recommend this microwave . One of the things that do n't bug me but seems to bug other people is that there is no light when you open the door . To me , this is fine , but I can see how that could be annoying to someone who wants to microwave in the dark ! 	Microwave
Really pleased with this microwave . We replaced this same unit which was 12 years old and still working but getting old . Love the full size oven and turntable . It will cook anything and we are very happy with this new model . 	Microwave
The microwave oven was received timely and well packaged . The oven was the perfect size . The product 's only problem was that the buttons must be pushed quite hard to operate and the set time must be higher to obtain optimum results . 	Microwave
This oven fits nicely on the counter , with space in front of the door . Being a larger size , it is helpful for reheating larger dishes from the freezer . We are very happy with it . The inside is easy to clean which is a large plus to me . 	Microwave
all rite product for the price , not great but 4 stars because of the price for the quality . does the job all rite 	Microwave
We bought this oven after our more expensive one died after the over l2 power outages and surges our electrical system went through during the recent hurricane . We did not want to spend a lot of money since we plan to redo our kitchen in the next few years , but we needed this oven to fit the built in space we already have . Happy with our purchase . It fit and is working quite nicely for us . Worth the price . 	Microwave
Very easy to use , It has great automatic features such food warm up . defrost . The large size allows defrosting whole turkeys , chickens briskets or multiple dishes at the same time . It is very powerful and quiet . 	Microwave
SUPER HAPPY WITH THIS MICROWAVE !!! COOKS VERY FAST BECAUSE IT 'S 12OO WATT . EASY TO USE AND SET TIME . ATRACTIVE . CAN GET IN WHITE OR BLACK . 	Microwave
I bought this microwave in April , and it went kaput tonight . The microwave suddenly went on BY ITSELF , then the keypad stopped working . Tried everything to get it working to no avail . I 'm angry about my time and money being wasted , so I hope this will warn off others from being duped-BEWARE ! 	Microwave
So after reading a few of the reviews , namely the one complaining about the microwave shaking the entire counter , I was a little skeptical about buying it because it is $ 120.00 and I do n't have money to waste . That being said , knowing how people tend to exaggerate and not being one to base a purchase on a negative review , I decided to buy it anyway . Boy , thank God I think for myself ! Firstly , this microwave was so dang quiet that I continuously kept walking back into the kitchen just to make sure the thing was on ! Not once has it rattled my counter or caused someone to come in from another room and ask about the raucous . Unless you live in a trailer or a tin can on a tin roof , I do not see how it is even possible for this thing to shake anything , it 's either a lie or a defective model . Secondly , it is a heavy microwave with a good solid door and not flimsy like you see with most `` nostalgic '' remakes of things that are shoddily thrown together with the cheapest materials imaginable . I like the blue LED digital clock on the microwave as well . To note , it is not as large inside as previous microwaves I have had , however it does fit a whole chicken and has worked with everything I have put into it . This was a great investment and an excellent buy , if you 're thinking about getting one I say go for it as the quality is really good and the character it adds to your kitchen simply can not be beat .

Had a GE SpaceMaker unit that lasted for 20 years . My young son finally decided to `` cook '' , as in REALLY cook , some food -- unbeknownst to his parents -- and started a little bonfire inside it . So we gave that trusty ole friend a proper funeral , then replaced it with this Panasonic unit . We selected the NN-SD997S for its good looks , power , capacity , and decent reviews . Alas ... it lasted only 'til just after the warranty expired , then it gave up the ghost with some impressive fireworks when merely trying to pop a single-portion bag of microwave popcorn . Planned obsolescence ? You tell me . All I know is that they do n't make 'em like they used to . Look elsewhere , there is enough anecdotal evidence in this collection of reviews to suggest it prudent to do so . 	Microwave
Two days before Thanksgiving 2009 my 18 year old microwave died . It was a large Tappan that had given excellent service . My first thought was to check out Consumer Reports for their recommendations . Then I checked out the reviews and found that virtually none of the ones that CR recommended garnered good reviews by purchasers . This was rather disconcerting . So I decided to simply go for an oven that got good reviews on Amazon and would fit my budget . This one got 13 5-star and 3 4-star reviews . It is quite roomy and has several features that I have not even used yet but I have found the defrost feature to work very well . It cooks frozen entrees and reheats food more quickly than my old unit which had a higher wattage . I have not tried cooking popcorn , so ca n't speak to that . In a similar Sharp model , several people mentioned the loud opening and closing of the door . That simply does not bother me . To me it just makes the product have a `` solid '' feel , similar to a good door slam on a new car . It has a plastic door which should not deter a potential buyer . My old Tappan had one too and I never even knew it until I checked it out when I was doing this research . I got this unit for an excellent price from Amazon and have been completely satisfied with it . I use it everyday and would recommend it highly . 	Microwave
kids love to use it wife does too . Works under bar . it is a perfect space saver . hard to break ! Love it . 	Microwave
I purchased this microwave from Warehousedeals in October of 2010 , and sparks were flying out the back of it by April 2011 . It 's too late for a return ; this is a frightening experience , and I will not purchase any electical item of any sort from Warehousedeals again . I do n't know how this unit made it through quality control . If you need a micro with some power , keep looking . 	Microwave
Bought a Sharp Microwave Drawer one and a half years ago . Barely used it - warming leftovers once a week and softening butter a few times . Started to make funny noises and gave off an electrical smell . Because I bought it from an American Supplier - Sharp Canada is saying I have no warranty and suggest that I send the microwave to a family member in the US to have it repaired . This is ludicrous . Sharp US says I have to deal with Sharp Canada . To get it repaired here it will cost $ 286 . Either way it will cost a small fortune to repair . 	Microwave
My Panasonic Microwave died after 6 years of steady use . I usually reward brands that hold up like that . However , this time I went with Consumer Reports guidance . Price was not an issue , I just wanted a very good Microwave . It was rated highly so I went with it . My first gut instinct upon actually using this one was I should have stuck w \/ Panasonic . But anyways : PROS : \* Has plenty of features . \* The interior light is a nice touch . \* Opens by a handle , not a push button . Mechanical simplicity there , which sometimes is a good thing . \* Very strong power . Cooks or re-heats in a snap . \* Quick touch sensor , used for , say , Popcorn , Frozen Entrees , etc. . Cooks said items a bit more accurately than many other Microwaves I have used . -LRB- not perfect , but close -RRB- . CONS : \* It feels cheaply made , and I do n't predict a long usable life for this product . I may be wrong , hope I am , but initial impression is that this one is not built to last . \* Slides around the counter to the point you worry it will fall on the floor when you open the door . And the door shuts with an amazingly cheap plastic on plastic sound . I put rubber type shelf liner under it to help eliminate worries that both Microwave and whats inside of will crash to the floor when it is opened . The cheap plastic door ... well , you ca n't do much about that . \* It is fairly noisy . And using the quick touch sensor causes the power to surge up and down in an alarming fashion : It sounds like it is working very hard , and ready to break at any moment . Bottom Line : My last Microwave lasted 6 years . I do n't predict this one lasting more than 6 months . I could be wrong , and will update this review accordingly . But for now , it works pretty good . 	Microwave
For the first 1.5 yrs of owning this microwave , I was in love . It heats evenly , it 's fast , it 's easy to use and it can fit quite a bit in the interior . The door latch started sticking around 8 mos in , but I could deal with that . Just a minor inconvenience . Then a few weeks ago , it would suddenly stop heating in the middle of a cycle . Just shut down . So we took it in to an authorized Panasonic repair shop , who found a bad inverter and some other parts . Essentially , every major component that runs the microwave failed ! Since it was out of the 1 year warranty , Panasonic would only cover $ 85 in inverter parts . The remaining repair with labor would be $ 95 - over half of what I paid for it just over a year earlier ! The shop is apparently seeing a lot of the Panasonic NN models , which is a shame . I really like this microwave , and I did n't abuse it . We might have used it 2-3x a day to reheat food and that 's all . We had had a Sharp microwave prior to this and it lasted 11 years . We only replaced it to get a larger microwave , it never had an issue . Now the newer Sharps seem to be prone to fires . I 've got a GE on order now , hopefully we 'll have better luck . We gave the Panasonic to the repair shop , it 'll make a really pretty doorstop . Bottom line - I 'd find another manufacturer until Panasonic addresses this issue . Microwaves should last a lot longer than 1.5 years . 	Microwave
A big Microwave - which was what I was lookinig for . Teh construction is good and the quality seems excellent so far . It is a bit louder than what I had thought it would be . However , the features are great - just be sure to adjust your cooking time as the power is higher than what you maybe used to . 	Microwave
I bought this microwave to replace a larger 800 watt one that finally gave out on me . I wondered about the lower wattage on this one , but the things I have put in it so far have come out hot . A few people said it takes longer for food to heat , but maybe I am automatically adjusting for that , knowing that the wattage is lower . This one is also smaller than the other one -LRB- .7 cu . ft. as compared to .8 cu . ft. -RRB- and I was amazed at the difference in size , so that came as a pleasant surprise to me , having more counter space to work with now . A few people mentioned about pushing the buttons and opening the door , but the effort on this one is about the same as on the other one I had , so I did n't even consider that . All in all , this suits my purposes well ; smaller size , brighter -LRB- compared to the my old black one -RRB- and heating and cooking things in it have been satisfactory . 	Microwave
I looked on several sites and stores for a microwave for our office . Some of the reviews made me a little skeptical , but I took a chance and we love it ! Some people in their review complained about the loudness of the microwave , well I work in an office where we have one person out of 6 that did n't want the microwave and pushed hard for us not to get it , and if she has n't complained about the noise , then that tells me that this product was a good choice\/purchase . Thanks ! RCA RMW953 0.9-Cubic Feet Microwave Oven With Oversized Display , black 	Microwave
Replaced a 23 year old Panasonic microwave that was still working -LRB- never repaired -RRB- , but was getting tired . This unit was installed in a cabinet using the old trim -LRB- with a small alteration needed -RRB- . Sensor cooking feature is great . It takes the mystery out of how long or at what power to set the microwave . When timed cooking is used we had to modify our old times , as this one is much quicker . The inverter really works . Power levels are actually less on the lower settings not just on-off cycling . The inside capacity on this microwave is much larger than our old one even though the outside width is the same . When a 9 '' x 13 '' casserole dish goes around without touching , you know you have a large cavity . The outside is easy to maintain . Fingerprints do n't show easily , but if they do a swipe with a damp cloth cleans them off . An earlier review mentioned receiving a couple of shipments with a chip on the trim of the microwave . My microwave had a `` nick '' in the same position . Closer examination of the `` nick '' showed it to be a machined removal of the trim by the manufacturer that was supposed to be there . I think Panasonic has built another excellent microwave . 	Microwave
I had doubts after reading the mixed reviews ; however , this little charmer is perfect !! A little rattling at first until I pressed in the casing and voila ! Perfectly silent and cute to boot . You ca n't go wrong with this microwave ! Heats well , and can fit full sized caserole dish inside with the glass turntable . 	Microwave
Having further researched the Panasonic inverter type microwaves , I bought this one from Amazon after returning 2 lesser -LRB- and unused -RRB- Panasonic microwaves which I had purchased locally . After three months of use , we are happy with the ease of use and performance of this 2.2 cu ft -LRB- i.e. , large -RRB- 1250 watt oven . So far , so good . I actually ENJOY using it with its rotary dial control -LRB- only a few buttons -RRB- , blue lighting prompts , very bright and easy to see blue digital display and real stainless steel -LRB- easy to clean -RRB- case . Heartily recommended . 	Microwave
I purchased this oven based on the reviews , big mistake . This oven might nuke just fine but it is really cheap looking ! There is plastic chrome type all over it declaring it 's retro credentials , how could it be retro when there were no microwaves in this supposed time zone , think Sputnik . I will keep this short if you like cheap tacky looking things , you are going to love this product . If you do not stay far , far , another galaxy away from this . 	Microwave
When this product arrived , the box looked terribly beat up , torn , scuffed , taped together . The microwave inside was dented . When I contacted the company , they did not respond until I filed a claim with Amazon . They eventually asked me to send the item back and refunded my money . 	Microwave
So obviously this review is not based on the durability of the item , which is the most important factor , but that being said , I doubt there is an inherent defect with the product that it 'll die within the first year of operation . I 've read the negative reviews about some of these arriving DOA , but I think we all have heard horror stories of products that are defective from day one , be it Sony TVs or Honda cars , etc. . Assuming every manufacture has it 's share of lemons and the vast majority are in good working condition , and you happen to get a good one , then you will get a microwave that is so simple to use , looks very modern and heats as well as any other microwave . You basically have to turn a dial to set the time and hit `` start '' to begin microwaving . So easy , even my parents can use it . 	Microwave
The good : really large ; this will take a large pizza and easily turn ; it will even take a full size casserole dish -LRB- 13X9 -RRB- . Very light weight because of the Inverter technology so it is easy to move . The inverter , as I understand it , operates the oven at the level you request verses non-inverters which run 100 % power in spirts to produce the same amount of cooking over time . Easy to use programing . The bad ; the inverter does n't seem to have much of a life span and when it goes it costs too much to replace ; you pretty much have to buy a new oven . And it does interfere with wireless phones . We ca n't have them on simultaneously . Gave this a 4 overall because when our inverter burned up -LRB- literally -RRB- we bought another one because of the size , lightness and speed . 	Microwave
This is a wonderful microwave ! I love `` everything '' about it ! It is quiet , good looking , and easy to use . This is the first time I 've had one with a knob instead of a keypad , and I really like the knob better ! It is now December 28 , 2010 , and I have been using this microwave for quite awhile . I have discovered an indispensable feature called `` Sensor Reheat '' . I can put a whole plate of different kinds of food in the microwave on this setting , and it all comes out great ! I can take a frozen product that has all kinds of special instructions , ignore the special instructions , and use sensor reheat , and it turns out great ! I love this microwave , and I especially love `` Sensor Reheat '' ! 	Microwave
it 's actually larger that I expected . I spent about 2 hours reading reviews for the cheapest Microwave with the best ratings . Best bang for your buck 	Microwave
I needed a small microwave and this fit the bill . Works well but feels cheap . Door is poorly constructed . Works well enough but would not be my first choice if I did not live in a very old bldg with poor electric 	Microwave
This stainless micro looks good in any kitchen . Tho not as easy to use as our previous oven , it has a digital readout for many items you might want to cook . I like the senso cooking and sensor reheat feature . When not sure how long a particular food will take to cook , the sensors determine when cooking is complete , and so far it has been right on . I 'm not used to a 1250 watt micro and have cooked oatmeal to the point of over flow several times . Nice part about it the oven is easy to clean and keep clean . The rotating wheel and plate are easily removed to clean around . 	Microwave
I have made the mistake of buying two GE space saver microwaves for my two homes . Both have badly peeling paint not only inside the door but on the back wall of the microwave as well . Got same answer form GE . `` buy the paint and paint it myself '' . Did buy the paint but by then the rust was too extensive to nake it work . I am also looking for a nice microwave about the same size and features ! 	Microwave
I 'm disappointed in the grill feature on this appliance . The microwave works well . I like the brushed steel . The convection oven also works well but not always - this could be my error though . I tried to grill a boneless , skinless chicken breast . The user guide told me to pre-heat the grill rack that comes with this appliance , which is what I did . It was horrid . I may as well have poached the chicken breast . It was delivered by Chefs Catalog where I have purchased things over the years and have never had a problem with them as far as delivery , etc. . I purchased a set of LeCrueset cookware years ago and they still honored the lifetime guaranty without question . I would NEVER purchase anything made by Cuisinart again - I 'm not going to go through the story of my Cuisinart food processor . 	Microwave
Great idea I went out and got frozen french fries . Tried no preheat convection and after 15 minutes they were n't done and cooked another 5 minutes . Another batch I went with preheat and the temp at 425 as suggested and put the fries in the oven at the start of the preheat cycle . By the time it hit 425 the fries were done . I never did set the time . You are not allowed to set the time before the temp preheat is reached . At that rate if they are not quite done then you add more time through what they call kitchen time . there 's heat exhausting out the back that I wish would stay in the oven heating it up faster . However I do n't know how convection ovens heat themselves . Tried the idea of turning on the grill for 2 minutes then going to convection . It did not seem to speed things up any . I am not unhappy . I 've gotten three appliances off my counter and put the Cuisinart on top of the stove . Heat is an issue in the southwest so I have never used my gas pilot stove . The microwave works exactly as I expected . The grill has three settings . 100 % grilling , 30 % micro plus 70 % grill , and 55 % micro plus 45 % grill . I have n't enjoyed steak at home for years so this I am really looking forward to . Fishsticks I 'm going to try 30\/70 . Roasting and baking have a fast setting which combines micro and convection , you can go straight convection too . I would buy it again because the price is right , it microwaves great and grills . I never was an oven baker so few times I may preheat convection will be very seldom . Right now I 'm going to look for a rack utensil that I can use in both oven and microwave . I 'm sure after a learning curve that I will be preheat convection cooking and adding minutes after the oven acquires the set temp to finish my cooking . Everything is possible . 	Microwave
We bought this to use in our vintage camper this summer . When we received it earlier in the year we used it in the house as a test period and it has worked perfectly . It is quiet and does everything it should . At this time we are very pleased . Please remember that this is not our everyday workhorse so we can not attest to its quality under such circumstances . 	Microwave
It 's a nice looking microwave but it barely fit a dinner place . I also do n't like the turntable . When removing a dinner plate the turntable rocked on the cheep bracket and it felt like it was going to fall out and crash on the counter . By far my biggest complaint was the sticker on the door . They used some sort of atomic glue to adhere it making it almost impossible to remove . For the life of me I ca n't understand why on earth they would use such strong glue . Good luck getting it off with out scratching the plastic window . I ended up returning it because of the poor design . 	Microwave
I am so pleased with my purchase of the Panasonic Microwave Oven . I have purchased just about every brand , and been so disappointed with the performance . This Panasonic is so easy to use , and cooks food perfectly . The design is very attractive , and sturdy . Panasonic sure makes good products . Because of two other Panasonic products I have purchased Years ago , and they are still going strong , I had high hopes for this microwave , and it has far surpassed my expectations . One of my favorite features , I might add is the large printing in the instruction area making it so easy to read . Thank you Panasonic , and keep up the good work . Thanks also to Amazon for offering wonderful products , and making them affordable . I always find just what I 'm looking for at Amazon , and have never had to return , nor been disappointed with any purchase , so needless to say , I shop Amazon a lot . 	Microwave
It died quickly with error `` H98 '' for which one must contact the manufacturer . I have always had good luck with Panasonic products before so I 'm very disappointed . 	Microwave
It gets the job done ! Perfect for any college student looking to save some bucks ... Actually , better then I have expected ! 	Microwave
It worked great for 2 years and then stopped working . I 'm tempted to buy the same model again though because it heated food fast . A full size bag of microwave popcorn only needed 1 min 45 secs . You ca n't beat the price for such a big microwave , if you do n't mind replacing it every 2 years . 	Microwave
I purchased this item as a gift for my Son and as of yet , I have n't had any negatives , so I take it , he 's happy with it ... ... . 	Microwave
The microwave did not work upon receipt . The only good thing was that Amazon was very quick to refund our money . 	Microwave
Microwave is fine but needs a light on control side since it is so dark and you ca n't read it . Otherwise it has enough wattage \/ I would not use the touch control since I do n't use enough of those products . 	Microwave
With a loud pop , a dramatic spark and an immediate smell of smoke , our 10-year old microwave went out with a literal bang . I quickly jumped on Amazon and began searching for a replacement . I had hoped that it would be a relatively easy task ; all I needed was a microwave with a $ 100 price tag and some great reviews . What I found was microwave after microwave with reviews all over the place , regardless of the cost . For every good review , I found a bad one . It seemed an impossible task . Finally , I decided to just dive in and pick one . I went with this microwave because I trust the brand and after that I just hoped for the best . When the microwave arrived a few days later I nervously opened the box . First off , I loved how it looked . Nice and white , clean finish and such a great size . Then I needed to actually see how it worked . It is amazing . I thought our last microwave was good but this guy cooks everything in half the time . I also love how quiet it is . The actual cooking process is done at a nice , reasonable volume and the beeping -LRB- whether setting the timer or when the timer expires -RRB- is a calm , subtle beep . And lastly , it has a one minute button that is great for instant heating . It 's a wonderful appliance that I highly recommend and I am so happy with my purchase . 	Microwave
This Panasonic product started out good but quickly degraded into a product that needs serious production review . A month and a half after purchase the interior cabinet light started to flicker when the door was opened . Today , less than two and one half months after purchase , the unit is now at an authorized Panasonic repair center due to the fact that when the unit is started it trips which ever 15A or 20A circuit to which it is attached . 	Microwave
i had this microwave for a week before it broke . really disappointed . beautiful to look at & now i have a $ 100 paperweight in my kitchen 	Microwave
I bought this for my new kitchen renovation . I was getting rid of the huge vent above the stove and wanted a nice place for a microwave that would vent . You can use it to vent up and out , or it can recycle the air and let it flow back in the room . I 'm using it for the latter . The fan is very loud , I find , but not so bad that I would n't use it . The microwave is nice and has a lot of nice features on it like quick start -LRB- also known as Add 30 Seconds -RRB- . I would recommend it . You probably wo n't find a better one for a price like this . 	Microwave
Bought 2 . One for sons dorm room and one for my wifes store , both work well . Not a full powered oven but great for the price and powerful enough . 	Microwave
I replaced a Kenmore over twenty five years old with this microwave . The Kenmore was working fine but could not get a replace bulb for it . Started doing on line research and of the ones with the capibility this one has picked this one . It is very powerful at 1250 watts . 2.2 c. feet is also very large . Only had it a month but so far does everything it was said to do . Have not run into any router problems that some said they were having with wireless phone or computer . 	Microwave
This is a nice , small microwave . It has many of the features you 'd find on larger ones . It 's quiet and when your food is done , it beeps 3 times . That 's it . No annoying tones or long beeps afterward like some others . 	Microwave
I love this microwave ... its just perfect in all ways . The color is incredible . If anyone is considering this product buy it you wo n't be let down ... 	Microwave
Pros : small footprint but large enough to put a plate inside . Feels more industrial and would stand up to a family . Cons : the controls are require more pressure to operate . It 's also true what the others are saying about the visibility of the clock . Because of this the microwave is constantly being pushed backwards . I think this appliance would be better all around if the location was at eye level instead of on a counter , but my small kitchen lacks a high shelf . I have had the microwave for about 3 months and yesterday while making popcorn the glass tray cracked into 3 large pieces . I replaced with a plate so that we could continue to use it while I shopped for a replacement -LRB- $ 30 -RRB- and that plate cracked I hope this is not a trend ... ?! 	Microwave
I live all the way in the middle of Bush Alaska , and with free shipping on this microwave this was an excellent price and works perfectly ! The only downside is that it does n't heat things as fast as bigger microwaves , but that immediately turns into a positive because it 's much lighter and the difference in heating speed is n't that much . Great bargain on this one ! 	Microwave
My shipment came promptly . This was a replacement for a RIP microwave and is wonderful . Same outside dimensions , but the inside is much larger . We also noticed it was much lighter in weight . Very pleased . 	Microwave
Yep , Stopped heating after 2 years of light use . Magnetron costs about as much as a new unit , so I 'm scared of what GE Service would cost to come replace it . Pass on G.E. and related brands . You 're looking for disappointment if you chose G.E. brand midsized microwave ovens . My Advice : Head to your local flea-market or second-hand shop and buy yourself a reliable microwave made in the early 90 's , here in the USA . It wo n't match , but you can always paint that beige a stainless-steel color : -RRB- 	Microwave
I would n't recommend this microwave . It fried after 9 months , that 'd be fine if it were a lemon and covered under some kind of warranty but , sadly , no warranty . Going big or going home next time . 	Microwave

I 've been a fan of Nostalgia Electrics since I first saw some of their products at BJ 's . They were n't this beautiful shade of red , though . More of a '50s looking aqua color . I was in love . I had wanted it for so long . Then , I finally decided to makeover my kitchen and give it that '50s diner theme to it . This microwave is the cherry on top ! It 's SO beautiful . It just SCREAMS retro ! Not only that , it 's SO quiet ! Perfect for that midnight snack when you have a sleeping baby close by . My husband actually came over to get me asking if it was normal that it was so quiet ! Ahahaha . This microwave is great . It 's my favorite ! : -RRB- 	Microwave
I received this microwave today . It is not new ; has dents , scratches , does not even look new and no new smell . To top that off you can see where the glass plate was wiped clean and residue left . I 'm so disappointed with this order . I ca n't tell you if it 's a good product or not because I did n't receive one . 	Microwave
I purchased this Microwave in November ... in June it stopped working ... completely . Seven months . This microwave weights about 45 pounds and was shipped TO MY DOOR -LRB- yes , it 's that heavy and bulky -RRB- with so much padding that it does n't crush under its own heavy weight during shipment . But when it breaks -- AND IT WILL BREAK -- Panasonic will NOT do anything to provide in home service . NOTHING . If you are unable as I am to lift that much weight and bring it yourself to a place THEY designate to get it repaired you are out of luck . You do n't have to take my word for it -- just do an internet search for Panasonic Microwave broken or Panasonic Microwave H98 and see how many thousands of hits you get . Once upon a time Panasonic used to stand for quality . NOTE TO PANASONIC : THE REPAIR PROCESS BEGINS WITH GETTING THE DEFECTIVE UNIT MANUFACTURED BY YOU TO THE PLACE WHERE IT CAN BE REPAIRED , OR GETTING THE TECHNICIAN WHO CAN PERFORM THE REPAIR TO THE LOCATION OF THE DEFECTIVE PRODUCT . SHAME ! SHAME ! SHAME ! 	Microwave
I replace my old microwave oven , made by panasonic -LRB- Quasar -RRB- then the top of the line 600 watts , did not have single problem for 26 years . We replace it for energy efficiency and the invertor technology , easy intuitive controls and during the first month , my wife has not found a problem to complain about -LRB- yeah ! -RRB- the unit is slightly smaller that the old one . I will highly recommend this unit . I would like to write a review after one year of use . 	Microwave
I received this today , unpacked it , removed ALL the plastic film , assembled the turntable , plugged it in , placed a cup of cold water in it and pushed start . It roared , like a jackhammer . The light was on , the turntable grinded away , and it produced no heat . I called LG . The guy in customer service said , `` What did you do , turn on a motorcycle ? '' It is now repacked and I am waiting for UPS to come and take it away . The microwave arrived in a beat up old box with minimal packing materials and no invoice . eBay would have been ashamed . The key pad is dark , with small numbers and therefore difficult to see . The display is only half readable until you meet it at eye level . It is a tinny oven and does n't look or feel well made . I read the reviews , knew it could be a problem , but foolishly was seduced by the soften , melt feature . So I am returning to good old Panasonic , and buyer beware . 	Microwave
All in all the Panasonic Genius Prestige Microwave is one of the better units out there . That said there is a learning curve and you have to get used to using it as the directions say . We moved from a Sharp convection\/microwave with a touch pad and moving the Panasonic takes some adapting . The hard part is getting used to hitting the correct button and then using the dial . There is a patience factor involved as you wait for the words to scroll across the lcd so you know what you are doing . But once the right item appears and you hit start the microwave cooks the food well . We mainly use the unit to reheat leftovers and prepare fresh vegetables . The fresh vegetable setting -LRB- 9 on the dial -RRB- is pretty accurate . Items are hot but not overcooked with browned edges . Reheating food using the reheat button gets the food hot but I generally hit the food with an extra minute before eating . THis may just be a habit leftover from the old Sharp . As far as vendors go - I bought the unit from American TV & Appliance after they price matched Amazon with a debate on if Amazon was going to charge S&H or tax -LRB- which they do n't -RRB- . My wife coulnd wait for delivery so we bought it there . Then I found the unit as Sams Club for $ 100.01 and AMerican is hemming and hawing about a new price match . If they do n't I will buy a couple more and make them price match before I leave the store . My advice is to stick with a vendor that you know will honor what they say about returns and price matches . 	Microwave
This item was purchased because it was small and would fit nicely in a small apartment . I 've returned it twice and will not buy anything with the name Haier again . When we first received this item it was dented and was uneven on the counters due to the dent , we then sent it back for a new one . The replacement microwave we received stopped working only weeks after getting it and it now being returned again . Maybe it was just bad luck for us with this item but I do not suggest buying it . 	Microwave
From the day we took this out of the box and plugged it in , we have had no end of problems . First , after cooking something , it would ding and then shut itself down . It ran so hot that the metal cover was almost too hot to touch . Intermitantly , the turntable would not work and made a horrible noise . The worst was the smell ! It smelled of burning varnish so bad , that we had to open all the windows , doors and run our professional grade exhaust fan . While the problem with it shutting itself seemed to resolve itself after a couple of weeks -LRB- hmm ... needs a break in period ? -RRB- . The smell has never gone completely away , but now it takes 4 minutes , not just two to start smelling . Took it to an authorized GE Appliance repair place who first told me there was no problem with it after completing their bench test and said it was good to go home . I laughed and asked that they PLEASE run it for four minutes . Well , that changed things and they just called me today to indicate that GE stated it was not repairable and now I will need to deal with GE . But I guess I should be grateful because the paint was not peeling ! Lets see what kind of customer service I get from GE . 	Microwave
Microwave is very spacious ; works well and is very powerful ... We love this unit . . Arrived with faulty circuit card ; would not heat up . Sharp Warranty personnel were here within 2 days and fixed it . 	Microwave

We got this about 4-5 months ago and it is very good . Heats evenly and quickly and it is HUGE ! You can actually put a 9x13 glass pan in it and it will rotate without even bumping the walls . Fits the hole above the oven well , and other than the door latch being too loud -LRB- and nothing you can do about it -RRB- , we have no complaints . 	Microwave
this item works as a micro wave but not as a convection oven & grill i would not want any one to buy this item 	Microwave
ours is still working after a year but you got to be careful because sometimes the cooling fan dont run when the magnetron is turned on and it will just hum . which can cause overheating and fire . its loud as heck and the light bearly gives enough light for a nightlite . flimsy stainless steel front and the rack always sparks against the sidewall . 	Microwave
This is a very nice unit . I needed a 2.2 cu . ft. microwave to fit in the space left by my old one . My only reservation is that the plastic covering of the control panel has already shown some bubbling . My old Kenmore microwave lasted over 15 years without a hint of bubbling . This unit is much more powerful however , and the reduced heating time is welcome . 	Microwave
My wife and I decided to replace our old Sharp Carousel microwafe oven . The new Panasonic NN-SD767S was shipped quickly by Amazon.com . The instruction manual was easy to read and the different directions easy to follow . After having this microwave oven for a few weeks and tried the various functions I figured it was time to rate this microwave oven . One of the most impressive on the use of this microwave is its low noise compared to our old microwave . Not only during the operation but also the warning tone or beeps when the cooking is complete . This microwave has the high wattage of 1250 watts for fast cooking . Another of the great features is the Sensor Reheat feature and the Sensor Cook feature which is used without setting time . This microwave sensors the steam and therefore determines the cooking time . We find that the food is about right as far as the temperature when the cooking is done . My wife and I are quite impressed with this microwave oven . 	Microwave
Yeah yeah , the interior light doesnt come on unless the microwave is in use . WE GET IT . This holds true for a lot of Panasonic models . But I have found a truly groundbreaking solution . My team of researchers have discovered , through rigorous trial and error , that using a secondary light source such the light in your kitchen , can work equally as well ! I know navigating that 1.2 cubic feet of space can be treacherous . Many times have my hands wandered the interior searching for those elusive fish sticks . It wasnt until I flicked that mystery switch on the wall that I discovered the glorious light that was emitted from the ceiling . It was like staring into the sun ! If you happen to live in a black hole or the Mariana Trench , Amazon sells a wonderful assortment of flashlights . Other than the insurmountable flaw listed above , the microwave works fine . The selector knob is kind of gimmicky but works . I can not comment on the longevity of the unit , but there have been no issues so far . The ONLY thing I dont like is that the stainless steel front panel is a fingerprint magnet . 	Microwave
I bought this item after doing a lot of research and physically shopping through all the appliance stores to test out different models in person . It was one of the nicest looking microwaves with plenty of interior room and great functionality . I had read reviews that the `` plastic handle '' over-the-range microwaves had problems with breaking and cracking from heat exposure over time , so one of the features I wanted was the durable stainless steel handle . It has tons of functionality , including dual option lighting , 3 fan speeds -LRB- the lower fan speeds are more quite than the previous whirlpool we were replacing -RRB- , 12 one-touch sensor cook options on the keypad -LRB- including a soften feature that many models do not have -RRB- . I almost got scared off by all the `` SE problems '' described in a lot of the reviews . Then I realized that all of them said the problem started within 1-2 years -LRB- just after the 1-year manufacturer warranty expired -RRB- . So I got smart and purchased the item at Sears at a great sale price and paid $ 40 for a 3-Year In-Home fully covered warranty . I almost `` never '' purchase warranties on any of my appliances ... but now I have the microwave that I love , along with the peace of mind : -RRB- I also have the option to extend that warranty if I choose to after the first 3 years . I am very pleased with this purchase decision . 	Microwave
This is a great small microwave . It fits in a small area . Replaces an existing . This works much better . Do recommend 	Microwave
I really looked forward to using this microwave . Unfortunately , it was n't until I reached page 6 of the instruction booklet that I found I could not use it due to space requirements . The oven needs at least 3 inches free space at sides and back , as well as 12 inches free space above it . These requirements should be listed along with the size of the oven in the technical info to avoid a customer having to send the item back . My hanging wall cupboards were too for me to use the oven , so it had to go back . 	Microwave
We have a small apartment with limited counter space , so we needed a compact microwave . I did my research , read a ton of reviews , sorted by customer feedback , etc. . This microwave seemed like a good buy . Before buying I was concerned because I love to pop popcorn , especially munching with the hubby , family , friends and getting together on movie night . In my mind this was the deal breaker ... The microwave was actually great . It heated up any food just fine . Regular large ROUND dinner plates fit fine . Regular large SQUARE dinner plates will not rotate . Just letting you know if you have the square styled plates , you can only use the medium sized ones in this microwave . To me , I was okay with that . Fine , I 'll just use the medium square plates as long as the microwave cooks fine I 'm okay . So then came the ultimate test . I just placed any regular sized popcorn bag in there from the grocery store -LRB- actually I tried two different very popular brands of the regular size -RRB- . The bags did not and could not rotate because the microwave was too compact that it did n't give any room . This scorched the bag because it touched the top and side of the microwave and some of the popcorn popped and some were burnt . I tried to take it out early , but then I 'd only have half a bag of popped popcorn each time . That 's wasting money . So yeah , I was disappointed . Tried again a few more times to experiment -LRB- because I DID like the microwave and was willing to work with it -RRB- but it really burned the bag and contents . I COULD get the mini popcorn bags , but then that would take longer as I 'd have to pop multiple bags . Then I thought , why would I have to conform to the microwave ?? If you do not like to eat popcorn at all , by all means get this microwave . It is cute , compact and heats up food just fine . If you want your popcorn for movie night or whatever , find something else . I ended up buying the `` Sharp R-230KW 800-Watt 4\/5-Cubic-Foot Compact Microwave '' from Amazon too and now I am happy . It 's like the Sanyo but a bit bigger -LRB- I think an inch extra which was all that the Sanyo needed ! -RRB- and better so that food and POPCORN can properly rotate and cook . I feel the Sharp is the ultimate compact microwave that does n't cost an arm and a leg , and the Sanyo ... ehh not so much . As I think of it , I did n't have the Sanyo long enough to experiment with other packed foods and food containers , so there could be some shortcomings there too . Also kudos to Amazon customer service , because I explained my situation and I was able to return this item and get a refund without a problem . If could rate them separately it would be 5 stars . So , if you have your heart set on this microwave for whatever reason , maybe you could do a `` test drive '' too , just double check the return policy . 	Microwave
I was looking for a very large microwave to fit a certain space in my kitchen . I found this microwave and it was the exact measurements I needed . I also wanted all black which is getting hard to find . It has great features and the best of all , a great price . 	Microwave
I recently decided to start running again , and was quite curious about the course i was running which seemed tough . In particular , I 'm training in the hills and wanted to know how far I 'm running and the elevation changes . This watch is really great for that . I know can see my heart rate , how it is impacted by grade , and how far up and down i 'm going . I can see that my heart rate jumps as I hit 25 % grades , and my pace slows to a crawl . But I feel much less guilty about it ... I was worried that this watch would be enormous on me . I have a very small wrist , at 15cm , and most watches are too big . I also hate clunky things . Although this watch is definitely much larger than i would wear normally , it is actually reasonably comfortable and does not bother me or awkwardly hit wrist bones , so i was pleased about that . I 've become quite addicted to running with it , because for one thing it removes fear of unknown courses . I always have a good idea how far I 've traveled , so I do n't worry so much about going out too far . I also like seeing progress , since with the software I can see how I 'm doing if I repeat a course , whether my heart rate or pace are dropping and so forth . And , when running , I like being able to check on my pace and distance so i can judge them better . The software that comes with it is so so . Maybe it has some great features but they are n't immediately intuitive , but the online software on motionbased is really cool . I like being able to share my courses with friends and see a map of where i 've gone and track progress . On vista64 it will complain a bunch when you install the drivers , but it eventually figures things out and works . I 'm sure the watch has a million features I have n't touched yet . I 'm just using it with the simplest set up , but so far I really like the thing , and it definitely helps inspire me to keep training . 	Monitor
Garmin works great . Have n't tried the HRM . Good tool to improve your speed or distance . 	Monitor
I have never heard of this company before . I did a search and could not find their website or any other vendors who carry this item . 	Monitor
I purchased this GPS watch as a replacement for my Garmin 205 -LRB- which replaced my 201 -RRB- . While the design is basically the same , it adds a heart rate monitor -LRB- and extra cost -RRB- . The 305 provides a wide range of features that are specified in the product description , so I will not recap them here . Rather , I will focus on the positive and negative features of the device . On the positive side , the GPS is considerably improved from earlier models . It can even acquire a satellite lock inside my house , through the skylights or even through a glass door . While running , it has been able to keep the lock even under trees-with a few exceptions involving thicker forest . I run mainly on wooded trails and it works quite well under those conditions . The GPS is also quite accurate-I 've tested it against certified courses and it has been dead on . I was never one to use a heart rate monitor before , but I decided to go with the 305 because it was only slightly more than the 205 -LRB- at least when I was buying -RRB- and I had been informed that training with a HRM can be beneficial . The HRM works well-that is , it seems to report the HR correctly . Naturally , it still uses the chest strap -LRB- so , you 'll look like you are wearing a bikini top or bra from the back if you run shirtless -RRB- . The strap battery is a standard type and can easily be replaced by the user . The strap comes with the 305-at least the version I bought . Because it has a receiver for the HRM , it can also connect to other accessories , such as the Garmin footpod . I do n't have that since I always train outside . The device also connects to your PC via a USB cable and uploads -LRB- or downloads -RRB- data . The included software is adequate , but you can also use third party software such as Sports Tracks . While I am not a super data sort of person , I do find it interesting to have information about my running available , most especially races . The device has a rechargeable battery that can not be replaced by the user and recharges from a cradle . The cradle can plug into an outlet or a USB port . I 've found that the battery life is as advertised and recharge rates are reasonably quick . On the minus side , the device is not waterproof-you can get it wet , but swimming with it would be a bad idea . Garmin does have a newer model that is properly waterproof , so if you are doing triathlons or swimming , do n't get the 305 . The device is also fairly bulky relative to sports watches , although this does allow for a large screen that can easily display four data fields . I have no problem running with it and do not really notice the weight difference-but I have been wearing a GPS watch while running for a few years now . The controls are okay -LRB- that is , usable but not great -RRB- , but be sure to only push the side -LRB- rubbery -RRB- buttons with your fingertips rather than using your nail . If you use your nail , you 'll eventually wear down the buttons . I did have some locking up problems with my 205 , but none yet with my 305 . Of course , I 've only had it a while . Overall , if you are looking for a GPS watch and HRM , this is a good product . I got mine for an excellent price here at Amazon , so look for a deal . 	Monitor
I love this Garmin . My first GPS watch and it is great . It is great for running and biking ! 	Monitor
I bought this for my husband for his birthday . He loves it ! 	Monitor
SEE THE TLDR BELOW IF YOU DO N'T WANT TO READ IT ALL I bought this a month ago , absolutely no problems with it . Great picture quality ! Built in speakers are adequate , as long as you are n't expecting too much from them . Button LED 's are very dim , but still easy to see in a well lighted room . Remote makes changing settings easy and fast . As a computer monitor this is a good buy , but if you are looking into monitors for pure computer gaming , you may want to look into a 16:10 monitor . If you want a monitor\/TV however , this is probably the best you will get at this size . The reddish\/clear detailing on the edges look good . This is n't a slim model , so it is heavier . It has a convenient handle on the back if you plan on carrying it around . The base is adequate , it allows tilting the screen up and down , but not side to side . It will wobble if you bump it or the table it is on , but is not a problem as long as you do n't move around too much . It comes with a 6 foot HDMI cord , however , in my experience , do not use it with computers . It causes hard to read text and degraded quality . I have read somewhere that you can fix it , but I messed around with the settings for awhile and I could n't get it to look good . Best to use a VESA or DVI for your computer . The HDMI cable is good for a TV or game system , no problem getting 1080p from my dish receiver with audio . It has composite in , headphones out , and a 1\/8 inch audio in jack in addition to the HDMI , DVI , and VESA that come standard with this type of product . TLDR : Amazing screen if you plan on using both a computer and game systems\/TV\/DVD on it . Great picture quality , sturdy -LRB- enough -RRB- construction , easy to use menu and settings . Adequate audio -LRB- do n't expect too much -RRB- . If you are looking for a pure gaming computer monitor , look elsewhere -LRB- 16:10 ratio and\/or higher resolution -RRB- . 	Monitor
This gadget gave me a different point of view on the way I exercise , even though I train often and regularly . I 'll give you a specific example . There 's this hike trail near my place -LRB- 1525 meter long , courtesy of my new Forerunner device -RRB- where I normally average 25 minutes . The first day I tried the heart monitor I was able to keep myself on a constant zone by monitoring the display every minute or so . When I reached the end of the trail I had done 22.5 minutes ! I really felt the difference afterward , the training was so much more effective because I overcame an unconscious desire to have ` mini-rests ' : I believe that the cardiovascular load was kept constant by maintaining the heart rate at a certain interval . After a bit of rest I did some dips and chin-ups , also monitoring my heart rate and the resting time . By the time I reached the last dip circuit I was doing exhaustion reps much quicker because I forced myself to keep the resting time constant . On the software side I have n't experienced any bugs , the data converts easily from xml to kml -LRB- for Google Maps -RRB- and the device syncs without any glitch . The altitude measurement has been a bit useless , wavering + \/ - 40 meters on flat jogging surfaces . The Garmin Training Center Software is very good . The heart rate monitor syncs with the Forerunner in a matter of seconds , the 4 display views in the Forerunner are all very appropriate for different needs and the interface is easy to get used to , despite the high number of options . The wrist belt seems sturdy enough , and there 's a replacement included . The device has an IP -LRB- ` Ingress Protection ' -RRB- certification , which means it can withstand rain and water up to an extent . This particular equipment can tolerate rain and up to 1m submersion for max 30 minutes . However , it can not be used for swimming . It is explicitly stated in the User 's Manual . 	Monitor
Alright , so my last LCD Acer monitor just died on me , and I decided to pick this up since it has gotten a good review score . -LRB- It 's also LED backlit ! -RRB- To my surprise , this monitor did better than expected . I would give this monitor 6 stars if I could . The design of the monitor is very intricate . It 's a simple , yet the design is elegant . Not to mention it 's really slim , lightweight , and easy to assemble . The color is REALLY good , like really really good . I have this monitor connected as hdmi-dvi and the picture is just beautiful . -LRB- I ca n't quite say the same for VGA since I have n't tried it out . -RRB- But overall , this monitor is a GREAT GREAT buy . \*\* Troubleshoot \*\* Also , If you do buy this monitor and realize that your screen is n't full -LRB- there 's still a black border around screen -RRB- , you have to manually adjust the GPU -LRB- Graphics Processing Unit -RRB- scaling . This means that if you have an ATI\/AMD Radeon Graphics card , open up Catalyst and adjust the display setting from there . Catalyst Control Center - -RRB- My Digital Flat-Panels I 'm not quite sure how to work it for the Nvidia GPU . \*\* End \*\* But in all , get this monitor . Definitely worth your money . 	Monitor
"Belkin missed the mark on this one . The way they aggregate and display the information makes this almost useless . I bought one and the device does two things : 1 -RRB- measures power used , displaying current Watts 2 -RRB- projects this into the future for a month or a year . Getting the actual measurement is impossible . I started playing tricks -LRB- like setting my electricity rate to $ 1.00 so I could see kWh as ` dollars ' but the same projection is done . It is not clear when the averaging starts or stops , or how long it has been going on , so you do n't even get the data you need to do useful extrapolations . Other than to see how-much-wlectricity-this-device-uses-now the Belkin meter is useless . I 'll give mine away to some friend . Granted , the physical design of the product is nice and smart -LRB- the display being remote to the cable -RRB- but in the end this is not a useful tool rather a toy .

I run more sprints than long distance and you can design your own workouts with alarms so its perfect for what i use it for . I also use it jumping rope , battle ropes , or even circuit training . Figuring out how to use the programs were not bad but once i got it down pat , I `` LOVE '' it ! Its last years model but so what , for $ 130 it was a steal for me . I would definitely buy one again , I use it for fitness and cardio for mma , but i have a friend that does triathalons , he bought one too and loves his ! Im sure some people will downgrade it , but you cant please everyone , especially the ones who complain about everything . 	Monitor
My beloved six year old NEC 21 '' monitor was finally giving up the ghost . We had spent so much quality time together . It started with me in a Mac only environment . It moved with me to PC and Unix machines . I dreaded the task of finding another display with the same quality , and doing so on a budget much smaller than the one six years ago . <p> After a few weeks with the G400 I 'm now thrilled that the old monitor is gone . Yes , it 's a 19 '' , not a 21 '' ... I ca n't tell . The higher scan rates and overall quality makes for a much sharper display at screen resolutions higher than I would ever attempt on my late monitor . Screen flicker is modest at even high resolutions -LRB- 1600x1200 -RRB- <p> The truly flat display tube was a bit odd a first . Having worked with curves screens all my life I 'd adapted to their distortions . The display is crisp and flat to the very edges of the tube . Now , going back to standard curved displays is jarring . <p> The video control -LRB- centering , contrast , brightness , etc. -RRB- takes some experimentation and is probably the weakest piece of plastic on the monitor . But after your initial setup you should n't need to use it often . <p> Since I work with multiple machines the dual video inputs with a switch located on the front of the display was a big plus . The machine also includes a Mac adapter . Note : the monitor comes with one video cable . If you 're attaching another machine -LRB- PC or Mac -RRB- you will need another . <p> Anyone planning on a 21 '' display might wish to consider saving themselves a significant amount of money with the G400 . Because size is n't everything . : -RRB- 	Monitor
I bought this monitor last September to replace my three year old 21 '' Dell LCD monitor . The price is great for such big screen . I am mostly pretty happy about the monitor . The only minor problem I had was : some times , when I push a key to woke the computer up , everything on the screen was fuzzy . There was also a half inch wide bar on the left side with lines go from the bottom of the screen all the way to the top . I had to put the computer to sleep again , than , woke it up . Everything would be fine . It seemed like the monitor could not catch up fast enough the 1st time woke up from the sleep mode . It did not happen very often and it did not bother me too much . But I did report this problem to the Planar service . I asked them if anybody had reported the same problem . They said no. . I was so surprised by how good the service was . Last week , I decided to make an exchange because the problem had happened more often . Again , the service was great . You talk to an American -LRB- rare these days -RRB- and I had no trouble making an exchange . I received the new monitor yesterday and put the old one in the same box , put the prepaid return label on the box , dropped off at UPS . If anybody encounter the same problem , please let me know . It is also possible that this problem is not related to the monitor -LRB- although I had never had such problem before with Dell monitor -RRB- . Overall , it is a great buy . 	Monitor
I was introduced to this fabulous tool by a girlfriend and then found out my sister had a 205 . Just an amazing tool to have and to use , compatible with Mac and PC for downloading your data to your computer and seeing your progress on a chart . The unit comes with the software . I 've been caught in some steady rain twice now while way out on runs and the unit has not fried in the water ! I really like the heart monitor feature on this unit too , for a while there I hemmed and hawed about whether I should just get the 205 version which does not have the heart monitor but I finally went with the 305 and love having all the data ! I highly recommend the 305 , and encourage all of you to give it serious thought ! 	Monitor
I bought this monitor because of all the excellent reviews it got , because of Viewsonic 's service reputation , past satisfaction with Viewsonic products , and because it looked good in a store . However , on my machine -LRB- a Dual Athlon with a Radeon 9700 card -RRB- it flickers incessantly , making it useless . Viewsonic has not responded with assistance or a warrantly replacement despite my submitting 3 requests with them . When it works , it looks nice for the price , but since it is unviewable about 50 % of the time -LRB- the flicker sets in after 2-6 hours of uptime -RRB- , that 's not so great . I 'd like to have given it a good review , but it 's hosed , and Viewsonic 's support has gotten very unresponsive since I last had a problem with one of their monitors . I am reconsidering whether or not to purchase any of their monitors in the future based on this experience . 	Monitor
Love having the freedom to run anywhere that I want and not having to worry about distance , pace , time . It keeps up with everything for you . My favorite things is knowing the elevations , grades , and weather -LRB- including wind speeds , temps - highs , lows , avg -RRB- . My only negative is that it 's so big on my wrist that it hurts my wrist bone . However , bought a wrist band and I put the watch on top of it . No more problems . 	Monitor
At this price , I should easily give this at least 4 stars , but I 'm unable to resolve this problem : I ca n't get the `` Integrated Speakers '' to work . Am I right in assuming that a `` Monitor with Integrated Speakers '' in today 's market means a monitor with `` in-built speakers '' ? I ca n't find any information about the `` speakers '' integrated into this monitor . Could ' t find an option to write to the seller ; so could somebody please , help me resolve this problem . I do not want to always use power speakers - I 'm trying to do my bit to reduce my carbon footprint ... 	Monitor

First off , I love my Garmin 305 . It has been my training partner for two years . The only problem is that I got caught in a thunderstorm and it died . There goes their claim as being water resistant . The bigger issue is there is no customer support for their products . I have emailed them for over two weeks about the issue and each time after around three days they respond , and it 's always from one person , and they ask me for information . I send them the information and then the same person after three days sends me an email telling me that he has no idea what my issue is and I repeat it . I 'm now on my third time . Do n't call either , they send you to that one same person and you have to sit on hold for 15-20 minutes and they keep interupting telling you to go online . What a joke . I think if a company wants to be the best it 's not only the product but the support . They need to follow in Apple 's footsteps on customer service . 	Monitor
This is a great product , I run with it back home -LRB- Netherlands -RRB- and carry it along when I come over to the US for work and run there . I have so many friends that got all excited about it that I keep on getting requests to bring them one . The Garmin Forerunner 305 works pretty easy and the screens are easy to adjust and read . 	Monitor
I had used the Garmin 205 for about 3 years and was quite satisfied with it . However , the 305 is a quantum leap in technology and versatility . The additional screens , smaller `` footprint '' , and improved satellite reception are impressive . Also like the fact that it fits like a regular watch . Only downside is the shorter battery time , but that is n't a big problem . Every runner who runs off road , travels , or just does n't want to have to drive their car over their running routes should own one . 	Monitor
Garmin knows GPS . Garmin does not know software . I spent weeks installing and reinstalling the software with the `` ant '' USB stick to try to get my data to upload . the software kept crashing and there was little instructions on how to resolve the problem . That being said , the watch itself is so amazing that I 'll still give this prodcut 4 stars . The watch is outstanding , I love it . 	Monitor
I bought this so measure the power consumption of various items around the house including a space heater . I can see how much power a halogen lamp uses compared to compact florescent ... All around it is a great item . The only downside is now you can see how much each device is actually costing . My plasma tv , stereo sound system , cable box , and wifi router uses about 400 watts with the tv being the majority . Now I have to convince my wife I need an LED tv to save the environment . Seriously though this device is excellent . Really helps in tracking down the power consuming devices and helps to raise your awareness of how much things really cost to run on a monthly or yearly basis . I learned that my refrigerator is not consuming nearly as much as I thought it was but also realized the tv draws a lot . Great device and for about $ 20 everyone should have one . 	Monitor
Got the product and used it one time and it would not come back on . Notified Garmin and sent them the watch , they sent me another one promptly . I really like the watch easy to use and gives me flexibility to arrange the data . Heart rate monitor is comfortable to wear as well as the watch . 	Monitor
The monitor is fine , but trying to get the desktop view adjusted was unnecessarily difficult , the onscreen adjustment controls are not as easy to use as my old ViewSonic . It was especially difficult to get the settings of the desktop to agree with a computer game video adjustments . I will probably get a ViewSonic next time , even though I like ASUS products .

I wanted to like this product , I really did . I originally had it hooked up to my workstation via DVI but I needed my laptop hooked up as well . It does n't support DisplayPort -LRB- 1st strike -RRB- so I had to order a $ 25 HDMI to DisplayPort adapter . I got that set up with my laptop only to see how horrible the picture was until I followed the great tutorial here by another contributer . But , what 's this ? The DVI now does n't work with my workstation . Once again , I spent way too much time on multiple days trying to sort out the problem through the menu . Finally I gave up and called Samsung . `` You are correct sir ... you can not connect both HDMI and DVI to two PC 's . It 's either one or the other . '' So ... this monitor is going back to the store . I tried to go cheap , but I 'm using this for my biz and I 'm going to have to buckle down and spring for Dell , Apple or NEC . Samsung especially falls short in their manual . All my issues could and should have been easily accessible in the manual but there is no mention of them anywhere ... strike 3 and back she goes ... 3 stars only because it should work fine for the average consumer ... just not for business .

I 've been a runner for approx . 7 years . I 've always used the stop watch feature on my watch . As for knowing how far I was running I would use my car to measure out the distances . The Garmin Forerunner 305 wrist watch gave me such freedom and info . while just being able to go out and get my run done . I do n't have to measure out the distance anymore because it 's right there on my 305 . It also has the capability of showing my pace at all times and figuring out how long a certain run should take if you need to keep it at a certain pace . It also comes with a heart rate monitor and will show you your rate when you have the attachment on . I have n't used that feature yet , to be honest . I imagine it would be very helpful for those of us who have a tendency to over train at times . 	Monitor
This is a great buy overall ; from my perspective . I have few criticisms with the Garmin , though , is the software they provide to analyze your workout data . The software has very limited capability and frequently makes errors in associating the type of workout . At least once a week it combines a bike workout with a run workout , even though the two workouts were on separate days and I was very careful to reset the watch . Combining the two makes it a varied workout and puts all the data into a separate category . One suggestion to Garmin is to make a version that can be worn in the water . Since I dabble in like to exercise I 'd love to gather readings in the water , too . I 'm very , very pleased with the Garmin 305 . So much so , that after 3 months of use , I bought one for my wife . The biggest selling points for me are the relatively small size , and the great reception . 	Monitor
I have got mine back in 2006 for 250 $ , hooked it up to MviX and installed it in my car . It still works great , but only if you use VGA connection . If you plan on using the plain old AV connectors , then you will be disappointed with the video quality . VGA looks crisp enough for a budget monitor like this . It is not the best monitor out there , and is not suitable to be used in a Car GPS application , because of its poor performance in the sunlight . 	Monitor
Plain and simply , functionality means nothing if the watch has no battery power to stay on . This would be a great watch if it had a battery that could hold a charge long enough to go for a run . If you love the looks of this watch , and are simply looking for a wrist decoration then this could be the watch for you . If you are a serious runner looking for something to track the pace of your runs I would suggest looking somewhere else . I bought this watch in December of last year , and I have had nothing but trouble . I was training for a marathon , and hoping that this watch could help me track my pace , and distances . I was excited when I bought it , and could n't wait to use it . Unfortunately after a few runs with it the watch kept rebooting , and would n't hold a charge long enough to stay alive for a 3 mile run , and that is after starting out with it fully charged prior to leaving out the door . I figured I must have a bad egg , and returned it to the sports store in which I purchased it . They apologized for the inconvenience , and informed me that not only was I not the first person to report these problems , but in fact they had two other people that very day come in to exchange the watch . They gave me an exact replacement on the spot . I have now had the second watch for 6 months , and it is now having the same problems as the first . It simply will not stay charged . I can hear it now , people are reading this thinking I have left my Ant + device turned on for the heart rate monitor , or the GPS is left on thereby draining the power . I can assure you that is not the case . I have babied this watch like I was walking around with an unbroken egg , carefully making sure I drain it to 0 before recharging it back to 100 % per the Garmin recommendations . It has not helped . I am out several hundred dollars , and now use the Map My Run application on my iPhone . It is at least reliable . I would steer clear of this watch . 	Monitor
I found this product to be easy to set up , and chock full of features . You can view your running path as a map , or in 3D . And it keepe trackof all your changes in pace , calories . Very customizable , can even change your pace ranges . Very helpful tool ! 	Monitor
I have been using this unit for about a month now and am very impressed with it 's performance . It tracks my runs accurately and has n't lost signal yet even on overcast days . Coupled with the Garmin Connect online site it has taken my workouts to the next level . 	Monitor
I think this is remarkable . I can go out and come back and look at what I 've done . It is very easy to use . I 'm somewhat computer illiterate and this has been understandable for use . I 've even used it in my car , just to see what would happen . I really would recommend this for someone who is training . 	Monitor
Incredible product . Simply put . Greatly exceeded my expectations for such a reasonably priced product ! It was easily installed . Very user friendly and powerful enough for any sound system . Bluetooth quality is superior to the competition . I know this from experience ! 	Monitor
easy to download and tracks a map of your run ... hard to locate satellites ... sometimes I get tired of stretching and start running before I can wait for it to find satellites . This results in maps incomplete because it finds the satellites while I 'm running . 	Monitor
This is the best monitor out there , the features packed into it such as 2 analog inputs , 1 dvi input , portrait and landscape screen rotation , sliding telescopic stand -LRB- not like Dell 's which only `` pops '' from low to high -RRB- and the clarity and crispness of the images could not be beat . I shopped around for months before making the leap to LCD , and after bringing home -LRB- and then returning -RRB- monitors from Dell , Sharp and Samsung - on every level , Viewsonic 's VP171B is the best . <p> When the price dropped to $ 519 on Amazon , I decided to replace all my CRTs , I BOUGHT 3 OF THEM !

This has been the best purchase in running accessories -LRB- besides good shoes -RRB- ! I love being able to see exactly how far and fast I am running , and to be able to compare it to other sessions . Highly recommend this item ! 	Monitor
I paid $ 523.00 for VeiwSonic in 2003 , I was told the monitor would last for ever . it lasted about 3 years . The picture started going negtive and would come back and finaly gone . It was a good thing I saved my Sony which I am still useing ! 	Monitor
Have been using this product for the past 3 weeks and it has preformed flawlessly . All expectations have been met and I have been pleased with it 's user friendly design . I am currently using it in the middle east and it has been picking up satellites very quick . All in all I consider it to be a great value and worth the money . 	Monitor
Its works . We like to walk a lot but not over measured courses . The 305 measures our walks with great precision . I have not tried any other of its talents yet . Garmin is the leader in GPS technology and the 305 is a good example of why . 	Monitor
"Getting the right monitor is a balancing act . My own monitor is a 27 inch 2560x1440 <ahref=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004YLCKYA/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/192-7410289-0764657""> Apple Thunderbolt Display </a> which I love but know is not for everyone due to cost and Thunderbolt requirement . I also have a 27 inch 1920x1080 <ahref=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004G8QO8O/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/192-7410289-0764657""> HP 2711x </a> which is cheap but has a poor picture and horrible viewing angles . In the middle , price wise , I bought this 24 inch 1920x1200 monitor for my wife , mainly because that is the maximum resolution supported by her 4 year old Mac Mini , and I have been pleased with the choice . At a higher resolution and smaller size then the 2711x , text is smooth and clear , while the IPS panel gives great viewing angles , and the colors have fine saturation without being cartoonlike . It 's comparable in picture quality and brightness to the more expensive Thunderbolt display and leaves the cheaper monitor in the dust . On the negative side , USB power management is too aggressive . I really do n't want to power down my USB devices if I turn off the monitor . I ended up not using the built in USB hub , this contrasts with the Thunderbolt which has USB , FireWire , Ethernet , a camera , a microphone , Thunderbolt out , speakers , a MacBook charging cable , and a subwoofer , most of which I use daily . So , this monitor is mainly about its excellent display and not accessories . I am happy it has a DisplayPort , in addition to DVI , so there is some future proofing there . The buttons and display LEDs are attractive , easy to find , and the configuration menu is easy to navigate . In general , if you want a real computer monitor , do n't have special requirements and are willing to pay for quality , I think you will be more than happy with this beautiful device . "	Monitor
It 's a good buy . I made sure I was aware of it 's limitations . Great picture so far . sound is terrible but surround sound is not too expensive . This is a great buy for the informed prepared buyer . 	Monitor
I could n't be happier with this purchase . The delivery was professional . The picture and sound are great . This was a true bargain . 	Monitor
The main problem with this monitor is that almost all of the resolution and frequency combinations cause the screen to dance and wave . In other words , they are unusable unless you want to get a headache after using your computer for a few minutes . Only a few of the combinations work . For some reason , 60Hz and 1600 \* 1200 works just fine . I 'd choose a lower resolution so that everything on my screen would n't be really small , but the lower resolutions do n't work , so I guess I 'm stuck with this setting . Strange , in a bad way . This monitor was bought as a replacement for a Mitsubishi Diamond Pro 900u , which was also a 19 '' . It gave me five good years before it decided it was time to go to monitor heaven . It was a great monitor while I had it . <p> CRT monitors are so cheap now ; I ca n't imagine there are n't some good cheap CRT 's . Check out what other customers say about other models . I guess I ca n't expect to get the same quality from a $ 200 monitor as I got from the $ 900 Mitsubishi . In any case , consider spending a bit more money on a better monitor . You are going to have to use it and look at it hour after hour . Get something else . 	Monitor

You wo n't get a flat screen 19 inch monitor for this price anywhere else . I 've been using for 7 ~ 8 months now , and I did not have a single problem with this . I read a complaint about driving 30 min to get it fixed -- but I do believe Samsung has advanced fix program where you call them , and they will send you a new one and charge your credit card , and after you receive your product , you send your broken one back , and they will credit your credit card back . How easy is that ? <p> Strongly recommended ! 	Monitor
Hey I go this on the cheap and did n't expect much but after 2months it began to flicker when booting up . Looking for invoice for warranty info right now : -LRB- Good over all picture when not flickering . 	Monitor
Clearly a great tool for cycling , and I love it - when it works . But I 've now had to return mine for the 5th time , due to the unit shutting itself off mid-ride . Very annoying , and dealing with Garmin customer service is super slow -LRB- usually 30-45 minutes on hold before you can find a human -RRB- Love it , just wish it were reliable . 	Monitor

WOW I was shocked to read all the negative reviews . I bought this TV for $ 900 about 3 years ago and it still works great . My only gripe would be the sound , but I 've since hooked it up to a surround sound system and it 's great . Of course there are much better TVs on the market but I was n't looking to spend alot of money and I 'm happy I did n't since I pleased with what I have . 	Monitor

I purchased this monitor because it was listed by Amazon as the newest version of ViewSonic 's flagship 3D monitor , the VX2268 . The first thing I noticed right out of the box was the light weight and hollow feel of the monitor , which was a major red flag . Light weight means that less hardware went into the construction , which means that they skimped on something . Turns out that something was refresh rate . Unlike almost all other 3D monitors which run 120hz , with this monitor at 60hz 3D is shown by alternating the two images on every other line of resolution at 30hz , or `` interlaced '' . Due to this , there is a greater amount of screen flicker when viewing 3D games , images , movies , etc. . That being said , as it is a passive system it does allow for less strain on the eyes which makes the flicker negligible if the monitor is used JUST for 3D applications . For more resolution heavy work , I myself work as a video and sound editor , the interlacing creates extremely noticeable `` scan lines '' that are visible at all times which creates extensive aliasing on all still screens despite the large screen resolution . All in all , this monitor is sub par to nearly all other monitors at this price range and size available today . Worst of all , nearly all text during 3D operation only shows every other line of resolution due to a major flaw in this design . Despite all of that it does have two saving graces ... the LED backlight and its passive 3D system . The reason I did n't give it one star is thanks to the passive 3D . It is a thousand times easier on the eyes than shutter glasses and while in motion the refresh rate is actually a fairly comfortable frame rate for video . For most games , however it is unacceptable . The LED lighting also lends to a very good contrast ratio not seen in most monitors , however due to the unfortunate decision to use a cheaper LCD core the sacrifice results in dull , lifeless colors . So , the Viewsonic V3D231 is just not up to standard as a computer monitor for any regular use outside of watching videos . It is however compatible with most 3D BluRay players and the PS3 which is seems to be better suited for . 	Monitor
I purchased three of these for my firm , and all had severe focus problems that plagued them within three months . When new , they were beautifully sharp , but they started to `` drift '' in and out of focus , so badly that text at higher resolutiuons was a mere gray blur . <p> Sony service has been very reluctant to cure the problem , returning the monitors with the same problem after claiming they were repaired . I would recommend the NEC units instead ; we have had good luck with all 5 of the flat 21 inch units we have . <p> FYI , Sony service is extremely difficult to contact . Plan on spending hours on hold queues , often to be transferred to busy signals or dead lines . This has been consistent over my two months of experience with them . Very dissappointing for such a large company . <p> By the way , nobody at service can give you a direct line , so you must wade through endless -LRB- and changing -RRB- teleprompt menus and wait through multiple hold queues -LRB- each one at risk of killing you with the busy or dead line -RRB- every time you call just to get an intelligent update on your repair orders .

I bought this monitor here a number of months back to replace my one year old 19 '' Sceptre LCD . Not that there was anything wrong with the 19 '' ... I just wanted to go to a larger screen and Sceptre 's performance and pricing make it ever more tempting . Upon setting the monitor up , I was completely in awe of the crispness of the display . . so much so that I was kind of remiss in setting up my wife with the 19 '' . ; - -RRB- There were no dead pixels -LRB- and that is true today as well -RRB- , no `` fuzzy '' spots , no distortion lines , no ghosting of text , nothing ... it was crystal clear . The Sceptre 's performance covers day to day usage easily . . but in my opinion , where it really starts to shine is when gaming . I play a few different games . . Unreal Tournament and City of Villains to give you an idea . None of these games showed any sign of ghosting or clarity degradation due to response time of the monitor -LRB- and this is with all of the graphics settings as high as they will go -RRB- . The 19 '' I was using had no issues doing the same so I did not expect that the 20 '' -LRB- which has a slightly faster response time -RRB- would either . I `` drive '' the monitor via a GeForce 6800 Ultra with the DVI cable and run it in its native resolution . As a side note . . too often I have seen reviews on LCDs that complain about clarity when running a resolution that is not native ; but that is the price you pay for running the monitor outside of its native resolution ... so if you plan on running in a resolution other than 1680 x 1050 -LRB- or if your video card does not support it -RRB- , then be expected to see a `` sub-standard '' display . There are really only two things that I would mention that are a `` pain '' with this monitor . The first is the fact that the panel controls just seem awkward to use -LRB- same was true on the 19 '' -RRB- so tweaking settings can be somewhat time consuming and frustrating . The other item is that there is no `` auto adjust '' button for it . I have grown accustomed to my HP 2025 monitor at work having the test pattern utility to fire up and then press the auto adjust button to reset everything . Since I am unaware if this is a standard feature of most LCDs , I 'm not willing to let it affect the 5 star rating ... Overall though , I am not sure I could be happier ... until next year when bonuses come out and I see a larger Sceptre monitor out there just screaming at me to buy it ! : -RRB- 	Monitor
The acer ferrari 20-inch LCD is a masterpiece . The external looks justify the badge - sleek black surround and a glossy rich red stand . controls are discreetly tucked away to the side but easily accessible , and ports on the back are hidden but easy to find . performance is great - blacks are rich and dark , colors well saturated , and speed eminently up to scratch . I have yet to try playing DVDs but gaming -LRB- half-life 2 , call of duty -RRB- is superb . Well and truly a bargain . 	Monitor
I have using it the last 6 month and i am very happy with it . I trust in the accuracy of the measure . I am not using the heart rate monitor due i am not interested -LRB- yet -RRB- for measuring my heart -LRB- prefer conventional method : -RRB- -RRB- 	Monitor
Do n't get me wrong , this is a good camcorder . I love all of the functions and it 's really easy to get started with and use . The built-in light and stability features are too die for . There are tons of accessories you can get to enhance your pictures and vhs quality . But , it 's not a true digital camera . And the digital camera function could be improved on . I get better quality photos using my scanner at home . The software that comes with the system is not adequate either . I feel that the $ 649 retail price I paid for this camcorder is WAY too much . <p> However , all-in-all the camcorder is excellent . But I do recommend you buy a back-up battery or stay close to an outlet because the battery barely makes the full 2 hours it claims it has . We thought we 'd be able to shoot basketball games , but it barely makes through the first half on 1 batterty . If you can get a good deal on it go ahead and get it ! 	Monitor
The Garmin Forerunner 305 is a great GPS sports watch . I have enjoyed it . You can use this watch for multiple things . I have used it to track athletic activities such as running and cycling , and also for things like walking my dog , hiking , and riding in the car during a road trip . 	Monitor
I had this monitor and it started to make a loud noise one night and I could smell a strong odor of copper wire burning eminating from it . The screen was black on the sides and white down the middle . When I hit the mouse to clear the screen and it started to make a shrill sound and I just pulled the plug . I had this for less than a year . If your kids have this in their room please take care . I 'm the only one that used this . 	Monitor
The Color and resolution on this LED backlight LG EW224T LCD Monitor is pretty exceptional . It has a nice Anti-glare Matte surface that does a great job of scattering the light so that it is not reflected back to your eyes as glare . The color is very vibrant and the viewing angles are excellent considering that this is not an IPS -LRB- in-plane-switching LCD panel -RRB- . The contrast on this thing is very impressive too ! The blacks looked very dark ... much better than I 've seen on most monitors . I wanted to mention that this monitor came with a driver disc , if you 're running Windows 7 ... the OS seems to recognize the monitor just fine without the need to install the drivers . But it 's nice to know that they actually included the drivers disc just in case . The monitor also comes with two video out ports , one VGA and one DVI port with included cables for both . You should be aware that this monitor does not have an HDMI video out port , and does not have speakers built into the unit . With that said , if your computer has a blu-ray drive and you want to watch Blu-ray movies through the monitor ... the picture on the monitor looks excellent for viewing Blu-rays . I used the VGA port and it still looks spectacular on this screen . Of course if you intend to watch videos , you 'll have to make sure you have speakers connected to your computer -LRB- or you 'll have to use the built-in speakers on your laptop if you are outputting from a laptop -RRB- because as I mentioned before , this monitor does not have built-in speakers . To me , this is n't a deal breaker but I think they should have included speakers even if they were super cheap sounding ones ... especially in this price range . There are cheaper monitors that offer speakers . One other thing about this monitor that I think could have been improved upon was the monitor stand . First off , I would like to mention that it was very easy to put together -LRB- no tools required -RRB- . The monitor stand also allows you to tilt the monitor up and down -LRB- via a built-in hindge -RRB- and I noticed that while I was adjusting the viewing angle by tilting the monitor up and down that it seemed to wobble a bit . It does n't seem super flimsy or anyting but it did surprise me how much it wobbled while adjusting it . After it stopped wobbling , it did seem to be stable and did not tilt down on it 's own . However , over time I wonder if the hindge will loosen to the point where it will not be as stable . Only time will tell , I suppose . Conclusion : Even though there are some minor things I pointed out about the monitor that could be improved upon , I do n't think that they were big enough for me to take away a star . The vibrance , contrast , and sharpness of this monitor warrants me giving it a full 5 Stars . If you have a video card , I would highly recommend you playing with the display settings on your computer to make full use of the color range that this montitor can produce . For example , playing with the contrast levels can really bring out the inky blacks that this thing is capable of producing . For anyone that is looking for a wonderful looking led-backlit monitor that is no-frills and does the job exceedingly well , I 'd recommend this LG monitor . The images it can produce is truly a feast for one 's eyes : -RRB- PROs : - Wonderful vibrancy , resolution , and contrast . Images look amazing on this thing - Energy Efficient ... or so it says . That 's always a plus . - Easy to install . Just plug it in and Windows 7 should recognize it just fine . I 'm not sure about Mac PC 's because I do n't have one . - The Stand is Easy to put together , no instruction or tools needed . All you need is to tighten an included thumb screw . - Two Video cables included ... VGA and DVI . This shoud be a no-brainer but in the world of cost-cutting , included cables are getting more increasingly rare . I 'm glad they included one of each so you have a choice for which one you 'd like to use . - Attractive glossy black frame and blue led light that is n't too bright or distracting . - Matte Screen does a great job of eliminating most of the glare . CONs : - No HDMI support . I knew this before I ordered it , but I think that most people expect HDMI support now-a-days . - No built-in Speakers . It would be nice to have speakers even if they were cheap sounding . Options are always nice ... says me . - The stand wobbles a bit when adjusting\/tilting the screen up and down ... although it seems to stabilize and hold it 's position after wobbling for a second . I think it could have been engineered to be more stiff and sturdy ... but it 's still functional so I did n't take any stars away . 	Monitor
I absolutely love my 305 . I have had it for about 2 months , and have had no problems . The HR monitor works great , and the GPS has been spot on . Garmin Training Center software is excellent . The ability to customize and schedule my workouts in advance has made my life much easier . The unit is slightly large and at first moved around on my wrist . I now use a sweat band underneath it ; it is very comfortable and does n't shift . I highly recommend the Garmin 305 . 	Monitor
This watch is great for running with , because I can run wherever I want instead of setting up my routes online . I use it for coaching my track and cross country teams . I use it for marathon training and during my marathons . Elevation feature might be a bit off , but I do n't use that for anything . Heart rate is a great feature to use to see my progression of fitness . Love that I can have it auto lap my mile splits . I recommend it to all my friends . 	Monitor
After doing a basic amount of research , I decided to give the ML228H a try . I was replacing an older computer that went `` kaput '' where I was using a 19 '' Daewoo CRT-type display . Even though there were no problems with the monitor I decided to get a flat screen monitor with the new computer since it seems like a lot of websites are now configured for the wider displays that are becoming so common . I did want a `` nicer '' flat screen and quite honestly figured I would be spending more than I did on this ASUS . I have to say after just a few days with this monitor I am 100 % satisfied with it . It arrived quickly with no sign of shipping damage . It was fairly easy to assemble out of the box and get set up . I have no qualms so far with image quality or response time . Since I 'm still getting everything set up with my new computer , I have not done any gaming with this monitor yet , but I have watched some videos . I do n't expect to be disappointed when I do start up with gaming , however . From what I could see from the research I did , for more money you could step up to a monitor with `` IPS '' technology which I believe helps with viewing the monitor from wider angles without that LCD washout effect . Since I only use my monitor sitting directly in front of it at my desk , I decided this was something that was not important and would rather focus on high resolution\/HD with LED backlight and fast response time . This is my first experience with anything from ASUS but I would not hesitate to buy this monitor again if I needed to . 	Monitor
What a fantastic monitor . The colors are bright and sharp . I had a regular 19 '' monitor but that took up the majority of my desk . This one is so tiny and it hardly takes up any room . And if you 've ever tried to carry a 19 '' monitor you know how awkward it is . This monitor is so light that I can carry it with one hand . The only downside is that sometimes the colors are skewed . Overall , it 's worth the price . 	Monitor
As with all LCD monitors , this analog unit saves space and generates far less heat than a CRT . It is a practical , straightforward monitor . It produces a bright , clear , and sharp image -LRB- as long as you keep it on its native resolution of 1024x768 -RRB- . The screen is viewable from far-wide left and right . The display on the 570V appears to have a viewing area equal to my Nokia 17 '' CRT . The 570V is easy to use , having an auto menu that includes screen calibration . <p> I did have problem , though . After about 3 months , a single-pixel vertical line appeared from top to bottom about three inches from the left . Samsung technical support was extremely responsive . They sent another unit within a few days . All I had to do was to send the original back in the same packaging . The replacement was a refurbished model that appeared brand new . Only catch was that the replacement has a 1-year warranty ; the original had a 3-year warranty . The replacement has been flawless since getting it about 4 months ago . 	Monitor
Either I am not using it correctly , or I 'm just plain old unhappy . Here 's why : 1 . The calorie counter does n't seem to be accurate ; according to some deeply hidden reviews , it does NOT calculate correctly . 2 . The strap lowers and I can not make it any tighter . 3 . GPS is good ; but I could now just use free APPS on my iPhone . 4 . To set up runs , it takes a great deal of navigation to get to interval training . 5 . In summary , it 's not user-friendly . My iPhone and the Free Apps -LRB- like runkeeper , etc. -RRB- are much easier to use . 6 . Product is really bulky ; thought it would be fine . It 's not . 	Monitor
I bought the 305 to help maintain pace while training for a marathon . My thoughts : GPS RECEPTION : I have had no problems . Only once did it take more than a minute or two to find the signal . It also keeps signal on trails through the woods that I like to run . BATTERY LIFE : Could be better . I put the 305 on the charger whenever not in use to avoid a dead battery minutes into a run . The first time I used it , I got only about 21\/2 hrs of total life -LRB- 21\/2 separate runs -RRB- . It has a battery life indicator , but it does not show one on the page that I usually view -LRB- pace \/ distance \/ time -RRB- . COMFORT : I do not have huge wrists and the 305 is not the most comfortable watch . I find it more comfortable if I loosen it up just a bit and push it further up my arm than where I would wear a typical watch . The 405 looks more comfortable , but for the cost and potential other draw backs I chose the 305 . Still glad I did . ACCURACY : Appears to be fine . It seems to agree pretty well with my Garmin Oregon 400 . I have not done the `` to the foot '' testing that other GPS reviewers do . NEGATIVES : Battery life , comfort , not waterproof -LRB- I would love to wear this in triathlons -RRB- . PROS : Reception in woods , stores your workouts , MUCH better than any of those `` foot pod '' gadgets -LRB- I tried the NIKE + Ipod thing - do n't waste your money -RRB- , keeps me on pace ! PURCHASE AGAIN : Yes . 	Monitor
Once again -- I find myself trying out a item that I wish was available to me 7 years ago ... when I needed to test the output of a whole bunch of electrical items . Back then I had to hire an electrical Engineer to tell me what I was using to dispute a elelctric bill . Now , because of this little unit -- you no longer have to go thru the confusion and craziness that I did . All you have to do now is plug it in and read the display ... easy as pie to use and understand . Now you can tell when its time for a certain item to go because its drawing too much electricity ... or tell when you need to use a certain thing more becasue its so frugal . When you plug this unit in it shows it is using 0 - 0.5 watts . I tested my pencil sharpener ... and when I plugged it into the unit there was no change -- therefore showing it does not DRAW power until used ... ... as I began to sharpen my pencil the power use went up steadly to 69.17 watts . You can then press a '' $ '' symbol and it shows you what a years worth of this item will cost you . Co2 imprint as well . Thats the sort of information this unit will give you . Excellent information to figure out your electrical use ! Great product . 	Monitor
I should have said `` saved my baby '' because that 's how I feel . When I read online that my beloved Keurig used 400 watts of power in it 's `` stay warm '' phase I decided I had to give it up - 400 watts is the same as a small air conditioner or 4 refrigerators . Could n't justify that . I decided to buy this monitor to reveal other energy hogs I was harboring . Very insightful . Easy to use . I liked that the monitor and plug are separated by a cord . Outlets are sometimes not conveniently located . Anyway , after weeks of coffee disappointment I powered up my retired Keurig -LRB- could n't take it anymore ... maybe this should be a review for Keurig haha -RRB- . To my surprise it 's `` warm up '' phase used 1200 watts not the reported 1500 and and all the important `` stay warm '' phase used 3 not the dreaded 400 !!! At some point it might use a little more but I 've been watching it 2 hours and not so far . Thank you Belkin ! 	Monitor
I have rated the quality of the GS773 as very poor . I , the customer , should never have to make pincushion and trapezoid adjustments . Number one , I do n't have the test equipment needed to make the adjustments correctly nor do I have the proper service manual needed for such an operation . To top things off , ViewSonic is ISO 9000 rated , so much for the ISO rating . Please note , the comments above were put on my `` Warranty Registration '' to ViewSonic . 	Monitor
I got these at a great discount , and I 'm very pleased with them . The sound range is impressive enough , and I can certainly make the difference between these and average 20-20K Hz headphones . After several days daily use , I can only say these have made me realize how a poor format choice for audio can be more detrimental than poor hardware -LRB- upgrading music library to . flac from . mp3 -RRB- . Construction feels solid enough , though not suitable for headbanging : they WILL fall off , but hat 's expected . 	Monitor
Considering the viewable area afforded by conventional CRTs of the same size this panel is lighter , has better contrast and has a smaller footprint making it ideal for college or high school students . I bought two , the first had to be returned and was replaced with no questions however the return shipping was delayed but was UPS ' fault . I strongly recommend to any cost conscience buyer .

I use mine for cycling and running , the direct link to see your workouts mapped on GOOGLE EARTH is FANTASTIC !!!! -LRB- the included software is far more stable than the junk Polar included with their HRM 's . Heart rate strap with replaceable battery is coded and comfortable . It 's better in my opinion than the Polar products -LRB- of which I 've owned three -RRB- This is much better than the Forerunner 201 which I previously owned -LRB- locks on satellites 10 times faster -RRB- and I 'd avoid the 405 unless you really want to use this watch as a normal day to day wristwatch -LRB- check out the 405 reviews -RRB- One nice feature is being able to customize the display screens . Another review criticized the 305 for the numbers being too small to read while exercising . I do n't have an issue but would point out that you can significantly increase the size of the display by simply displaying fewer fields . My only complaint is that it 's easy to leave it on and run the battery down - which is a bummer if you 're just about to work out . I wish there was an `` auto off '' feature which would shut it down if it detects no movement or heart rate within an hour or so . Fortunately , with Li-Ion batteries , as little as a 10 minute charge gives you enough juice for a 90 minute run . If you 've found this review to be helpful , please let me know ! 	Monitor

I ran for nearly a year with just a regular watch before getting my Garmin 305 . I ca n't believe I was ever able to properly train without it . I run a lot of trails and peaks and I 've never been able to properly gauge mileage and speed . Now , not only do I know how far I 'm going , but what kind of elevation gain and incline I 'm working . On the road , I have now been able to start properly training for road races by doing real tempo and interval workouts , something I always had to guess at before . This watch has truly changed the way I run . The bulkiness is not even noticeable now and I have personalized my display settings in such a way that I get to see the exact information I want within the first two screens . I originally bought the watch for my wife and I to share . Is it bad that I do n't want to share any more and just buy her another one ? 	Monitor
I got the Garmin 305 with all the bike accessories for a Christmas gift and I used it some and was okay with it . But I had some injuries and my training went by the wayside . Now I am training for a half Ironman and I use it almost everyday . I often do not get the opportunity to run or bike with someone , so I love the Virtual Partner . You say that you want to do a 30 minute run and want to run an 8:00 min\/mi pace and then it will show you against a virtual partner that is running that pace . It shows you how far ahead or behind you are . Connecting to the computer is super easy as well . Turn the device off , attach to the docking station and then plug in the USB , or leave the USB attached and then one click and you have all your data saved . Very easy to manipulate the charts to show what you care about the most . Even if you forget to change your workout from a run to a bike workout , when you get on the computer , just drag the workout to the other folder . I recommend this to anyone that is doing a training program . Pros Cons Very accurate Bigger than a watch -LRB- does n't bother me though , not heavy -RRB- Easy to connect to computer Variety of settings 	Monitor

Had this T.V. \/ monitor now for 4 days . Got it to replace a much older 42 '' projection Sony . Looks nice mounted on the wall and so far it 's been great . Most mention that you have to adjust the color\/brightness . I find this to be true with just about any T.V. or monitor that I 've used . I 'm not going to give a lower rating because I had to set it to my liking . I will say the speakers are a little on the weak side but do as I need for my bedroom . I 'm not looking for home theater in my room . 	Monitor
Was easy to figure out how to set up and use ... and it is small enough not to be a problem when running . The display is large enough for me an older runner who needs reading glasses . I used the heart rate monitor only once for now , it worked just fine . The watch had no problem aquiring a satellite signal quickly . Being a life long distance runner this is a great add on for training runs and racing if needed . 	Monitor
I really could n't believe this when I plopped this sucker on my desk . I used to have an old 17 '' monitor in this spot , and with this new 19 '' monitor I suddenly had 6 more inches of deskspace ! <p> ViewSonic is one of the best monitor vendors in the business -- they 're always pushing the envelope , yet keeping their reputation as a manufacturer of reliable equipment . With this monitor , you can run -LRB- your video card permitting -RRB- at 1600x1200 at 78Hz , which means you get top notch resolution at a pretty good refresh rate -LRB- i.e. no flicker -RRB- . <p> About the only drawbacks I can find are that it does n't come with a built-in USB hub like some of the newer models do , and that there is a slight curvature to the tube . It 's plenty flat enough , unless you 're one of those types that has to have the perfectly flat screen . My mother , my sister , and I all have one of these PS790 's , and we have absolutely zero complaints ! 	Monitor
It is hard to find an LCD monitor in standard 4:3 resolution . I have poor vision and wanted a replacement for my CRT monitor . Widescreens actually have less screen area than a standard monitor of the same measurement and you need to get a larger one to get an equivalent screen height . Larger screens have higher resolution , so everything is smaller and can be harder to see . If you run a lower than native resolution , they use interpolation , so the graphics are not as good . The 19 '' Asus is very sharp and clear . It was advertised as being 1024x768 , but the native resolution is actually 1280x1024 . I was concerned about that , but I am currently running it and have no problem seeing it . Everything is about the same size as 1024x768 was on my old 17 '' CRT , but I have a lot more vertical screen area for displaying web pages . Colors are excellent , the viewing angle is wide and the response time for videos is fine . If you are looking for a standard resolution LCD monitor , this Asus is a good choice . 	Monitor

Great product . Great price on Amazon . You need a maters degree in GPS Watch Management to figure out all the options , but even for a tech simpleton like me , it took just a little while to figure out the basics . Highly recommend . 	Monitor
I had the same problem as everyone else , and I shipped the monitor back to NEC . They shipped me another FE991SB so I would n't have to wait on the repairs , and it developed the SAME PROBLEM AGAIN . I took it to a TV and electronics repair shop , and the guy fixed it for about $ 60 and I have n't had a problem for two years now . It 's well worth $ 60 to get this monitor repaired as compared to buying a whole new one . 	Monitor
I bought two of them and used side by side . I would have loved to have had these monitors work out for me . I have a black and white case , black and white keyboard , black and white mouse , black and white desk ... you get the picture . I was really looking forward to these monitors because it fit the style that I was trying to exhibit , but also that they appeared to be of better quality . Unfortunately , this is n't the case . As you might have already assumed , I am someone who is rather particular about aesthetics . It takes no leap of imagination to understand that I am actually an artist , specifically graphic artist . I know these are not professional grade , and I knew that when I purchased them . But I never realized how poor the monitors would be once I got them . My problem has been primarily the issue with the temperature . One of my monitors is heavily blue , almost green blue . The other monitor is a warm , yet I think acceptable color . Not quite right , but I can live with it . The temperature settings on the monitors themselves are too drastic to properly adjust the color , and the resulting color is not something that can be changed by the RGB scale . When altered , one color will eventually become dominant , and distort others . The design itself it pretty decent . I was concerned about how large the bevel on the bottom is , and let me tell you , I do n't like it . It is a bit too large , almost daunting . The base , although looks really cheap , I actually find really nice . Very heavy and weighted , not flimsy like a lot of monitors have . Though , unfortunately does n't quite fit right with the other parts of the design . They should have used a more angular base . There is a warm spot that other people are talking about . It is in the top right , couple inches down and to the left . I am curious to why it is warm there . My other monitor , the one I replaced to get dual monitor , never had this problem . If you are using it as a single unit , and color is not important to you , this is a decent monitor . It looks fair , the display is decent . The viewing angles are not horrible , much better than cheap laptops . But , it is still a very mediocre monitor . 	Monitor
The Garmin Forerunner 305GPS is great . I love how I can download the information on to my computer & analyze the data later . 	Monitor
This product works fine if you want to know your speed , your miles , heart-rate , your map and many of the features you may want -LRB- many of which are available on cheaper bike speedometers -RRB- . Two features I really wanted and the reason I bought this product were total elevation gain and hill-grade . Both are WORTHLESS on this device . My friends have the higher priced Garmin bike GPSs and they are much more accurate . My elevation gain is always 500-1 ,000 feet different than theirs . The grade - % feature bounces around -LRB- as high as 25 % - I wish ! -RRB- as I climb a steady hill , so I never get an accurate read . I have sent many emails to Garmin and have received responses ranging from polite -LRB- but no help -RRB- to downright rude . They claim that elevation gain differences -LRB- between devices -RRB- are normal -LRB- 1,000 feet per ride ?? -RRB- . So , after a hard hill ride I really have no idea how many feet I have gained . I can not recommend this product . If you want your speed , miles and heart-rate , buy a much cheaper product . If you need elevation-gain and grade -LRB- and the mapping feature -RRB- , pay -LRB- much -RRB- more for the better Garmin product . 	Monitor
We got two of these for both our laptops . They plugged in and worked seamlessly with Windows 7 , and provide bright , sharp , clear video quality . Just a no-nonsense monitor that looks and feels like it 's well-made , highly recommended . 	Monitor
I can not belever who can pay more than $ 4000 . Off course there might be a better quality , but if you are an average TV watcher or movie fan , you can satisfy with it . It 's a really really a good buy . 	Monitor
I am a beginner runner so this review comes from that view point . Wanted a heart rate monitor to keep me in my target heart rate . I wanted to know my distance and pace during the walk\/run . My Forerunner delivered . It was easy to set up , I can check the screen and read it as I am moving and adjust my speed accordingly . It alerts me when I am above and below my thr . It also alerts me when I have completed a lap -LRB- I set my laps at one mile intervals . -RRB- . So I am always getting feedback on my progress . I look forward to my 4 miles everyday as I use the Forerunner to challenge myself to keep on pace . Since I live in New England , I plan to get the foot pod for indoor use in winter when running the roads can be dangerous . Before the Forerunner , I tended to run the same route as I knew the distance . Now I can change course whenever because the Forerunner will let me know the distance and keeps me on pace . This is a great training partner . The only downside is that I noticed the battery will die out if I do n't remember to turn it off after my run . So , I just do n't let that happen ! 	Monitor
I love this thing ! I just received mine on Saturday December 4th . I charged it up and took it on a run the next morning . The cloud cover was very thick but after a few minutes it found the needed satilites and it never lost GPS connectivity throughout my run . In fact after charging the device Saturday I installed the software to my pc then turned on the device . It found the needed satilite data in my livingroom . Setup was a breeze , and now I have taken it on four run 's and it 's been AWESOME ! Amazon ROCKS as well . I received my order a day or two ahead of schedule , and the box was in perfect shape . I highly recommend getting one of these devices . 	Monitor
I use this LCD TV as a monitor for my recent Mac Mini . I think everything is fine , the color is n't top notch , but there is one problem : The Optical Out does not take any of my optical cables that work for all other devices I own . Anybody get this problem too ? 	Monitor
I used the forerunner 305 to train for my first half marathon which I completed in 1:59:00 so I was pretty pleased . It was great to get out and run without premeasuring distances etc. . The forerunner keeps track for you . I 've uploaded several training runs to the MotionBased website . I 'm very glad I bought this . 	Monitor
If you want to start running and make running a life commitment you are going to love the garmin 305 . This watch is not only a tool that will help you log your miles online and keep a record of your progress , but a motivator that will make you jump out of bed every morning and go for a run . What I like about this sports watch is that it does not need a foot pod -LRB- which reduces the price compared to other sport watches that rely on this to track mileage -RRB- and that the screen is big enough so you can read it as you run . What else can I say , I love my Garmin 305 . The 205 is similar to the 305 , the only difference is that the 205 does not measure heart rate . 	Monitor
I 've used and abused this mouse everyday for about 3 years , on 2 different laptops , and its performance has been flawless . Hard to believe after all the varieties of mice I 've used over the years that one this cheap would out perform them all . The cord has just the right stiffness - it never gets in the way or gets tangled up . It 's almost like it 's not there . It plugs firmly into the usb port on both of my Dell laptops . It works on practically ANY surface ... I have n't used a real mousepad in years . I like the scroll wheel - it 's the kind that moves in measured bumps , as opposed to a totally smooth motion . The buttons are not oversensitive , but not hard to click , either . And the size is perfect , too . Dimensions are roughly 35\/8 '' -LRB- 94mm -RRB- long , 11\/4 '' -LRB- 32mm -RRB- at its highest point , and 17\/8 '' -LRB- 48mm -RRB- wide . 	Mouse
I 'm using this mouse with my MacBook 's built-in bluetooth . The buttons and feel are great , and although the size is a little small in my hand I find the mouse to be very usable . The `` forward '' button is in a really awkward place -- nowhere near any of my fingers -- so it took considerable practice to learn how to reach it . And despite what others have said here , there is a new version of the MS keyboard\/mouse software which lets you use all of the buttons and program them to do specific things in each application . Even the presenter controls work -- to do a degree . I find the presentation controls frequently lock up the mouse , and it rarely works to switch from presentation mode back into pointer mode . The big problem with this mouse is that it frequently cuts off . It will disconnect from the computer for about 5 seconds . This frequently happens 3 or 4 times in a row , so that it takes about 25 seconds of shaking the mouse around to get it back into working condition . This happens most frequently when the computer has been sleeping , but also randomly happens if I use the computer for a while -LRB- say ... over an hour -RRB- . This is why I 'm giving the mouse 2 stars . I paid $ 90 for it , and the darn thing still slows me down when I 'm trying to jump on my computer and do something really quickly . Plus nothing is more irritating than being in the zone , working on a project , and all of a sudden the mouse cuts out and you lose your train of thought trying to fix it . So I think it 's a good pack-in mouse to travel with , and I use it day to day for most tasks , but when I 'm working I get a USB mouse and plug that in , so I do n't put up with the constant annoyance of this mouse not doing its most basic function . I would have given it one star , but I think the laser pointer built in is an interesting novelty and definitely something that will catch people 's attention when you 're giving a presentation . Just hope your mouse does n't die in the middle of the presentation . 	Mouse
Recently started using this product , and I love it ! So much easier than a regular mouse , which I have used forever . Very ergonomic with a lot less hand motion , and the scroll ring is awesome ! I have this installed on a PC running MS Vista 64-bit . Did NOT install the MouseWorks software . Vista instantly recognized it . My only minor annoyance is that I have n't been able to figure out how to re-program the buttons , but they do virtually everything I want anyways -LRB- just slightly differently than I would have arranged them -RRB- . So that 's why I took one star away . Buttons are pre-assigned as follows : Top Left - opens link in new tab -LRB- on Firefox -RRB- ; Top Right - Go back one page ; Bottom Left - Select -LRB- standard left click -RRB- ; Bottom Right - Right click menu -LRB- standard right click -RRB- . Comes with the Trackball itself -LRB- obviously -RRB- , the wrist pad , MouseWorks software , and has a USB plug with an optional PS\/2 adapter . Would get this for every computer I own -LRB- except it is a little pricey for that - I 'll have to suffer at work ... maybe -RRB- . 	Mouse
This is a great little gadget . I had no problem inserting the battery pack to make it fit smoothly . The feel and functionality of the mouse remained intact . The charge lasts for a long time , but when recharging , the charging light never stops blinking to come to a steady green , so you have to guess when it is fully charged . Small price to pay for having an instant charging option rather than searching for brand new batteries each time it needs recharging . 	Mouse
when the shobby goods saturated in the E-market , we find a star here : this mouse is not firry by its outlook , but it is truly designed for customers . It is confortuble for both right hand and left hand , also , for both USB and PS2 port . I trully `` feel '' the sound , it is much better than `` I feel '' mouse . It is good for Children too . my grandson nestled on my chair and plaid this dancing mouse with Disney game for such long time . Usualy , his interest would be ebbed very soon with his , games , but , this time , he just sit there to `` feel '' the music . 	Mouse
I 'm a programmer and I spend most of my day on the computer typing . Because of that , I 've gotten used to fairly nice keyboards and mice since they tend to perform better and also last longer . When I got this Verbatim keyboard and mouse , I knew immediately that I was n't going to use it on any of my dev systems . But , I figured it would work great on a laptop that my wife uses from time to time in a docking station . Honestly , I have to say that the keyboard was surprisingly impressive for the price . I like the feel and I really love that all the delete , insert , and arrow keys are in the traditional placement ! This keyboard fits the bill perfectly for a light-use wireless unit . The mouse , on the other hand , was not as impressive . It is an optical mouse , which puts it at a major disadvantage against comparable laser mice when it comes to tracking . You may feel like an optical mouse tracks just fine - but using a laser mouse for a while will change that opinion . It also only has 3 buttons -LRB- I really missed the forward\/back buttons -RRB- and it felt kind of cheap anyway . Maybe I 'm being a bit hard on the mouse since I 'm comparing it to units that probably costs 5 times more - but I guess you get what you pay for . Overall , I would recommend this kit for someone who is a light computer user and has n't had problems with the tracking on optical mice . The keyboard is impressive for the price and the mouse works OK . 	Mouse
What more can I say ? If you have a single PS\/2 style connection on your PC or laptop and need to split them in order to connect a separate mouse and keyboard this is your adapter . 	Mouse
The driver for this mouse caused my Dell Vista system to freeze repeatedly , which it had never , ever done before . I put my old Dell mouse back on but the system kept freezing . I called the support number in the mouse software help screen to get advice on how to uninstall the software , but it referred me to a new number for paid support at 9.99 per call . So I hunted up a Microsoft support number and got an overseas call center . I spoke with three agents , all of whom insisted that the Product ID number on the back of my mouse had insufficient digits - 20 digits vs the 16 my mouse carried . Lacking a valid PID number they refused to connect me with free tech support , but only offered me paid support . I 've waited a LONG time to speak with a supervisor ... As I write this I 've been on the phone to MS for a full hour with no help at all . I 'm still on hold . Where will it end ? Oh ! 28 minutes into the call the line went dead . I guess that 's Microsoft 's commitment to customer service in action . Now I 'm on the phone to MS itself , via the corporate number I got from google finance . They 're concerned that the PID lacks digits , but they 've finally told me how to uninstall this . Total time on the phone was 1 hour and 22 minutes . Now to call Amazon to return this Chinese-made piece of junk ... UPDATE : Microsoft speculated that the mouse was counterfeit , owing to its not having a valid product ID number . So that 's fun . Returning the wretched thing to amazon turned out to be wonderfully simple . Would n't you like to know before you order what country these things are made in ? 	Mouse
Just as described , very sensitive scrolling and excellent range . A bit smaller than I first expected but have really grown to love it . 	Mouse
Ok , this is a great mouse , prob the best i have ever owned . It CAN track on glass and it does it well -LRB- i tested it -RRB- , but this is something i will never use . The mouse is very comfortable and rather on the large size , which is great for me and people with medium-large hands , but it kinda diminishes the portability of the mouse , thats ok though because it is portable enough as long as you dont cary your laptop and mouse in a sleeve like i see many people do . The usb dongle is very small and fairly noticeable -LRB- even on a mac -RRB- , you never have to take it out , the mouse has on\/off switch so , like most mice , you do n't need the dongle to turn the mouse off . It is rechargeable , but i have n't gotten the chance to test that yet . Overall , great mouse , very accurate and responsive , The software it comes with is great too -LRB- mac version online -RRB- . 	Mouse
Apparently , I am NOT the only person who thinks the M305 Wireless optical Mouse can create world peace , end poverty , homelessness , food shortages & excessive gas prices . I 'm writing this because any other manufacturer must use this as the basis for any design of a wireless mouse . Things to love : 1 -RRB- It 's Red 2 -RRB- It fits perfectly in hand 3 -RRB- The range of adjustment for sensitivity is ideal 4 -RRB- It 's Quiet , both : clicks & scrolls 5 -RRB- Perfect interface with both Windows XP Pro & Windows 7 Home Premium . 6 -RRB- The Nano receiver - ` nuff said about that . 7 -RRB- Wireless range is in excess of 6 feet - at home it 's over 10 feet . 8 -RRB- Price is under $ 20.00 US Dollars . Things to Hate : 1 -RRB- Ummmm . Ahhhh -LRB- ? -RRB- 2 -RRB- Oh ! It 's NOT endorsed by the United Nations , World Health Organization , the Centers for Disease Control , the CIA , FBI , NSA , FEMA or NASA . -LRB- However , some listed agencies can neither confirm nor deny the actual endorsement or lack thereof . -RRB- Any Questions ? Oh , try to buy just one . Really . I do n't know anyone who owns less than 2 , and most have more . Not being used in my house today : -LRB- 1 -RRB- MS wireless optical mouse and -LRB- 1 -RRB- no-name , no brand , red one that is sleek and also has a nano-reciever with a shorter range - $ 7.00 . -LRB- 4 -RRB- wired mice from really tiny & shiny to one UFO shaped object with a red beach ball in the center .

I did not like the mouse . It did not install on my mac OS1 .6 very well ; I got a message to call support . Like I 'm going to spend hours on the phone for a mouse . It must be used with a mice pad otherwise it does not slide easily . The scrolling and was too fast . IHMO , bluetooth is superior USB for mice . I knew that . Other vendors have a superior bluetooth solution . Why did I waste my money . 	Mouse
First of all , I use a Dell notebook with Windows XP not Mac OS . I have been using a Logitech V270 , which I like , for about two years . My wife has a Macbook Pro and the Mighty Mouse , both of which I liked a lot . : -RRB- But I can not have the Macbook Pro because of some software need . A few days ago , I found that I can connect the Mighty Mouse to my notebook -LRB- Dell Latitude D620 -RRB- and have all functions the V270 has . So today I got my own Mighty Mouse . V270 was a good mouse for its time , but the Mighty Mouse is significantly better : 1 . The Mighty Mouse is much more accurate than the V270 . The difference is very obvious -- with the V270 I may mis-click on right-click menu items . Sometimes I prefer to use my old Logitech wired optical mouse for its accuracy . The Mighty Mouse , however , is as accurate as a wired optical mouse if not better . 2 . The Mighty Mouse is lighter than V270 . The V270 is heavier without the batteries -LRB- as I feel -RRB- ; and it requires two AA batteries while the mighty mouse only needs one -LRB- though can use two -RRB- . I do find that Apple provides Lithium AA batteries with the Mighty Mouse . What a wise choice . I feel that a Lithium AA battery is only half the weight of an Alkaline battery . 3 . I like the shape of the Mighty Mouse . It is wide and flat , while the V270 is narrower and higher . It just feels better with the Mighty Mouse 's shape -LRB- but this is very personal -RRB- . I noticed that right click of the Mighty Mouse is not as decisive as the V270 , which is understandable because the Mighty Mouse has no left or right click buttons . I got used to it after a while . The left and right side buttons may work differently on Windows XP , but that I am not sure and it does n't matter in my use . 	Mouse
The Vespula is as good as they get . This pad is a great intermediate size . It fits well on the desk without consuming too much room , yet I never run out of room when moving the mouse . Works great for all games and mouse types . The wrist support is a good size and smooth on the skin . This mouse pad beat all my expectations ; so much , I 'm sure it will have a home on my desk for many years . Oh yeah , the firm design of the mousing surface screams durable while never moving or catching on my moving hand . LOVE IT . Not sure what I really think of the different mousing surfaces , been trying many different combos of mouse feet on each surface with different weights in the mouse -LRB- nice to have the customizing option -RRB- ... Indifferent : P still LOVE IT . 	Mouse
I bought this eight years ago with my first laptop to have something small and easy to pack . The size is great for portability , but is easy to use at the same time . The rubberized surface helps make it easier to hold , but it did soften and wear over time . The only issue I 've had was with the scroll wheel ... after a few months it started having trouble with fast scrolling . Its been through a lot over the years and still works ! Overall , I 've been happy with it . 	Mouse
we are very pleased with the Genius mouse pen . Got it as a Christmas gift and the time it arrived in was very professional . Thank you V Steadman 	Mouse
The scroll ball works very well but the tracking is a little off . That 's the only con , though . It 's very convenient and easy to connect . I use it with a 13 '' MacBook Pro and I can use it anywhere . It works on the laptop , my leg , the arm rest ... anywhere . 	Mouse
Apple mice have historically had their detractors , though I am not one of them . I actually liked the old Mighty Mouse for the most part , though I worried about the common complaint that the scroll ball on top of the mouse eventually gets gummed up and stops working . The Magic Mouse eliminates this problem by replacing the physical scroll ball with a touch-enabled surface and gesture support : instead of rolling a ball around to scroll , you now just swipe a finger over the solid surface on top of the mouse . Thus you 're still able to scroll in any direction , but the new mouse has one less moving part . I found that the touch scroll feature works well and it enables gesture and momentum-based capability not possible with a scroll ball or scroll wheel . Specifically , instead of repeatedly rolling a wheel or a ball to get to the bottom of a web page , the Magic Mouse lets you give a quick flick to `` throw '' the page until it hits the bottom or you tap to stop the scroll . It also enables you to , say , go back and forward in your web browsing history by swiping two fingers to the right or left . Overall my impression of the mouse is positive , but it has a few disadvantages to be aware of . For starters , the scrolling and swiping capability do n't work with Boot Camp if you 're using it to run Windows on your Mac . Also , I found the two-finger sideways swiping to be a bit awkward . In order for the swiping to work , the mouse must be stationary , which means you hold the mouse with your thumb and ring finger while swiping with your index and middle fingers . It 's doable , but it feels like you 're putting your hands through some contortions . As for gaming , this mouse , like the Mighty Mouse before it , lacks physical buttons which means there 's a risk that you 'll accidentally left-click at a critical moment requiring a right-click -LRB- which can accidentally fire a gunshot and give your position away in some games -RRB- . I doubt this will be a deal-breaker for most . Lastly , this mouse feels almost half the height of a normal mouse , so while I 'm used to feeling like I 'm resting a cupped hand over a mouse , this one feels almost as if you 're moving the mouse around with a flat palm . Apple certainly created a new experience with their innovative mouse ! It 's the first of its kind and it took some getting used to , but I like it overall . The question for buyers is if they are willing to cope with something so different -LRB- and fairly expensive -RRB- to be able to utilize the cool new features or if they are more comfortable with a conventional , familiar-styled mouse .

this optical mouse is very good for the price i paid . would recommend this for the price range . well constructed and shipped quickly 	Mouse
In a sentence , this is the Rolls Royce of mouses ... mice ... meese ... oh whatever . I read all of the reviews on Amazon and some other on-line Google-searched reviews . The ones here on Amazon , quite frankly , scared me . After-all this is not a cheap mouse . So , I am here to debunk all of you haters ! First , it 's NOT that heavy ! Second , the very first thing I tried to do was get it to `` jump '' like so many said it was prone to . I even went so far as to intentionally lift it off the mouse pad to see if there was a reset delay that caused the `` jumpy '' glitch reported . I am happy to report ... NONE ! It behaved just like any other mouse , well , you know what I mean . Third , I tested it with precision . Other sites argue that a wireless mouse , ANY wireless mouse , is not as precise as a USB connected one . Well , my tests were not scientific but they were for my needs . I compared only what I have - a generic USB rollerball , my old wireless rollerball & of course the Laser 1000 . I tried drawing circles in a paint program . The result ? the first two , no matter how hard I tried -LRB- without putting my artistic aptitude on the line here -RRB- always came out in squarish ovals . Not the MX1000 . It was the next best thing to an input pad and stylus . The final test will be in a first person shooter . Now , for you truth tellers . I DID feel it was moving way too fast when I first started using it , but apparently I was over compensating for the imprecision of my former mouse . I was able to balance and correct myself quickly . Honestly , this mouse just glides . It 's like driving a Lexus or a BMW for the first time after losing your '94 Saturn . What 's more , and what will be the most difficult learning curve for me , that I am excited , about is the amount of area available for left clicking . My index finger was amputated years ago and with a regular mouse only the top is available for clicking . This mouse allows for nearly full finger access . Now , I can relearn to use the remains of my finger like I used to . In conclusion , there are lots of input devices out there . Look around . But I guarantee you will NOT be disapointed if you make this mouse your final choice ! 	Mouse
Not sure why other people seem to be having issues with this charger . Took it out of the box , plugged it in , inserted the battery pack and placed mouse on charging pad . The mouse even worked after less than 15 minutes of charging . Blinking green light went solid after a few hours of charging . No issues , no problems . Check your imac power settings and do n't place this device on metal . 	Mouse
The mouse is very precise which is good for when you are playing games . Not have cords is very convenients . I found with previous mouses that the cord would get caught on my desk as it stretched from the tower . The mouse comes with two batteries and a receiver . This is convenient because while the one battery is charging the other is in the optical mouse . The battery lasts 1-2 days depending on how much you are using your computer . The mouse turns off if you do n't move it for awhile to save power . 	Mouse
Worthless if you have a Compaq laptop computer . I attempted to install the software for this mouse on my laptop . It crashed my computer , and disabled my touchpad . Thank goodness I had system restore make a restore point just before trying the install . <p> I bought a wireless mouse about 3 years ago , and wasnt impressed . Was talked into getting this mouse by a friend and I 'm still not impressed with wireless mice . I 'm returning mine tomorrow . 	Mouse
I think most of the reviews hit on all the good and bad points with this mouse . I just wanted to add that I 'm using it with an HP -LRB- Compaq -RRB- laptop with a very tiny -LRB- and inexpensive -RRB- Bluetooth transmitter\/receiver made by Azio . I went with this low profile Bluetooth dongle because it can stay plugged into the laptop all the time -LRB- the dongle that ships with this mouse sticks out at least 2 inches -RRB- . It syncs with the mouse without a problem and all the buttons \/ functions work great . The scroll wheel is super smooth . It 's a tad on the small size for someone with big hands . I loaded the Azio sofware first and then the mouse software . I purchased an OEM version of this mouse from an Amazon 3rd party retailer and got it for 29 bucks -LRB- about 20 less than what I see it now selling for -RRB- . 	Mouse
I 've been using this optical mouse with my laptop for about two months and I 've found it most satisfactory . This mouse has several things going for it . Firstly , it 's not as small as many other travel mice . The size is about 3\/4 that of a regular mouse , which I prefer . Makes my hand less sore . This little guy also has a scroll wheel . However , the niftiest thing about this mouse is the receiver . It fits into a slot on the underside of the mouse when you 're not using it , AND it breaks the battery circuit when in place . So your batter does n't run down when you 're not using the mouse , and you 're not likely to misplace the little receiver . It 's a little difficult to explain without seeing the set-up , but trust me : it 's clever , and it works well . 	Mouse
The mouse itself is perfect . If you have used the MX 1000 you know the feel of this one - highly accurate tracking and a nice smooth glide on virtually any surface . The scroll wheel in either manual or free-spin mode is the best I 've ever felt . The buttons are well placed and overall it fits perfectly in my hand . I 've been using it for 12 to 16 hours a day for the last two weeks and have no complaints on the ergonomics . My battery results seem more favorable then some - I can get around a week of constant use between recharges without any problems . However -LRB- based on using it in windows XP -RRB- : The drivers for this need to be scrapped and rebuilt from scratch . Although I do like the `` shifting '' aspect of the wheel between free-spin and manual mode , it becomes very annoying to have this automatically shift based on Logitech 's interpretation of which mode I want to use and when . I have disabled the smartShift option in setPoint but this typically only lasts for a given period of time and then I find that the automatic detection settings have come back and I am having to fight with the mouse all over again to get it to act right . Half the time , the free-spin option in certain applications simply does not work . You will get no response for vertical scrolling until you shift back into click mode . This is particularly annoying because it 's very easy to get used to keeping it in free spin mode because it is so convenient only to find that you often have to switch out of it to get the wheel to work at all . At other times , when I activate the free-spin mode , the scroll effect takes off like it 's on its own mission and just madly keeps scrolling up or down without responding to any clicks -LRB- left , right or on the wheel itself -RRB- until it has decided where to go on its own , anywhere between 3 to 5 seconds after I 've given up trying to stop it . The functionality of the horizontal scroll which was so useful in the MX 1000 has been cut off at the ankles . Even with the fastest possible setting in setpoint , I get no more then a few pixels of horizontal scrolling at a time . Sometimes it picks up speed and eventually gets across the screen , other times it just stays in molasses mode and I just resort to pulling on the window sliders instead . The application switcher -LRB- the thumb wheel -RRB- has inconsistent behavior . When activating it with the forward\/backward motion or by the thumb click , it will present the application list as expected , but when moving through the list there 's a random probability that it will interpret the scrolling process as a click and you 'll get whatever item is in the mouseover without selecting it . The workaround is not even using the forward\/back options of the wheel and only activating the application list with the thumb click , then left clicking on the document you want . I 'm going to continue using the mouse because the hardware is well designed and is the best I 've ever felt - five stars on this part no question . But the drivers for this have n't even reached the beta release stage and I 'm surprised that Logitech did n't do more testing on this . No more then one star on this aspect . Overall , this mouse does improve productivity , but you will need to adapt a part of you brain to it 's quirks so you can switch back and forth between what you need to do at what time to keep the mouse behaving correctly - not suggested for the typical user who just wants a well working mouse that does n't have issues . If you like driving stick-shift then you 've been initiated and will be able to accommodate to the personality on this thing ... Otherwise , I would check out the MX 1000 instead . 	Mouse
I 've been using a Microsoft mouse for a number of years and this was a major upgrade . I love this thing . the size is just right and the functions are awesome ! 	Mouse
Wish I would have bought this one sooner ! It 's a great mouse , very responsive , super easy to use . Love the shape as it fits my hand perfectly . I bought one of these for my desktop computer and I loved it so much that I immediately bought another one to travel with my laptop . The only reason I did n't give this mouse a 5-star rating is the battery usage . This mouse eats through batteries FAST ! If I leave it on all the time the battery -LRB- requires one AA battery -RRB- goes dead within a week . I 've learned to turn off the mouse when I 'm not using it so the battery lasts 10-12 days instead of 5-6 . Still a great mouse . I just need to invest in rechargeable batteries & a charger . 	Mouse
This is the best mouse ever . It has a great design and feels great in my hand . The positioning of all buttons are great . This mouse is so good I bought another for my other computer . The IntelliPoint software that comes with it is very easy to use and helps you customize your mouse to your tastes . I would reccommend this mouse to everyone and anyone . 	Mouse
I bought this mouse thinking I 'd probably end up replacing it with a more expensive Microsoft optical Intellimouse ... 20 bucks for an optical mouse , I figured it 'd probably make it 6 months and die on me . <p> It 's been almost 2 years ... I 'm still using my logitech optical 'cause it does everything I need it to ! It responds well , it 's comfortable to use , and I have n't had a days problem with it ! The scroll wheel also makes scanning webpages and lists a lot easier . <p> Also , the fact it comes with a PS\/2 adapter has saved me some grief -LRB- and more than a couple bucks -RRB- with my KVM switch -LRB- a switch that allows for multiple computers to hook up to one keyboard , mouse and keyboard -RRB- . <p> If you 're looking for a great little mouse that holds up really well , look no further ... you 've found it ! 	Mouse
Because of other reviews , I was worried about the color so I ordered two -- one aqua and one teal . The color of the teal solid keyboard is just as it appeared online ; however , the aqua is quite different . It is definitely more teal-blue than aqua in color . I do like the clear silicone look between the keys better than the solid teal cover . Both fit my Mac 13 '' very well . It adheres to the keyboard and I do n't even notice it as I type . It shipped fast and I will not hesitate to purchase from Topcase in the future . 	Mouse
Solid clicks and middle click . It was smooth and the curves are great . The mouse texture was also sleek and grippy . My only gripe is that my hand is , while average sized , unable to fit my index and pinky on the side of the mouse . It dissapoints me . But otherwise , it 's easy to install , and it works beautifully . 	Mouse
This mouse so far is pretty good for me . Pros : easy to use , great design , comforting handling Cons : it takes two AA batteries 	Mouse
"This basic scroll-mouse requires no setup , is very lightweight , but somewhat uncomfortably shaped . Also , it 's a pretty red color . It feels sensitive\/responsive in normal usage . For my average-sized male hands , the mouse is physically too small . I use a `` claw-grip '' to manipulate the mouse with the tips of my fingers , vs a palm-grip , and there 's not enough `` hump '' to rest the base of my hand , nor does flared front of the mouse give me a natural place for my fingers . I prefer the ergonomic shape of the older <ahref=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000HCRVUS/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/184-2160303-9589320""> Logitech VX Revolution </a> , which fits my hand nicely despite being about the same size . The VX was a more complex model with a much larger transceiver and is discontinued . A palm-grip male user would likely find both this mouse and the VX too small . but I suspect this mouse would fit my girlfriend 's hand nicely . The shape is symmetrical so should be ambidextrous . The `` Nano Receiver '' is tiny -LRB- a plus for laptop users -RRB- , but it would be nice if this mouse had the Unifying Receiver used by most of Logitech 's current mice , which is easier than trying to track which USB dongle goes with which mouse . The M310 uses 2.4 ghz , which has good range but is a crowded part of the spectrum -LRB- eg , Wi-Fi runs in the same range -RRB- . A bluetooth version would be nice , to do away with the receiver entirely , since bluetooth is standard issue on many laptops now . The upside of no extra buttons or features is no need for software , although Logitech 's support site indicates SetPoint 6 . x supports this mouse -LRB- it did n't show up in my older Setpoint4\/5 installations -RRB- . The downside of the simplicity is the lack of programmable buttons , such as back\/forward buttons and adjustable scroll , both of which I use heavily on all my other Logitech mice . The included AA battery is a nice touch , as is the easy-open package -LRB- no scissors required to open the plastic package , the back just peels off -RRB- . This is a solid mouse that performs its basic function well , but has no frills . Recommended for its target audience of small-handed users who do n't want complexity with their mice . But others may want to look elsewhere . "	Mouse
I was searching for a good ergonomic mouse that would n't aggrevate the arthritis in my index and little finger , and this one is working well . There are 4 different speeds for the pointer , which is nice . On a day when your hands really hurt , you can set it on high and barely have to touch the mouse to move it . There are also 2 browser back buttons controlled by the thumb , which helps limit movement of the other fingers . I adjusted to using this mouse in one work day , having chosen to ignore the naysayers who said it would be difficult to adjust to . The only thing I 'm still having to think about is the right click , which is the lowest of the 3 `` bars '' that you have to press . My little finger is n't strong enough to click on it , so I have to remember to use the next one . I 'm sure I 'll adjust to that fine in a few more days . To top it all off , it 's darn pretty ! 	Mouse
This is a really nice mouse , great speed , optics , range , feel ... But you 'll still have cords running to the computer . <p> I 've got a laptop and I hate plugging and unplugging cords all the time so I was looking for a truely wireless mouse , this is not it . <p> The base station , which is a reciever and charger , requires a cord from an outlet , then it another cord to the computer . Now , the mouse does n't have a cord physically attached , but the wires for the base station are enough to turn me off . <p> So buy it if you 've got a desktop , but not if you 've got a laptop . 	Mouse
It does what it should , and the price is right . Cord is very thin , so I see that as an issue over time . Cord is also very short , so if your usb port is on the wrong side , it can create some difficulties . 	Mouse
This is the best mouse pad I 've ever owned and beats all of the other expensive ergonomic mouse pads . The only downside is the if you carry this in your laptop bag it can get folded pretty easily . 	Mouse
If this mouse ever ends up breaking from over-use , I 'm DEFINITELY going to buy from you guys again . I ordered it two days ago at night -LRB- Thursday night -RRB- and got it today morning -LRB- Saturday -RRB- , not to mention the great price ! I did n't want the wireless mice because I 'd have to buy a separate battery from time to time and it 'd be a pain in the rear if I lost the connector . . so I wanted a USB connected mouse . It looks kind of small in the picture , but it 's about the size of my palm and it feels comfortable . The wire looks really sturdy and durable , so I doubt I 'll have problems with that . . : -RRB- Thank you so much ! I might order again soon just to stock up on them ! : -RRB- 	Mouse
My wrist pain is gone , but my mouse is unresponsive . I actually get better response off my wood desk than with this mouse pad . I solved the problem by cutting the mouse pad part off and just using the wrist pad with my old mouse pad . I do n't recommend this pad with an optical mouse . I can not give an opinion with a ball or laser mouse . Good luck . 	Mouse
The one thing that 's nice about Microsoft is that they 've finally learned to start taking customer suggestions . They were the first to design a pro-style right-hand only mouse , and props to them . The right-hand style means more comfort , less strain , and easier control access . If you 're right handed , of course . I can use this mouse for hours on end without any strain or discomfort . <p> The computer I have this mouse hooked up to is a Mac , and Microsoft 's Intellipoint software works well . Despite being USB Overdrive with a MS Logo and some options put on top , it 's surprisingly versatile and easy to use . The thumb buttons are useful for everything from web navigation to jump\/crouch in FPS games . The scroll wheel is a must-have for any long documents . <p> This product gets 5 stars from me for excellent comfort , good , through design , and superb function . 	Mouse
Like the title says , this is the best mouse I have ever purchased . I was a bit hesitant to spend $ 70 on a mouse but the features pulled me in and I was not disappointed . So far I have tried this out with Skyrim , Mass Effect 3 , Kingdoms of Amalur and Modern Warfare 2 . It makes switching weapons in MW2 and quickslots in Skyrim so much easier . I have yet to use the 2 extra buttons at the top left in a game , but I 'm sure I will eventually . The mouse has a rubberized matte feel to it and it feels great . I do n't lose grip unless I completely let go . There is also a nice rest for your ring finger that I like . And now the best part : the 12 buttons on the side . Be honest , this is why people buy this mouse . The keys work very nicely and are completely responsive . The only gripe I have is that I need to move my thumb down further than I 'd like to hit the bottom 2 rows , but I have been getting better with this . Pros -17 buttons , and all are responsive as can be - rubberized grip - moves nice and smoothly across my mouse pad - Razer software lets me turn the lights on or off , and lets me create multiple profiles for different key setups . - There is a switch on the bottom to let you choose the number key row at the top of your keyboard or the number pad . - Braided fabric around the cable . Might just be for looks but I like it . - comes with 2 stickers with the Razer logo , a quickstart guide , full guide , product guide and rubber adhesive pads for button placement for beginners . Cons - Might be too expensive for some people , although I do not regret spending $ 40 more than I was planning - Not the quietest mouse to click - You can switch the DPI settings -LRB- mouse sensitivity -RRB- , but only in the Razer program , not on the fly . Over all , this is a great mouse . I would definitely buy from Razer again , although I probably will never spend more than $ 70 on another mouse . But I also do n't think I could ever go back to a mouse with less buttons . 	Mouse
Very happy with the MX510 , if you use a large high-res screen , it makes all the difference in how far you have to move the mouse . MS Explorer mice cranked all the way up do n't even come close . Also highly recommended for gaming . 	Mouse
I have arthritis in my hands which makes working very difficult enough . It is hard to lift my fingers as it is , but this mouse , which came with my Microsoft Wireless Natural Desktop Pro keyboard\/mouse package -LRB- I got it for the keyboard only -RRB- is so tall that I continually found myself clicking buttons when I did n't want to . I had to hold my hand high enough in order to not accidentally click buttons , that my wrist became very strained and sore . I use it for baseball practice now : - -RRB- The mouse may work well for others , but if you have rheuumatic issues with your hands , this is not the mouse for you . Incidentally , I have been using the Logitech MX Revolution with much success and little pain . Best mouse I ever used . It may be called something slightly different now , but definately worth a look . 	Mouse
Bought this based on price -LRB- lower than comparable Kensington Orbit -RRB- and its stated reliability and ease of cleaning . Also purchased a Kensington Orbit for comparison and to select one or the other after some limited , personal trials . Decided on the Adesso myself , as described below , with the technique of use being different and the smooth ball of the Adesso a big factor . See below for details , and Bottom Line opinion comparing these two options . Like any Trackball , speaking as one having been accustomed to 8-10 hours per workday using a traditional mouse based on movement across a surface , there was a breaking-in period . During that time , I had to commit to which fingers to use for what activity , and how to get the most out of it while minimizing wrist strain . While I was trying to find a technique that worked for me , I happened to read that one Trackball manufacturer had recommended using the middle digits to move the Trackball , in a position where the hand hovers slightly above the mouse , instead of resting upon it , as you would reasonably assume , based on its shape . I added a wrist support -LRB- the Wrist Assist by Allsop , about $ 8-10 -RRB- and voila ! I can use the middle three digits , mainly the middle finger , to move the Adesso Trackball -LRB- seems better than using the thumb for that -RRB- . That leaves the index finger to click the left button and the ring finger to click the right button , and during the act of clicking the buttons , not disturbing the Trackball position , a big issue if your hand rests on the mouse all the time . What a difference ! I get very accurate positioning of the mouse that way without straining my wrist . I have not experienced any problem with the Adesso Trackball action , finding it very smooth and predictable . But the Orbit model I purchased has a much-less smooth Trackball , a major disappointment . Both the Orbit and the Adesso mouse have a removable Trackball for easy cleaning . Ease of installation for both can not be really improved upon as there is nothing to do but plug the Adesso or the Kensington Orbit into a USB Port , and I found that to be the case for both a Windows PC -LRB- Vista Ultimate or XP -RRB- and a Mac -LRB- OS X Ver 10.6.7 -RRB- . Neither came with any specific software to install , and that is a plus for me . Major disappointment for the Adesso : I do think the Adesso scroll action is a bit rough , and the duration is a bit short , compared with the Kensington Orbit with its excellent , smooth and quiet scroll ring , which is the best I have seen on any mouse . Overall , the Adesso mouse requires some kind of wrist or even forearm support before it shines , but it is great other than the scroll action . Interestingly , the Kensington Orbit comes with a wrist support , perhaps due to the same need I found with this Trackball mouse , however that wrist support provided along with the Orbit mouse did not work for me . The Kensington Orbit mouse body sits a bit lower than the Adesso , however its Trackball is more `` proud '' so the top of its Trackball is about the same height . That difference seemed to fall in favor of the Adesso for me , although if you want to use your thumb for the left button on the Kensington , I can see that working out fine . Due to that key difference in the digit used to click the left button , since I wanted to use the same mouse for my work computer and my home computer , I will not be keeping both . As I prefer the Adesso , I will be giving away the Kensington to a friend , and probably purchasing a second Adesso soon . Bottom line : You decide for yourself . But if you do a load of scrolling , and you do not mind using your thumb to click the left button , you will probably like the Kensington Orbit over this model . Technique aside , my feeling is that the Adesso quality is superior and it is less expensive to boot . I preferred the Adesso and will use it full-time now . 	Mouse
Add me to the list of unhappy users . Software would n't install correctly on my Toshiba Portege tablet . The Logitech software would n't remember settings . Unfter uninstalling and then running with standard XP drivers that problem was corrected but not all of the buttons worked . Even those that worked did n't work all on all applications . <p> 5 hours and 4 calls to Logitech technical support could n't correct the problem The techies tried to blame their `` competitor '' , Microsoft , and then blamed Toshiba . What 's the point of designing a mouse that wo n't work on an operating system that 95 % of the world uses ? <p> Very unhappy . Would n't buy Logitech again . I 'm writng this review using my Toshiba touchpad . 	Mouse
I love this mouse , feels great , cool new buttons for playing videos and music . Once again , Logitech pulls it off nicely . I used a MX500 for years and going to wireless was where I was headed . This was an excellent choose for me . Pro : - New buttons , making it easy to control music and videos at a distance . - Small and light . - Comes with USB Stick and USB extension cord for extra distance . - Includes batteries . - Works with iTunes , Windows Media , PowerDVD , Internet Explorer . - Came with $ 10 Musicmatch Card . Nice . - Pretty good distance . Using the USB stick on the back of my computer and it can still read from 6 feet away . Cons : - Back and Forward buttons . Maybe my MX500 spoiled me , but trying to find the buttons are kinda hard because they are leveled with the blue rubber part of the mouse making it hard know if you are pressing the back or forward . They are also so close together that you push them both at the same time . - The Back and Forward buttons does n't work with Firefox . The only way to make it work is to either turn off Logitech 's software , but that disables all the cool features of the mouse , or you can program it to work using keyboard commands . Oh , I did do a drivers update though . - Medialife is n't at all exciting . If I could , I would of giving this 4.5 stars . It 's great for people building a multimedia center with their computers . The new features can be buggy with some programs , like WinFAST TV , by accidentally pressing the Pause\/Play button , it disables the volume control . I just got the mouse in today , thanks to Amazon for the best service ! Just wish that logitech go back to selling their wireless keyboards separately ! 	Mouse
I have two problems with this trackball that might not bother others . First , the left button can not be programmed for a double click -LRB- which I am used to -RRB- and keep the right button as the usual right click . Kensington says one of the buttons must be `` click '' -LRB- single click -RRB- . I have verified this with Kensington tech support . Secondly , and less of an issue , as others have reported the hand position over the mouse makes it very easy to accidentaly right click with your little finger . An annoyance . 	Mouse
First off , I do n't own this product . I used it for ten minutes at a local store . So , anyway , here we go : When I used the MM -LRB- Mighty Mouse -RRB- , I thought that Apple had made another great product . After another few minutes , I became a bit disenchanted because the scroll ball was so hard to use . Other than that , I loved the mouse . It 's great that you can squeeze it to call up the Dashboard -LRB- default ; you can change what this does -RRB- and click the scroll ball to do something else -LRB- Spaces , maybe -RRB- . All in all , this is a great mouse and a good choice to buy for your Mac . 	Mouse
I bought this on Amazon for my office computer at work because I was sick of the wired Microsoft mouse that is not the most responsive one I have ever used . I have to say that I am blown away by this mouse thus far . For less then $ 9 , it is extremely responsive and accurate . I have had it for about a month now and it 's never been turned off , but the crappy batteries included are still going strong . It goes into an auto-sleep mode after some inactivity and just needs a `` click '' to get started . The page forward and back buttons are awesome . They work very well and save a lot of time when browsing heavily . I have not paid much attention to the adjustable DPI , as it is not something I normally adjust . As for the the connection , my tower in under my desk and the wireless connection to the computer is rock-solid . This is a really great mouse ! 	Mouse
: : Really big : : + Means you do n't have to worry about hand\/mouse sliding off of pad + Looks better 0 Might not fit on your desk , so research before hand , do n't complain that it does not . : : Smooth Cloth surface : : + Tracks better than my `` Razer '' brand mobile mouse pad . Although that may not say much , it is the only thing I can go off of . + Accurate , fast , but not out of the sake of control + Better than plastic surface in my opinion because it does not scratch and can fold to carry around + Better for your mouse - Does not track as well as the alum pads ? : : Thick : : + You can trust this wo n't fall apart over time : : Diablo 3 : : + Graphic looks 10x better in person , go for it if you like Diablo Well worth the money . I play starcraft 2 religiously and the tracking is great . MW3 feels good on it too . My accuracy went up a bit in MW3 , and misclicks down a bit in SC2 . 	Mouse
Wow , another great piece of hardware by Microsoft , you can not go wrong if you pick up this wireless mouse . Signal is strong , the mouse is very comfortable to use for hours upon hours , and the setup was a breeze . Yes , Logitech makes some nice keyboard\/mice , but I always seem to prefer Microsoft 's stuff . I do n't want to support Microsoft but I find their hardware to be more comfortable and better design goes into their products . You will not be disappointed if you pick up this mouse !!! \*\*\*\*\* HIGHLY RECOMMENDED 	Mouse
When I first got this item , I was so excited to open , and adjust this mouse to my personal liking . That is what the mouse is good for , it can extend into any type of angle and size . After adjusting , I installed the driver and software . It was very difficult to get this mouse to correspond correctly to the dpi settings , but eventually I got used to it . This mouse is very fragile , and turns out the mouse I got was defective , at many points during gameplay I would get stuck only able to move my cursor up and down and that was very frustrating . Overall I would n't buy this item . Go for a RAZER 	Mouse
I purchased three SP400 Smart-Pointers for a school setting . The instructors using this tool are very pleased with this device which allows them to remotely control all mouse functions , all PowerPoint presentation functions as well as on-screen presentations from anywhere within their classroom setting . The unit also contains a built-in laser pointer to assist in highlighting key points of a presentation . The staff loves the fact that the unit is small and lightweight design . The best part of all is that this tool is so easy to use on any desk or laptop computer - just plug it in and it work - no software is required . We are very pleased and hope to order more . -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 	Mouse
I have had this mouse for close to a year . It has worked very well . Works on most surfaces , I think I only have had a problem on a couple of surfaces like a fuzzy blanket . Much better than my old generic mouse which lasted less than a year . Art is nice , why have a boring mouse . Color looked just like it did on my monitor . I should also add I have dropped it on the floor a few times from desk height and it has survived . 	Mouse
Absolutely amazing mouse . BATTERY I purchased this mouse months ago , use the mouse for work , and still have not replaced the battery . SIZE This is a mid-size mouse , not too small , not too large . I feel that its the ideal size because it fits comfortably in the hand and at the same time is n't obnoxiously large or small TECHNOLOGY Uses infrared light instead of optical . Judging from my past experiences with non-infrared mice , I think this does improve the performance of the mouse . WIRELESS ADAPTER Fits nicely on the bottom of the mouse -LRB- clips on -RRB- . However , if you travel around a lot , the wireless USB adapter does tend to come off of the mouse . Normally this is n't a problem but with this mouse , when the USB adapter is removed from the bottom of the mouse , this activates the mouse . Its amazing that even with this occurring , the battery life STILL has n't run out on my mouse . Although a minor annoyance , I do n't that this little con would affect my decision to buy this mouse . CONCLUSION This is the best mouse I have ever owned . I am not a gamer and not sure how gamers would feel about it , but I have to say that compared to other mice , the response time on this is excellent , the fact that the scroll wheel scrolls up\/down AND LEFT\/RIGHT is very innovative , and this mouse is very affordable . The software that comes with the mouse is excellent as well , it also allows you to customize the left\/right scroll functionality as well as other qualities of the mouse . Logitech hit the nail on the head with this one . 	Mouse
i wanted a small muse i could take with me everyware and use anytime . i dont take the usb thingy out ever , and use it even more than i expected . i also like playing some small strategy games and it is perfect for it . 	Mouse
This mouse is a little different than I was expecting . I was expecting a red light and a black top . To my surprise , I got a gray top and a yellow stripe , which made me a little sad , but the optical light was blue . I guess in the end , the tradeoff is perfectly fine as the mouse is still pretty nice . I have n't used it much , but I will say that it is a little to flat at the top in my opinion . It does n't work with the natural curve of your hand to provide comfort and is very flat . I only used it on a desk and will say it is pretty sensitive and was slightly unresponsive , but this may change with more use and wwas nonexistent once I got used to the flatness of the mouse . It is a great mouse , especially for the price . Remember , Bluedeal gives you a blue optical light . I added pictures of the gray mouse in the photos of the product . 	Mouse
I am so glad I got the mouse to go with my Asus EE netbook . It makes navigation so much easier . 	Mouse
This was a gift for `` the man who has everything '' . Great idea and he loved it ... Until the mouse stopped working about 2 months after he got it . So now we have a wireless keyboard and our old standard wired mouse . I wo n't be buying Logitech again . 	Mouse
I bought several of these to go with basic computers I built for friends and students . I have never gotten a bad product from Logitech , and this one , even though inexpensive , lives up to their good reputation . Good Buy . 	Mouse
I bought this mouse with the hopes of being free from the cord tether . While it does give some degree of freedom , I found that the mouse must remain within about 18 '' of the receiver in order for it to work . Heck , my cord was longer than that ! A waste of good money . 	Mouse
Receive the mouse within about 4 days which was pretty nice considering it was free shipping Quality - Right now superb out of the box just plain sleek design the mouse is actually fairly big-medium ish some people may not like that as for clicking on this it feels like it responds faster that a regular mouse now this is referring to clicking response time . Reliability - So far i have n't had it long enough to say so that is why it remains at four stars . Software - Straight forward easy to use simply a breeze . Overall - The thing is solid you want a gaming mouse with precision and accuracy to achieve that 1ms advantage this thing will do it . I will keep you all updated if anything goes wrong ect . As of now i must say tho buy it for the price and what you get definatley worth it ! 	Mouse
I Bought the logitech M-305 mouse and I had it one mmonth and the battery died on me so I called logitech and they sent me a replacement mouse and it died after 3 weeks so I called Logitech and they sent me the logitech 310 ad I am useing it now . 	Mouse
I paired it up once with my wifes laptop and havent had to do it again since . Works like a charm ! 	Mouse
To keep this short and sweet , this is the best mouse I 've ever owned -LRB- and I 've owned a lot over the last 13 years -RRB- . It 's affordable , low profile , extremely accurate \/ responsive , and looks good . What more could you ask for ? If you 're thinking about buying this mouse , do n't hesitate . It 's worth every penny . 	Mouse
It 's cheap and works great . I 've dropped it a few times and it keeps on ticking . This was the cheapest wireless mouse I could find on Amazon . It works perfectly and is as of yet , indestructible ! Highly recommend it . 	Mouse
So I received mine a couple days ago . My buddy has has one of these for a good 6 years or so , and I was looking for a new gaming mouse pad so I figured I 'd pick one of these up . The only problem is , its missing probably the most important part . The plastic film type material that goes over the top that picks up the mouse movement is n't even on there ! All it is is the black material on top and its sorta of slick cardboard feeling . It wont pick up any mouse I use with it . I looked at my buddies and his has that thin plastic film type material on the top that picks up the mouse movement and response perfectly , and mine is missing that . VERY DISSAPOINTED !!! 	Mouse
I have n't used this in a long time , but having it at a desktop now I notice the wheel button is accidentally pressed all the time , there is not much of a `` click '' either . I would say it 's a 3.5 star because it does become annoying . 	Mouse
This is the best mouse I 've ever used . Microsoft seems to have released upgraded version of this mouse . The old one and the new one are different in terms of thier shape . I own the new one and the old one . I 've used the old one for more than a year , and as I carry it around too much with my laptop that it went dead . So I bought the new one . I love this shape even better and the wheel and the buttons feel just right and the size of it fits my hand . The performance is great . As I do programming , I need precision that can follow my quick movement , and this mouse meet my criteria . <p> I also own Wireless Explorer , but it did n't meet my criteria in terms of precision . If you do heavy work with your computer , this is the mouse you gotta get ! 	Mouse
I have had this mouse about 3-4 weeks . It works good except that it freezes mostly when my computer is asleep and when you awaken it . the mouse does n't respond . I have to manually shut down my computer and then restart and it is ok again . Very frustrating . Also sometime the roll bar does n't work . Certain web pages it will work and others wo n't . I have a MAC so i `` m not sure what the issue is . Rather disappointed . I 'll probably have to buy a different mouse . 	Mouse
I have to say that this is my first gaming mouse , but I love it . Awesome LED colors , great speed and responsiveness . The only issue i really had was with the button placement on the inside of the mouse . . but you can disable them anyway ! Great features . . great company , I 've used the mouse for several months now and still love it . 	Mouse
I love this mouse . It 's comfortable to hold , and has a nice grip to it . The 5 buttons come with software that is mac compatible , making this my favorite pointing device . 	Mouse
I was thrilled by the performance of this gadget for 3 weeks . Then it died . 	Mouse
This pad is ideal if you are a mouse user , it allows the mouse user -LRB- you -RRB- to use your mouse . This highly effective model comes in the color ` black ' which absorbs the maximum amount of heat from the sun . 	Mouse
i mean , i bougth this one only for iablo 3 -LRB- i dont play that crap anymore btw -RRB- but i fall in love with this mousee , can put 3 diferent profiles in it , and the most amazing thing is , it the perfect mouse for gamers like me , no lag -LRB- yes , no lag whit good battery of course -RRB- and also it came with the rechargeable battery so , no worries . you can actually change any button on the mouse as you like , ANY BUTTON ... seriously , if i want i can put my enter key on my mousse i can , or maybe the `` s '' or let see maybe i want one button to be my copy and paste . well my friends . you can . this mousse do anything and after you get your hands in this baby , all mousse gonna look like crap .

This is a perfect replacement for the mouse I had before . This is an excellent basic optical -LRB- no ball -RRB- wired USB mouse . It comes with an adapter for PS\/2 . It 's exactly as shown , new and in perfect condition with instructions and software . It 's just not in the commercial packaging . Arrived fast , cheep , and works great ! I would buy this mouse again without a second thought . 	Mouse
I was disappointed by this product , so much so that I went back to my old mouse . The cause of my low rating is not Logitech 's quality or design . Both are superb , as is typical for that company . For many people this mouse will be an excellent choice . However , I have to purchase a mouse , trackball or keyboard , and use it for a while to see if the ergonomics agree with me . Many items that look and feel superb in the store do n't work well for me in the long term . My verdict on this mouse : pain ... nerves tingling ... numbness . This was puzzling for me , since my experience with the predecessor of this mouse , the MX1000 , was excellent . Why the difference ? I have looked at both products and believe that the smaller size and the greater degree of curvature on the right front side are the critical design changes . This is likely to be a five-star mouse for someone with an x-small to small\/medium glove size . Those who wear a large or x-large glove size should look twice before buying the MX Revolution , perhaps investigating the new Logitech MX1100 before making a purchase . The MX 1100 is slightly larger than the MX1000 and significantly larger than the MX Revolution . It may be a better choice for people whose hand size falls in the top 1\/3 of the spectrum . 	Mouse
I owned a few mouse of different brand names logitech ones where the ones that chewed up batterys the slowest . Cheap mouse whit triple a battery would last just over a month on a set of battery first logitech about 6 month this one i have for tree month still going strong but i dont know if it will make it to logitech spec of 3 years i hope so but only time will tell 	Mouse
I love this product . I tend to have sensory issues and this makes typing very enjoyable . It stays perfectly on the keyboard without any adhesive and can be taken off easily . I love the color green and this green is really cute . I also purchased a green cover for my mac and now my mac looks really dope ! 	Mouse
The mouse works great with one flaw , a very short battery life . I use this mouse for work so there is no cost to me , but I would never recommend this to a pc user at home . The battery only lasts for 2\/3 months . 	Mouse
These mice are by far the smallest yet easiest to use when it comes to mini travel mice . Even for it 's small size , it has a very natural feel . I have large hands and still find this mouse comfortable to use . My computer instantly recognizes the mouse without any drivers , and when I mean instantly , I mean INSTANTLY . The only problem I 've had with these mice is the reliability of them . I 've gone through a couple already , each lasting only 6 - 12 months . In both cases , the left mouse button stopped working altogether or took a considerable amount of pressure -LRB- ie . not natural -RRB- . This is a 5-star mouse with a 2-star lifespan . 	Mouse
Pro : -LRB- 1 -RRB- The receiver is so small that you just leave it in the laptop . -LRB- 2 -RRB- All the range you need . -LRB- 3 -RRB- I 'm still on the first battery after three months . -LRB- 4 -RRB- Has a physical on-off switch on the underside of the mouse . -LRB- 5 -RRB- Tracks everything I 've used , including a fake sheepskin throw on my sofa . Con : Not referring just to this mouse , all wireless mice should be bluetooth , and bluetooth should be a standard feature built into all laptops . No external dongle should be required , not even the very tiny one that comes with this mouse . I do n't understand why the laptop industry has mostly failed to adopt bluetooth . Licensing fees too high ?? 	Mouse
I 've been using this mouse for about 9 months and I love it . When I first got it I would accidentally hit the scroll buttons and that was a bit annoying . But after just a few days I got used to the button placement . The mouse fits my hand very well and I would n't trade it for anything . I love that it 's wireless . The transmitter is very small works well . I have very rarely run down the battery . I plug it in to charge overnight about once a month . 	Mouse
Using it heavily now for 9 months , gaming and regular computer use , and having it accidentally dropped on the floor countless times , I 'm extremely pleased with this mouse . It 's not only sensitive and easy to use , but it 's sturdy and well made . Microsoft mice -LRB- mouses ? -RRB- never seem to last me more than 6 months at a time . This one is in for the long haul . I highly suggest it . The only drawback is the thumb keys can be a little awkward . It 's easy to hit the wrong key because they are so sensitive . But yet that sensitivity comes in handy while gaming . So you just have to be careful , or change the settings . 	Mouse
The computer mouse might have been designed to create stress and pain for wrists and fingers . The trackball is a great alternative . I use this one with a windows 7 64 bit setup . The included mouse software works well and allows for pointer movement settings different than those of the trackpad built into the desktop replacement laptop I use it on . The scroll ring does make a bit of noise when you use it , so not perfectly perfect , but worth it to dump the mechanical rodent ! 	Mouse
This is for the 2012 Naga MMO Gaming Mouse . It 's a lot smaller than it looked . Fits very nicely . At first it was hard to play with the thumb buttons , but Razer has included training tape bumps that can help you get use to it . It 's an overall great mouse . No problems . The biggest difference between the 2012 and original was the mouse adapters for players who would like to try palm vs claw style grips . It 's very nice to have and very durable when switching them out constantly . 	Mouse
this mouse works just fine . all the buttons are easy to get to and making my gaming expierence much more enjoyable 	Mouse
I love the gel rest part of this mousepad . My problem with this product is the mousepad surface is way too small . I find myself running off the edge alot and having to pickup the mouse and reset it . It is almost impossible to play any pc games with this . If all you use it for is web surfing and business applications I would recommend it . I have carpal tunnel syndrome and this gel rest feels great . If the mousepad surface was bigger i 'd give this 5 stars . 	Mouse
I bought this because my old MS Explorer model I 've used for about 10 years started acting up in software . When I got the Comfort Mouse I had a hard time getting used to it at first , but once you get the hang of it the speed and precision is amazing . If you gesture really fast you can traverse the whole screen -LRB- 1920x1080 in my case -RRB- in about an inch of hand movement , but if you move your hand deliberately slow the pointer slows up for more accurate movement . I thought this was the enhanced pointer precision feature , but it seems to have the functionality whether that is on or off , although there is some measure of difference between the movement when this feature is on and off . 	Mouse
Big fan of the crimson red mouse . I 'm a big mouse user , especially on laptops . This came prompt and was easy to `` install '' ! Also , for the small size , it is very comfortable on the hand . 	Mouse
This is the first time that I had used a wireless mouse , but I would never go back to using a corded mouse again ! My corded mouse would always get caught on something each time I used it . Thanks for the technology of today ! 	Mouse
I had the original wired mac mouse the last generation iMac . It worked flawlessly on my granite countertop . Apple then came out with a wireless version of the keyboard and mouse that I wanted which came with latest iMac . I had to have them . The keyboard works great and I just finally received the magic mouse and it does n't track barely at all on my granite countertop . I was forced to buy a mousepad which takes away from my countertop . I still love the design of the mouse and will use it but was really disapointed when it did n't move on the granite . 	Mouse
This was one of the best investements I have made for the computer . Up and running in a flash . Able to set up the different buttons to suit your needs . Bought it with windows me and since have windows xp . never had a problem with either operating system . Super Simple , a MUST . 	Mouse
This is a great mouse . Being left handed I have always felt left behind in the mouse category . This mouse fixes that . Only complain that i have is the software that comes with this mouse really screws it up . Please note that I am using this mouse on mac os 10.6 , so software could be fine on other systems , this is untested by me . Just plug it in and run with it and you will not be disappointed . 	Mouse
We bought this mouse for my preschooler to go with his new netbook . It is a perfect size for his small hand and he is able to navigate . It is an accurate mouse and the scroll wheel is a nice large size which you do n't otherwise find on the `` mini '' mice . 	Mouse
I 've always bought Logitech keyboard and mice in the past . The MK520 was purchased for my parents who have minimal needs so that they have less clutter at home . The build quality of the combo is as expected , but the performance -LRB- wireless -RRB- leaves something to be desired . Logitech claims its unifying receiver will automatically adjust to interference from wifi , but I don see it working too well . In a 4000 sq ft home , the router is placed near the side of the house in a closet -LRB- several walls away from the computer -RRB- , but the mouse and keyboard would constantly freeze during daily use . The computer is brand new with a clean install of Windows 7 OEM . I 've changed the wireless channel on the router to 11 and it helped the interference a bit , but my parents still experience regular lag and lockup on the mouse and keyboard . The desktop is only about 3 ft away , I 'd expected better signal transmission . In the same setting , if I plug my `` big '' receiver from the MX1100 into the computer , the MX1100 performs with absolutely zero problem . 	Mouse
I purchased this mouse as a replacement for my older wireless Apple Mighty Mouse . Upon initial use , the look and feel have been greatly improved and the slim design is more comfortable to use . The removal of the rubber center track ball is also a welcome improvement , as this was one of the failing components in the old mouse ; dust and contaminants would often clog the roller . The other nice feature that I like was the pure plug and play ability to quickly add this mouse via blue-tooth settings . I am currently running OS X 10.6.2 and this mouse did not require any special software or configuration to operate . Bonus ! Finally , the magic of this mouse is that it senses your finger movements and equates those to Left , Right , Scrolling , or zooming -LRB- when used in conjunction with the cntrl key -RRB- actions . This mouse is definitely worth the money and yet another ingenious product by Apple ! 	Mouse
Most people I know dislike , or simply can not use , one of these . I love it . If you have the manual dexterity to use one , then this is the best input device around . I wish they would come out with a mini bluetooth version for laptops . 	Mouse
I used the wireless mice -LRB- mouses ? -RRB- before , but this mouse is so easy to use . just plug it in and use it . and its easy to wrap up , although i just figured out that you clip the USB plug to the bottom : -RRB- . 	Mouse
I got the TiVo G USB to replace my aging linksys B adapter and to be able to run my wireless network in pure G mode . I did n't really try many other options since there are limited G adapters on the market that are known to work and certified by TiVo . I was hoping to get better reception , but after plugging this adapter to my TiVo Series 3 , the signal strength went down from `` Very Good '' on the linksys B to `` Good '' and sometimes `` Marginal '' with the TiVo G. I was a little disappointed to see that this pricey adapter has a weaker antenna than my 5 year old B adapter . I 'm typing this review from my laptop next to the adapter which is currently getting excellent signal strength . I would give this review a lower scale , but I understand that there are other G devices running in my unit and building where the B was probably by itself without much interference . Just to give you a background on my setup , I am running a Netgear WPN824 wireless router , Tivo Series 3 HD , and two laptops on pure G mode only . In addition to my wireless devices , there are 16 other wireless networks within range from other units in my building . For security I 'm running 128 WEP + MAC address access control list to make sure that only my devices can connect to my router . So out of 5 starts , -1 for antenna performance , -1 for lack of WPA support and price . Do n't let my review discourage anyone because there are many satisfied customers . I am just trying to be realistic based on my experience . I still love it and do n't intend to return the product because it looks nice and I 'm actually planning on repositioning my wireless router . 	Network Adapter
Also , the tech support is not very good . Read the forums ! I would just buy another product , and I am ready to junk my unit . 	Network Adapter
Solved the size issue I had with the previous adapter , but did not `` plug and play '' in Ubuntu . Worked find in Windows 7 . 	Network Adapter
I 'm on a G3 ibook and never thought I could get in on the wifi fun w\/o spending a fortune on an airport card . This little gadget has solved all my problems and it only took 10 minutes to set up . If you 're on OSX panther or tiger , refer to the review `` Attention mac users '' for complete and easy set-up instructions . Do n't bother reading the enclosed instructions or inserting the setup CD . Just download the driver and voila , you 'll be up and running in no time . I have not encountered one single problem in the 2 weeks that I 've used this product . My only complaint is that I had to go to the Amazon review page to figure out how to make it work on my mac . So I 'd have to say that Belkin tech support is pretty awful . They do n't even mention the fact that their product works on a mac . If you 're looking for an affordable way to get wifi on your ibook , I 'd highly recommend this product . Why should we be left out on the fun ! 	Network Adapter
I purchased 3 TiVo Series 3 DVR 's for my 3 level townhouse and these TiVo AG0100 Wireless G USB Network Adapters pick up and transmit the signal without fault . I love these adapters . 	Network Adapter
I 've had this unit for more than 6 months , and here 's what I 've learned : It works far beyond my expectations . I am able to bring in a strong wifi signal from over 600 yards away `` line of sight '' . Here 's what you need to know : the flat-panel antenna works great , aim the alfa logo on the antenna towards your wifi source as best you can . Also , keep in mind that the body of the unit is also a strong antenna , meaning that if you are going to stick it on a window , forget the suction-cup mount , and tape the entire unit flat against the window with the bottom of the unit facing towards your wifi source as best you can . If you 're not attaching it to a window , find a way to `` prop it up '' so that the bottom of the unit and the flat-panel antenna are both facing your wifi source . Doing those things can make the difference between a so-so download speed and a ripping-fast download speed . This thing rocks . Buy it and forget all the other junk out there . 	Network Adapter
The adapter works fine on Win XP . When installed on another system , such as win 2003 , the Wireless Network Monitoring software will not work , which will give the `` Can not Load Res_dll '' error message . The adapter itself works fine on Win 2003 , you need only to bear that sticky message that keep coming up every 10 seconds , or you can leave it on the desktop and ignore it . Linksys , please make a update to the driver for users of newer editions of windows , thanks . 	Network Adapter
Ok , I agree the little flap is a bit rickety , but if you 're going to use it for Tivo -LRB- like me -RRB- then you 're going to set it up once and then it 's going to be sitting behind your Tivo for a year or more . So as long as you 're somewhat careful -LRB- it is , after all , a piece of technology , not a football -RRB- then it will work fine for you . I 've had mine for over a year now , and I 've changed my configuration a few times with no problems . And by the way , mine is a version 2.0 and worked flawlessly with Tivo ! For the price , a good product ! 	Network Adapter
Easy to install and working , but erratic . From time to time , it loses wireless signal . Experimented and found out that I have to unplug and plug the adapter each time to get back the signal . 	Network Adapter
This is a great inexpensive switch ! I share an ADSL connection with my roomates , but the modem\/router we have only has a 4-port hub built into it limited to 10Mbps . All I had to do was plug the computers into this switch , and the switch into one of the router 's ports . Everything works just the same , and now we have a switched 100Mbps internal network , with room for more computers -LRB- and a free ethernet card to boot -RRB- ! The `` Auto-sense Crossover ports '' in this switch make networking a breeze . I do n't know why their other model -LRB- PN828ES -RRB- retails for so much more just because it has an uplink port . 	Network Adapter
This is a great adapter for your TiVo . I was using another adapter for my 2 Tivo 's one from DLINK and one from LINKSYS . I thought I was happy with my internet connection . After buying a TiVo adapter I was shocked it was @ 2 or 3 times as fast as my old ones . I immediately bought one for all of my TiVo 's . Great price too ! 	Network Adapter
I wanted to tap into the neighbor 's wifi connection about 100 yards down the street . Before I bought this Alfa product , I could only get access by taking my laptop out to my driveway . Now I am in my living room with 4 bars out of 5 typing this review . Speedtest.net shows me downloading at 2.54 Mbps and uploading at 1.06 Mbps . Installation was cake . I just plugged the Alfa into my USB port . Windows 7 automatically installed the drivers , and I was running within about half a minute . 	Network Adapter
Not only does this card work with Windows 7 , it works flawlessly with Linux as well . Installed it in a six year old Dell desktop and even though it comes with an installation CD , I did n't need it . Windows recognized it right off the bat , downloaded\/installed the driver automatically and was up and running in less than a minute . Same story with Linux -LRB- Ubuntu 11.4 -RRB- ; it recognized the card , automatically adjusted for it and was downloading data literally in seconds -LRB- I have a dual boot configuration -RRB- . I was using a wired cable connection before this -LRB- going thru a Netgear N600 router -RRB- and was averaging 50 Mbs\/second . There was absolutely no reduction in speed whatsoever which lays to rest the myth that wired connections are faster than wireless . You ca n't go wrong purchasing this product ! 	Network Adapter
Quick setup , and I never have to worry about up-to-date info again ! HAHAHAHAHA 	Network Adapter
Okay , so I bought this product , and of course , I did n't check these reviews . Silly me . First off , I do n't really have any problem with the adapter . Do n't use their software , just enable Windows Zero Config -LRB- XP -RRB- . Second off , my signal strength seems decent -LRB- 2 of 5 bars -RRB- for the distance I am connecting from . Two walls and a driveway separate me from the router . -LRB- No , I am not stealing internet , it 's my landlords router , he said it was okay . -RRB- Third off , when I try to connect the second adapter to the second computer , they both go screwy . Connected at first , then disconnected , tried again , immediate disconnect , then that pretty little green LED light stops working all together . Fourth off , do n't even bother calling their tech support . I saw someone saying in a review that they do n't speak English . They do , just poorly . Eventually , after trying to understand what this guy said , I just said , `` Umm ... Yeah ... I 'll try that ... bye . '' So , to sum up , do n't buy it . Buy something else . You 'll thank me later . 	Network Adapter
This wireless adapter truly is plug and play . After simply plugging the usb device into the back of the TIVO the setup screen immediately appeared on the TV . Within a couple minutes I was up and running with no problems . My only issue is not really with the device , but that TIVO has made their HD boxes to only work with this wireless adapter instead of allowing for the use of less expensive 3rd party adapters . 	Network Adapter
I ordered this item with no previous experience with wifi boosters and not really knowing what to expect . The item does what I wanted , which was to boost the signal strength of the wifi connection at work . It does that and I am able to connect to the internet with no drops while connected . It also found several other wifi spots , one or two with a little stronger signal , but the signal at work still seemed more reliable overall . The connection is still slower at peak usage times , but after midnight is quite fast and the important thing for me is that I am able to get on the internet and stay connected which I was n't able to do previously . It came with the long , larger antenna which I have used , but where I 'm at , I ca n't tell that it increases the signal strength any more than the shorter antenna , or that it finds any more wifi connections than the shorter antenna . That may just depend on where you 're at and how many wifi spots are available . I work in a smaller town and there may not be that many wifi spots available . I also work in an office with no windows , so that may also affect it . This came with a fairly short and thin connecting cable which does work and reaches from where I have clipped the unit to my computer to the USB port , but I did get the longer Amazon cable and it is a larger , better quality cable and the extra length does come in handy occasionally . You can plug the unit directly into your USB port , but it is heavy and needs to be supported to keep from eventually damaging one , or both of the USB connectors . Very pleased with the item over all and would order again , but I might try one of the larger units just to compare . I really like the smaller size of this unit however and the larger units probably would n't work any better . 	Network Adapter
Connected to Linksys WRT-54 wireless ruouter . installed on Window 7 running on AMD Phenom II quad CPU . Installation is very quick and easy . Considering another unit for other computer currently connected as wired . Signal is always strong even when antenna is not line of sight from the wireless router 's antenna . I like its robustness or reliability . 	Network Adapter
Fast , no issues with set up , nice range . Did the job , no complaints , purchased as a backup for my wired Motherboard -LRB- Sabertooth Z77 does not come with wifi -RRB- . I run my case very hot , and the card is next to two SLI graphics cards I also run very hot . Even so , no issues . Overall an ` A ' for doing the job perfectly despite high temps . 	Network Adapter
Do n't buy this ! It 's a waste of money ! It almost sort of works . The large antenna does not fit the USB adapter base , and the software is junk . 	Network Adapter
The box say that it works with linux but I ca n't find linux driver downloads anywhere . I can only find Windows drivers . 	Network Adapter
I have an older laptop that the WiFi went out on . I was hesitant to purchase this due to it 's low price under $ 13.00 but I figured worst case , I only blew $ 13.00 on it . I received it quickly and arrived new in a retail package . Install was easy and it works great . 	Network Adapter
I bought this product , recieved it the next day as planned but when I opened the box the card that was in there was an incorrect card . Instead of a 10\/1000 there was a plain old 10\/100 . I called customer service they replaced it and sent me a new one . When I got the new one it was the SAME THING a 10\/100 card in a box labled 10\/1000 !!! I called again told them the situation and you know what ?? They said that there was nothing else that they could do about it so they refunded my money . You would think they cared about the fact that the cards that are in the G boxes are the wrong cards ... I guess not ... ALWAY MAKE SURE THE PART # ON THE OUTSIDE MATCH THE PART THAT IS IN THE BOX !!! I GAVE UP AND BOUGHT IT SOMEWHERE ELSE . 	Network Adapter
I bought this product specifically for use with my new TiVo Premiere , but before setting up the Premiere , I connected it to my TiVo Series 2 to sync my Season Pass Manager with the web . Within 5 minutes I had the wireless network up and running on my Series 2 . It worked great ! And then once I had the information transferred , I connected it to my TiVo Premiere and it 's working terrifically ! The instructions offer pictures for assistance in set-up . No complaints !

I get a lot of asus products but i do not know what happen to this wifi adapter . The card does not keep a constant connection jumping around from 90 % and 30 % . I even used ralink and asus drivers to see if this was the problem but it was not . When i download something is jump from 400KB to 150 KB it does not even reach my maximum download speed of 650 KB which my netgear usb adapter could do in a breeze . If you do casual browsing i guess this will be proficient but for streaming , gaming , downloading it will not work . 	Network Adapter
Not much to say . You just plug it in and it works . Simple to set up and use . I recently upgraded my Tivo to a HD Series III . I was dissappointed that I could not use the network adapter that I previously used with my older Series II Tivo . The newer Tivo support for network adapters are limited . 	Network Adapter
A wonderfully useful accessory to your Tivo . It 's easy to set up and adds loads of functionality to your system . I run two Tivos , have a wireless G on both . I enjoy programming the Tivos from the office when I hear about something that I might like to watch , and it 's convenient to be able to shift movies from the Tivo to my laptop , or from one Tivo to the other . As I said earlier , a `` very useful accessory '' . 	Network Adapter
Being a retired person and not knowing about these things as young people do , I checked around and found that `` Links '' Router 's and adapter 's are the way to go . I found that are very good but the `` Start up disk '' for the router and the adapter did not work on my computer as I could not configure using the disk , I had to set it to manual setting and go where no amateur should go , it took a little time and now I know more then I wanted to know about these thing 's . Working great and yes it was worth the time to manual configure , on the router disk make sure also download the `` Linksys Easy Advisor '' make 's set up mush easier . -LRB- after you read it twice -RRB- Also helpful for the adapter .

Hello : I was looking for the capability of going Wireless while on travel . A Mac salesman at third party Mac Dealer recommended their item , it was not compatible with my Modem , the 2nd one recommended was the HawKing HWUG1 . I bought it , supposed to be compatible with PC & Mac . First problem I had the supplied compatible DVD would not load on my Powerbook G4 . Called Tech Support , given a site to D\/L a Driver . This was only driver and no User Instructions . I am well established with my Mac system and computers , however networking is a different animal . I need more help to set it up properly . It took many E-mails until they realized that I could not load their DVD and needed simple instructions on what I needed to put in the boxes . They were very friendly and polite to me during this frustrating event . I never did get an answer or reason for the incompatible Disk . I still am looking forward to going out somewhere to see if it will perform on the road ! ! My experience with Amazon has been great and this event has no reflection on my purchase now or in the future . 	Network Adapter
Our laptop network card went out while on vacation . We ordered this product because we needed an alternative way to access the internet -LRB- wireless not available -RRB- . The item arrived without a CD or drivers -LRB- the picture on Amazon shows a mini-CD included -RRB- . Windows XP did not recognize the device and the device has a sticker on it that tells you to go online and download the drivers from their website . Unfortunately , without the proper drivers , we were not able to get online . Not sure how you can sell a product that allows you to connect to the internet and not include the drivers necessary for device to function ; then tells you to connect to the internet and download the drivers . The cost to produce a mini-CD is very minimal and with the price for this device , it should have been included . -------------------------- UPDATE : After a friendly response from the company , I did indeed find the included CD with the drivers I needed . I have changed my rating for this product to co-inside with the finding of the CD . The confusion came because the package itself is very efficiently packaged , with no mention of the CD . The adapter has a sticker on it that instructs you to go to their website to download the drivers . I appreciate the quick response from their customer service department . I would recommend either removing the sticker from the adapter or putting a picture of the CD on the front of the packaging . 	Network Adapter
Fast shipping and very easy install . Tivo was working within 5 minutes . Have my cable guy to thank for suggesting I purchase thru Amazon . 	Network Adapter
I am extremely happy with this product . Simple install , just plugged into USB port of TIVO , it recognized it immediately and brought up the network menus . I selected WPA2 -LRB- yes , it supports both WPA and WPA2 -RRB- put in the info and downloaded a movie from Amazon Unbox ! Sweet ! 	Network Adapter
Easy to install and no problems connecting to my home network . Speed is a little slow and rarely gets above 36kbps compared to the 56kbps advertised . Fine for email and internet surfing but not so good for online gaming . 	Network Adapter
Careful to put the adaptor at a high place like on top of your desk hutch . Do the same for the wireless access point . It makes a much better signal . 	Network Adapter
200av kit at Best Buy for 129.99 , Amazon had the 500av for the same price , so I ordered it . Setup was a total breeze , plugged it in and it worked . It gave me a good solid connection , from my router up stairs to my den down stairs where I had a dead spot in my WiFi . This is about 25 % faster than the 200av so not as fast as advertised but faster than the 200v not to mention there are many variables to get top speed from your ISP , power lines etc. . I was able to stream 1080p , Planet Earth , HBO Rome , Tron etc. all worked great on it . It is faster than the 200av , it beats WiFi . The one negative I noticed on the 500av adapters gets much hotter than the 200av adapters . Bottom Line : It works , solid speeds , enough for 1080p streaming , great product and alternative for WiFi . 	Network Adapter
Although this device is a very nifty idea , since this device is only written to the USB 1.1 standard , its top transfer speed will be 12Mbps , which is will only give you 2Mbps more throughput when connected to a 100Mbps network , so beware of that . If it was USB 2.0 , then it could more than handle the 100Mbps speed . 	Network Adapter
I 'm not a novice when it comes to computers , so I was relieved to see that others had the same problems . Despite Linksys claims to the contrary - the XP drivers they supply do not work -LRB- at least not for me or the others on this review page -RRB- . What was very disappointing was the documentation for the product -LRB- the troubleshooting section has words in it - however the words are not related to troubleshooting -RRB- . Also phone support was terrible . I waited over 1\/2 hour two nights in a row before giving up . Do n't waste your time or money . 	Network Adapter
Bought 3 of these bad boys for my roommates , fiancees and mine computers . They worked great . Easy to install and work flawlessy , even with heavy loads of uploading massive graphical files and things of that nature . They are all different computers with different components . The one is a dell and the others were built by myself with optimal components at the time ... These work fantastic ... MUST BUY ! 	Network Adapter
My reason for getting this device was to improve speed to avoid choppiness in video transmission to an older laptop . My fatal flaw was in assuming that a wireless N device would be able to operate in the 5 ghz band and the 2.5 ghz band , just like my wireless N router . After much aggravation I determined that this device only works in the 2.5 ghz band . That band has problems because of other wireless networks in the neighborhood , and really does not offer much advantage over the wireless g card in my mac laptop , although there seems to be a slight speed improvement . On the plus side , this device does have a big power advantage over the wireless g in the laptop , and can pick up many more wireless networks in the neighborhood very reliably . It also connects fairly strongly to my network , which can have problems in certain parts of the house using the internal laptop network card . So there seems to be a definite range improvement . As my laptop is a G4 mac Powerbook -LRB- OS 10.5.8 -RRB- , I am a bit disappointed with the software integration of this device with the Mac OS . Even with the latest version of the ralink software , it is not seamless integration like you would expect with a Mac . A stumbler type utility pops up in the finder , and is difficult to get rid of . While it is useful and interesting info for me , other members of my family -LRB- kids -RRB- are likely to have problems with it . Also , I can not use network login when the device is active , and can only use local accounts on the machine -- which is not likely to be a problem for those that do n't have a mac server in their house . All in all , the device does what it is supposed to , although the software is mediocre and requires some technical savvy to get it all working -LRB- on a mac -RRB- . I am a bit disappointed in that it does n't do what I wanted it to do , so I am going to try the Alfa dual band wireless n device . 	Network Adapter
Excellent unit . Boosted signal and no longer have the reception worry . Much better than the original Linksys adapter . Ordered from Amazon.com and received very quickly . Must say I 've received very fast service on every order placed there . 	Network Adapter
We had 1 Tivo Premere DVR and it was time to get a second one . I bought it and then ordered this item . When it arrived , I hooked it up quickly and with no problems . Using this allows us to tape a show on one Tivo box and then transfer it to the other box for viewing in our choice of rooms . Great product ! 	Network Adapter
I needed more speed on my network . I run a home based business and have 8 computers on the network . The computers could handle a large amount of data quickly . The standard speed switches I had could only operate at 10\/100 . I looked into and purchased two Gigabit Switches -LRB- 16 and 5 ports -RRB- . I also purchased the corresponding network adapter cards -LRB- that 's a no brainer -RRB- . It was one of the best technology investments I made in 2006 . 	Network Adapter
Excellent addition to Tivo . If you have more than one Tivo box , you can transfer recordings from one box to the other . You also have access to games and movies to rent or buy . 	Network Adapter
This device works great with my older windows 2000 computer . Thought this computer was a goner , but since I have this , I can now connect to the internet again , and update , and now my kiddos have a computer for themselves . 	Network Adapter
I was getting weak signal from my landlord 's bar , so I bought this because of the reviews , hoping it 'll boost the signals from his free wifi a block away . But it did n't even work , none of the drivers worked . I downloaded 036NEH . exe from the website and it did n't work I tried it from the disc and it did n't work I tried contacting alfa and never got any help . I 'm using a Dell with window 7 64bit . I think the problem is it 's not compatible with 64 bit systems After a few hours I just decided to return this thing 	Network Adapter
This is the same alfa card that I have purchased many times , but this is a nicer setup than most . This includes the larger 9dBi and the 5dBi antenna . Further , it also includes a plastic mount for a few different applications as well as a very nice zipper storage pouch . The same alfa card is available in many kits , but this is a very nice kit . If you have use for the higher gain antenna , the additional accessories are nice . I will order again . 	Network Adapter
Nothing bad to say about this product . It 's simple to install and works great out of the box . Small and out-of-the-way , it nicely complements the TiVo and delivers much faster network speeds than the 802.11 b adapters some users may still have . 	Network Adapter
The Tivo wireless adapter installed seamlessly and quickly and works perfectly . As a result I was able to cancel my landline phone and save $ 25 every month . Plus , now I can download movies straight to my Tivo box . I love it ! 	Network Adapter
Had serious connectvity issues prior to purchase in a large wi-fi challenged house . Went from 1 sometimes bar reception to full bars as soon as we connected it to the laptop . Awesome product !! 	Network Adapter
The site did not state the version of the software . TiVo can only use version 2.6 or 2.8 and some 3.0 . This is version 4.1 and will not work on TiVo . I wish the site had listed what version it was before I ordered . 	Network Adapter
I bought this because it 's one of the few -LRB- only ? -RRB- wi-fi adapters that will work my old Power Mac G3 . <p> So far I 'm very pleased . It 's very small - almost as small as a pack of cigarettes . It 's also USB-powered , so no power cord to worry about , although you ca n't plug it into a non-powered hub or a keyboard . Not a problem for me . The Mac OS X -LRB- 10.2 -RRB- driver utility is simple and works great . It seems to have good range ; it gets full strength with my Microsoft router 50 feet away -LRB- through a couple walls -RRB- . It can lie flat or wall-mount , which is nice . <p> Handy tip : if you happen to have an Ikea `` Jerker '' computer table , the wall-mount holes on this unit line up perfectly with the holes in the desk 's vertical beams . It 's a handy place to mount it , where it can be up high and not take up any desk space . 	Network Adapter
I purchased this when ASUS came out with the update to the Transformer Prime to allow the use of an USB to Ethernet Adapter . I have the keyboard docking station . I shut down the Transformer Prime . Plugged it in , turned it on and it recognized the adapter . Works great . Thank you Plugable . Make sure you turn off the WIFI adapter , or you might be connected to WIFI . 	Network Adapter
I knew this was an excellent product when I first saw come out about 2-3 years ago ; and had my heart set on it when I 'd need a Wi-Fi card . No real problems have arisen with it , just a little snafew with the vendor , Tech For Less . They originally sent me an Orinoco 11b USB Gold Wi-Fi adapter . They did rectify the situation rapidly though ; by the following Wed. . I had the correct product . However , I had to send the wrong one back with RTS label they setup for me . All is well now .

Use this above any other generic adapter - it 's cheap on Amazon and it does a great job interfacing with the Tivo ! 	Network Adapter
I purchased this item to try to increase performance on my Toshiba laptop . I have to use it on the fringe of the wireless range . The built-in wireless card connects but is weak and drops frequently . This adapter was not as good as my built-in , and when I connected the recommended external antenna the signal dropped even more . When I contacted the mfgr by email , I was ignored . I am off this company altogether . Next time I will stick with Belkin or Linksys . 	Network Adapter
This has increased my transfer speeds for streaming many different things . The setup was difficult . 	Network Adapter
The product works as expected on an old Windows XP machine we set up for the kids . -LRB- Once I downloaded the necessary drivers -RRB- . Product has a `` cheap '' feel to it and is n't 100 % snug in the USB port . However , it works and works reliably . I had a few issues the first day - but I got the latest drivers and now it works like a charm . Never had a problem - and despite the usb plug not being 100 % snug - the kids have n't managed to knock it out yet . If you want something cheap that works - this does . 	Network Adapter
We bought one of these for a Sony Viao desktop that we were moving into the living room and one for a Sony laptop because it 's wireless card stopped functioning . For the desktop , we had a few minor difficulties . The signal was so low that once I tried removing it from the rear of the PC to put in the front it would n't recognize it again . I had to uninstall the software and re-install to get it to work . No biggie , and it was a bit glitchy , but once it was set up it worked great . For the laptop ... it has driven my husband to the brink of insanity . It wo n't recognize the unit , he tries to uninstall the software and it locks up and then he has to manually go in an find and delete the files . After no less than 5 tries he still ca n't get it to work , much less recognize the wireless network that is feet away . He ended up just giving up and buying CAT wire to plug directly into the modem , which of course defeats the purpose of wireless mobility , but at least he is n't packing his bags for the funny farm ! So one worked great in the end , with some work , and the other did n't work no matter what . I installed the the working one and he would n't let me help with his , so maybe it is user error . So , all in all , if you get it installed and recognized right away , it is a great product . If you do n't it will make you want to smash it with a hammer . So this may not be the best review , but it is honest . 	Network Adapter
After 2 days of reconfiguring my network -LRB- Linksys 802.11 B\/G router -RRB- in every way imaginable & getting no connection from the TiVo with this adapter , I searched the messageboards and discovered this adapter is `` tempermental '' with a combined 802.11 b\/g router . The TiVo site recomends it , but no one mentioned router compatibility ... get the WUSB12 model - worked like a charm in 3 minutes . 	Network Adapter
I had a 64 bit install of Windows Server 2003 and had a lot of problems finding a network card that would work for a 64 bit OS . This one works great . No significant install problems either . Great company , great product . I highly recommend it . 	Network Adapter
The Linksys WUSB11 is a singularly unassuming-looking device , but it actually works very well . Since it is not a USB 2.0 device , even if you get an 11Mbps connection - unlikely if you have even one wall between you and the AP , even a Linksys AP like the WAP11 - you will not be able to fully exploit that connection . On significantly older systems , like my K6\/2 300MHz test system , the connection is quite slow , as the machine just ca n't quite keep up with the load from the USB controller . <p> On my Windows 98 and XP systems the device worked quite well , but I had only limited success with the device under linux . The primary driver does not play well with SMP , so those users with SMP turned on in the kernel for whatever reason will not be able to use it . The alternate driver does not support most of the extended status information , and as such is not able to roam well between APs . 	Network Adapter
This wireless adapter is a waste of money . It is VERY hard to install it , if not almost impossible if you have n't the driver CD -LRB- the drivers from the internet are even worse -RRB- . But once you have installed it you will soon find out that the connection is very unstable ... well , my body is able to establish a better connection than this thing . Do n't buy it . It is worthless . 	Network Adapter
My old eMachines T1150 has no built-in NIC . Two cheap 10\/100 NICs were not recognized by Solaris 10 x86 -LRB- actually , Solaris Nevada b69 -RRB- . I finally decide to buy the Intel PWLA8391GT PRO\/1000 GT PCI NIC since I read it used the Solaris e1000g driver . Sure enough , it worked for me . My PC has a 1.3 GHz Celeron , 384MB RAM , and two 40GB 5400 RPM disks , so the throughput on the NIC is probably limited by the hardware around it . Thought I 'd pass this info along in case there are Solaris folks out there looking for compatible PCI NICs . I believe there 's a PCIe version available too . 	Network Adapter
After getting fed up with buggy ndiswrapper and the horribly low-performing bcm43xx driver with bcm43xx-fwcutter , I bought this to replace the stock Broadcom 4306 that came in this Latitude D600 . It is ABSOLUTELY MAGICAL ! The card is physically smaller than the old Broadcom . Install took \* maybe \* 3 minutes , if that long and it was my first time ever replacing mini-pci . Works right out of the box with Ubuntu 7.10 -LRB- Gutsy -RRB- without editing \/ etc\/modules or \/ etc\/modprobe . d \/ \* . Driver loaded `` automagically '' and works flawlessly with GNOME NetworkManager . Where the other card gave me 65-70 % connectivity , this card gives a consistent 85 % with greater throughput . Good riddance Broadcom ! Bye-bye ndiswrapper ! So long bcm43xx-fwcutter ! If you dont know what those last few terms mean -LRB- and trust me you really dont want to know them ! -RRB- but you want to run Linux happily on a Latitude D600 or similar mini-pci based laptop , GET THIS CARD !!!

This is by far the best wifi adapter for use with TiVo , their support for other devices is spotty at best , but this unit works flawlessley , and it 's just the best choice from my experience . Supports WPA security , 54Mbps -LRB- 802.11 g -RRB- . 	Network Adapter
There is one installation issue with this adapter that I was not aware of , and it took me a few detours to get the wireless adapter functioning with my new TIVO series 2 box . The adapter plugs into the TIVO recorder and uses the TIVO software onboard the recorder to connect to the internet . Unfortunately , the software in the TIVO was a revision 7-something and that only works with WEP security encryption . Unfortunately in this case , my network uses WPS2-PSK wireless encryption . In order to access a network -LRB- like mine -RRB- using WPA-level encryption security , it was necessary to first download a software update from TIVO , to a level 8-something . But since I had no landline telephone access and the adapter could not get through to my network , I was apparently stuck . No way to download the software that was required to get the adqpter operating . Then I realized that I had an undocumented work-around . Since the adapter recognized all of my neighbors ' networks and showed their names -LRB- SSID -RRB- as networks TIVO identified in the setup program , I found one of those which had no security . I then set up my TIVO using my neighbor 's wireless network SSID as if it were mine . I was then able to connect to TIVO through my neighbor 's internet connection and download the software update which then allowed the adapter to access WPA security . After the download , I went back into TIVO settings and changed the wireless network setting from my neighbor 's to my own wireless network and the adapter and TIVO accepted my change without a hiccup . It worked , but before I figured that out , I spent a lot of time messing with setting up IP access settings -LRB- and inadvertantly shut my own computers out of my network until I hard-wired a laptop with a network cable and then added all of my devices ' IP addresses -RRB- . Do n't do that . Grab an unencrypted neighboring wireless signal and save yourself lots of time and aggravation . A note on how to find which neighbors ' accounts are unencrypted . My Netgear wireless setup program -LRB- which boots up with the computer every time it starts -RRB- has a search for available networks tab . I clicked that and it gave me a list of all networks my computer could identify , showing network name -LRB- called the SSID -RRB- , security level -LRB- WEP\/WPA\/WPA2-PSK or `` none '' -RRB- , and strength of signal . I noted the name of the strongest signal without security and then told TIVO that was `` my '' network . Good luck . 	Network Adapter
The adaptor works well and was easy to install . I did n't have to completely restart my Tivo , and this adaptor was much less expensive than the one advertised for the HD Tivo Premiere . 	Network Adapter
As I 've worked in PC repair , freelance consulting , and network administration , I 've learned having the capability to do things like update anti-virus software for a client -LRB- usually if an anti-virus program is going to fail , it 's on install , or the first update -RRB- , it 's nice to be able to hook into a high speed connection , even if the person 's computer does n't have a network card , or even a modem . <p> I 've also used it to troubleshoot existing connections -LRB- this NIC does have LEDs , so it makes troubleshooting pretty easy , although you can still run into 10\/100 problems ... do n't be surprised if your hub is glowing amber instead of green ... it means your connection is only running at 10 MBPS versus 100 -RRB- , and bypassing bad network cards . <p> As it is portable , it is my own personal toolkit which only really consists of stuff I use often enough to justify limited space . <p> At USB 1 , the maximum speed for this product is 12 MBPS ... which means if you 're going to use it for an internet connection , it probably will do just fine -LRB- most internet connections , you 're a VERY lucky person to have even a 1 MBPS connection -RRB- , but for networking , it will run almost 90 % slower than a standard network card -RRB- . <p> I got a brochure recently for the much awaited 2.0 -LRB- which runs at 480 MBPS , although I 'm not sure if the 2.0 network card will run that fast . At the very least , I imagine it will be true 10\/100 -RRB- , but I 'm still not sure when that will be released . <p> As for this product 's durability , it is slightly fragile ... but I 've had mine for over six months now , and I have n't had a day 's problem with it ... treat it gently , and it 'll last a good long time . <p> If your in repair , I 'd suggest one of these , and a USB drive of at least 128 Megs -LRB- I kept tapping out my 64 , although 64 is still great for pulling drivers from your working machine to one that probably does n't connect to the internet ... or pulling a sample of a corrupted file back to the shop for analysis .

The manufacturer claims there is a Windows 7 driver , but it does n't work . Not on my desktop w \/ all the system updates . From either the CD or the website . I 'm fairly adept with technology , and I spent -LRB- too many -RRB- hours trying to get this to work . I 'm not about to change registry values or other critical settings hoping that driver will load . Key is that the support offered by the manufacturer is dismal . Sent it back . Do not buy .

I like having the Tivo wireless , but the main draw back is that it uses WEP encryption . I had to lose wireless capability with my laptop ... it uses WPA encryption . 	Network Adapter
I have three of these , one for each TiVo box and could n't be happier . They are very simple to install and activate . I use one with a new TiVo Premiere and have had no problems with that model although I do n't download movies from Netflix or any other site so I really ca n't comment on how well the Wireless G adapter works compared with their newer Wireless N network adapter which I have been told by friends is a little more difficult to install . I would definitely buy another one of these if I bought a new TiVo box regardless of the model . 	Network Adapter
If you ca n't connect your TiVo using an Ethernet cord then this is the next best thing . This is the only wireless adapter that you should using if you own a TiVo . This adapter was specifically design for TiVo . 	Network Adapter
While the thought of being able to simply plug-and-play and get 802.11 wireless networking is appealing , the d-link does n't deliver . The installation was fairly simple , requiring only a quick reboot -LRB- after setting IP addresses , etc -RRB- . But ! I have never been able to get more than 2Mbps out of this device , even 2 feet from the AP . I have a laptop with built-in wireless , and it easily gets 6mbps . Also , my Win98 computer is less than reliable while using the D-Link ... Windows blue-screens after a short while -- generally when transferring moderate to large amounts of data . <p> In all , you 'd do best to check out the USB solutions from other manufacturers -LRB- I know for a fact Lucent ORINOCO and Linksys have similar products -RRB- .

This device was my last resort . I purchased a Panasonic VIERA TC-P50X3 50-Inch for me and my wife 's bedroom , I tried netgear 's wireless usb device -LRB- NETGEAR RangeMax WNDA3100 Dual Band Wireless-N Adapter -RRB- but it would drop the signal while streaming Netflix multiple times . So I decided to try Panasonic 's wireless USB device -LRB- DY-WL10 Wireless LAN Adapter -RRB- , again the signal would drop . This is very aggravating . I was thinking maybe is my router , Its a Belkin `` N '' with up to 300Mbps . So decided to try one last device this Belkin AV500 , SO FAR SO GOOD ! yes its a bit pricey , but you have a stable and reliable connection for streaming movies and music . There are cheaper versions -LRB- VideoLink Powerline and the VideoLink 3 Powerline Internet Adapter , but I did n't want to wait on the shipping just to be disappointed , so I purchased this device at my local BB and I could n't happier . I would sugeest this to anyone looking for a stable connection . 	Network Adapter
We 've had ours for about two weeks and is working perfectly . Installation was as easy as 1-2-3 . Also , buying on Amazon saves you $ 20 . Tivo 's site is selling the same item for $ 59.99 . 	Network Adapter
I also have a d_link DWL-1000AP so the setup of this item was very straightforward . Hooked it up to the client PC and set a few IP configurations and I was wired to my network and internet . Speed is as good as the wired PC 's for internet access . The only fault I can find is that with WEP enabled I can not get to the internet . My network connection seems to be fine though . Customer service impossible to get too , they tell you to leave a message and they will call back . I am running windows 2000 server and professional on the PC 's in my network and the help files do not work in those versions of windows . I am trying to get the help files for my OS but no luck so far . The three star rating is more for service and support than for the product itself . 	Network Adapter
I bought this item in Decemeber 09 , and just the other day -LRB- 7\/24\/10 -RRB- , I finally was able to get it hooked up and working exactly as it is supposed to work . The problem was n't the unit as it arrived very promptly after ordering in new condition as advertised , -LRB- original packaging -RRB- , and it seemed easy enough to hook up . Plug it into Tivo , follow the Tivo Central instructions , and all should be hooked up . I tried for hours to get it to work with phone calls to Tivo support and DLink support , and just gave up in utter frustration . As I said , problem was not with Tivo wireless hookup , problem was with third party network management software -LRB- Network Magic -RRB- . I had tried , when I first got the item to hook it up with help from Tivo support , but everytime I got to entering the security key\/password , -LRB- one step away from completion -RRB- , it always said unable to find network even though it always found the network , by name , earlier in the process . During my second attempt -LRB- 7\/24\/10 -RRB- to finally get this hooked up , the Tivo support rep. mentioned I needed to call my DLink support and get the key\/password to enter . I had gone through this before , and knew the DLink call would cost about $ 40 since the support period had run out long ago . It struck me then that I had Network Magic network management software , and asked if that could be the issue . Tivo does n't support that software and the rep. told me to call Network Magic and ask them if there was something blocking my connection . After getting off the phone , I checked Network Magic software and found a `` Network Lock '' selection that I disabled and was immediately able to connect to the wireless Tivo . The `` Network Lock '' prohibited any other device from entering my network , but it also kept the Tivo from making the final connection . I did call the Netork Magic support a few days later to confirm that disabling , then reenabling would not cause any furter disruption to the Tivo connection . I was told once in the network , stays in the network . Hope this helps someone out there cause I spent several hours trying to get this item to work . 	Network Adapter

I have a home network and a Sony SVR-3000 series 2 TiVo so I purchased a WUSB11 in order to put the TiVo on the home network and disconnect it from the phone line . <p> TiVo recommends the WUSB11 v2 .6 specifically . Amazon 's description did not actually say if this was the version shipping but I did receive the correct version with my order . <p> The unit is very compact and I was able to set it back inside a solid oak AV cabinet with glass doors without any serious loss of signal quality . The WUSB11 draws all its power from the USB connection so I did not have to run a power cable into the cabinet for it . <p> Thanks for putting the WUSB11 in my Gold Box offers , Amazon .

History has shown that we Mac owners tend to get left out in the rain when it comes to product compatibility . Naturally , I was initially skeptical when I placed my order for this little dongle . Faced with a MacBook Pro Unibody hosting a fried WiFi card and a $ 100 repair bill -LRB- not including labor -RRB- , I was looking for every , and any , solution available . Call me surprised . The dongle itself is cast in a slightly cheap-ish white plastic housing with a built-in green LED status light . It looks robust enough to take some good whacks , but probably not a direct drop -LRB- though I doubt any USB would -RRB- . It extends about 7mm out from the side and is very secure . No wiggle and a firm fit in the port . The included mini install CD wo n't work in a slot-loaded drive , but their website was very user friendly and had downloads for Windows , Mac , and Linux . Once downloaded , the setup was very simple and had drivers for both PPC and Intel machines . The only caveat is that the Apple AirPort Utility is bypassed while their own Wireless Network Utility is used instead . Connection to my home 's AirPort network was very fast and , dare I say it , quicker than the built-in WiFi , while actual throughput was identical . Range was also on-par with my prior 802.11 N setup . On the whole , I 'd highly recommend this adapter to anyone looking at a steep laptop repair bill ! 	Network Adapter
It works well . The only problems I had is that occasionally it loses it 's connection . Out of no where , too . Suddenly a message will appear from the taskbar that says it is trying to regain the connection . It does n't take long to do , but it does it often . It is versatile too . I have it installed on two different computers , since they are n't networked , i can simply unplug the adapter from one , move it to the other and within a minute or so I have a connection . But it , too , loses the connection . Overall , if you need an adapter , fast , or if your just tight on money , this adapter will do . 	Network Adapter
I have my Apple AirPort base station configured to have a separate SSID under a 5GHz network , so that I can keep my older devices that ca n't do 802.11 n or 5GHz from slowing down the whole network . So , it was important to me that this adapter supports a 5GHz network for maximum speed . I have two of these , one on each of my Premiere boxes . The multi-room streaming feature has been silky smooth ; the network adapters have no problem keeping up with the data rate necessary to have a great experience streaming or transferring shows between boxes . Setting these up was quick and easy . It took longer for me to unpack them from the box than it took to do the network setup . There are some cheaper bridges out there , but the ones I found could n't do 5GHz . So if that 's important to you like it is for me , to ensure you 're getting the fastest speeds , then this is a great option for the price . 	Network Adapter

With more and more home computer users going to 802.11 n only networks , the addition of this new Wireless N Adapter from Tivo is well-timed . It works well , does the job , and , with the exception of a somewhat awkward procedure for connection to non-Point & Play routers -LRB- like my Apple Airport Extreme -RRB- , is easy to use .

For the low price of $ 29.99 , thanks to this product I am now picking up signals as far as a mile away with the 9 '' antenna attached . This unit has great software that allows you to choose connections and shows you with a graph the transmitting and receiving signals while in use . Software is very user friendly , instant installation without having to jump through a bunch of `` hoops '' . There are many features to choose from , including being able to edit connections . There is even an `` information '' button that gives you all the information about any given connection , even whether it is a b , g , or n connection . -LRB- no passwords of course , but everything else -RRB- . The unit comes in a box with a 5 '' antenna which you can screw into it , but also included is a 9 '' antenna which really reaches out there . You can use this antenna with or without the internet adapter that came installed in your computer -LRB- some antennas conflict with the pre-installed wireless so you have to turn off one to use the other-but not this one ! -RRB- I have even used both my pre-installed adapter along with this antenna to boost signal ! I really appreciate and use the reviews on Amazon.com to decide on a purchase when I 'm not sure which one is the best for my price range , and about the only complaint was that trying to use the 9 '' antenna was cumbersome because it kept falling out of the clip on the suction cup or simply tipped over when plugged directly into the computer USB port . Well , I do n't claim to be a rocket scientist , but get rid of the clip and slip the antenna through the hole on the suction cup attachment , or simply `` prop it up '' when plugged directly into your USB port . No problem-no hassle . IMHO , the best antenna sold on Amazon without paying a couple of hundred bucks . 	Network Adapter
I needed this EtherFast USB2 .0 10\/100 Network Adapter for my Tivo . This is a very small item which is easy to install and works great ! But , be careful when handling it . When I was installing another devise , I had to move some cables and the cover came off ! Without the cover it does not work . I found the cover and snapped it back in place . All it well ! 	Network Adapter
I recieve the product as said on the web and shipment was quick . Thanks 	Network Adapter
I spend 6 hours speaking with the folks at Linksys , trying to get the adapter to work on a new Dell system running XP . Nothing worked . 	Network Adapter
I 'm using mine in an all mac house so we have the latest Airport two transmitter Air Port Extreme . I followed all the steps in the initial Tivo setup and connected the adapter to the Tivo . It quickly recognized my network . Once I entered my password I was in business . I live in a two story log home . My wireless base station is in the basement at the other end of the house and I get a 75 % signal ; so even though I have a lot in between the Tivo and the base station . And my experience has been very good . I would n't hesitate to recommend this adapter to anyone with a Tivo ; I 've used the phone connection method and I would not go back to that . If your network is properly setup you should n't have any trouble at all . 	Network Adapter
Great price and wonderful product . Exactly as stated and works great . It was received within a week of ordering !! I could n't be happier . 	Network Adapter
Unit installed seamlessly on my Linksys network . Works fine and as advertised . 	Network Adapter
Replaced my old Linksys 802.11 b and Compaq iPaq 802.11 b network adapters with two of these . Works great in both B and G environments . 	Network Adapter
I just installed Linksys USB adapter after my D-Link DWL-120 died after 1 yr of use . It took me less than 5 minutes to set it up . It works great ! After my experience with D-Link products and technical supports , I 'll stick with Linksys products . I have n't tried Linksys technical support yet . But , my other Linksys items have worked so well and have been so simple to install , I have n't needed to contact them . 	Network Adapter
I bought it for the price -LRB- it was on sale -RRB- . I have DSL so the . b speed is plenty . Worked initially when there was not much security . But , the moment you enabled WAP etc , it worked when the PC was on , but lost its settings after a reboot . You have to enter wep keys every time !!! Tech support -- after loooooog waits , flounders around , abliet very politely . After 2-3 calls , they escsalated the levels to `` level 3 '' who was supposed to call back with a solution , but does not . Basically , they will drag \/ delay etc till you give up & tey do not have to honor the lifetime warranty they advertise . Also , I had XP related problems -LRB- as did a few others -RRB- . I have been working on PCs for 20 yrs , and this is a bust . Avoid if you want security . If you live in the farm and do not care about neighbors , I think it will work provided you do not load the adapter with encryption etc. . 	Network Adapter
This printer was very nice for the first month we owned it - nice pictures with the photo printing cartridge . Then , we had the first cartridge `` failure '' and it has been downhill since . Nearly brand new cartridges fail , producing horrible prints and wasting large amounts of money . All of our attempts to get help from HP did not solve the problem and now we do n't even bother trying to fix the failed print cartridges . They still work , just make awful looking print outs with lines through them . I do n't feel like throwing away another 30 bucks just to have the nearly full cartridge fail in a couple of weeks ! Remember when HP was a sign of a quality printer ? I 'm starting to forget too ! 	Printer
I purchased these ink cartridges for an Epson Stylus Photo 1280 , as they were listed as compatible . It turns out that only the T007 model was compatible , not the T008 . I was offered the opportunity to pay the difference to get a T009 cartridge . Make sure you double-check which cartridges actually work with your printer , and do n't rely on the product 's own advertising . 	Printer
The print quality of the 3740 is good , but my main complaint with it is that HP does n't make it clear that you need a USB A\/USB B cable to connect it to your computer ... which is sold separately -LRB- you can get the Belkin Pro Series USB 2.0 Device Cable -LRB- USB A\/USB B , 10 Feet -RRB- from Amazon for $ 6.74 , or else for ~ $ 13 at Wal-Mart -RRB- . Why would they sell you a printer without the necessary connectivity hardware to use it ? Also , it does n't come with the HP 28 cartridge -LRB- black -RRB- , and that costs about $ 22 extra as well . Bottom line , this $ 40 printer will cost more like $ 65 - $ 80 depending on where you get your cable . The Canon PIXMA iP1500 is a good alternative and the printer cartridges are much less expensive . More about print quality . I ca n't say that I was disappointed by the quality of the printed photos . The pictures are professional quality as long as you are using good photo paper -LRB- which is the case with any printer -RRB- . Text is good as well , plus the printer is very small which makes it handy if you do n't have a lot of desk space left after hooking up your scanner , wireless router , phone adaptor , cable modem and other various junk that can wind up on a computer desk .

For about $ 250 you get a machine that will do a variety of tasks , but will not do any of them really well . As mentioned the software can be problematic . I also had a problem setting the fax function to work on a voice line . A problem I discovered about new HP -LRB- and Epson -RRB- products is that these machines use smart chips in their ink cartridges , and that these cartridges are now time limmited . They have an expiration date ! This limits cartridge refilling and forces consumers to toss good cartridges and go buy new ones periodically . For these reasons I suggest you look at Canon or Brother . 	Printer
Because this product was refurbished I was worried but it has worked perfectly and what a savings . I will redorder from the same place . 	Printer
This may be a fine machine , but it is huge ! We were buying it to replace our old black and white laser printer , but it is at least twice the size -LRB- check your dimensions carefully -RRB- . Since it is not sold through Amazon but rather through a 3rd party seller -LRB- PCRush -RRB- , I would have to pay shipping , over $ 50 ! For now we will hang on to it in hopes that we can find somewhere to squeeze it eventually . 	Printer
I 've owned a similar printer by Canon and it lasted 10 yrs -LRB- BJ-10 -RRB- . The next one lasted about 2 years , but I travel extensively and exposed it to a dusty harsh industrial environment . I currently have owned the iP-90 for a year and it performs well without any problems other that when I forget to fluff the paper in the feeder and two sheets are fed thru . Several of my clients have seen me use this printer and have purchased one too . It is more expensive than other printers , but the size and quality beat the rest hands down . It easily fits into my computer bag so I always have a good printer on the road . 	Printer
When it works the pictures , transfers and post cards we 've produced look great ! <p> The problem is : you just do n't know when it 's NOT going to look great . You \* must \* baby-sit the printer , and about half way through each print -LRB- when you can actually see a portion of the image -RRB- decide if the printer is function correctly . <p> To get two transfers -LRB- at a each , just for the paper -RRB- we 've had to print four times ... wasting paper . 1st try : good . 2nd : oops - clean the heads -LRB- uses ink -RRB- . 3rd : oops , clean the head . 4th : great ! Tah-dah ! <p> Post cards : same thing . Several great Xmas cards in a row , then wham ! Bad one . Clean the heads . Several good , and another bad . <p> If you like babysitting , do n't mind wasting money every now and then , enjoy listening to the printer cleaning the heads and printing test sheets , this printer is for you ! <p> Love the instructions that come with Epson 's transfer paper , too . `` Place the printable side up , '' it says . Uh , could you be a little less specific ? There 's two sides , and this is my first time using the paper . Is that the smooth side , or the rough side ? <p> `` Choose ` Flip Image ' in the driver . '' Uh , AI N'T no flippin ' `` Flip Image '' option anywhere I can find ! <p> On the plus-side : the printer has a small footprint so it does n't take a lot of room on your desk . Ink cartridges are easy to replace . <p> On the negative side : any paper thicker than your normal printer paper requires you be present to hand-feed each sheet . Post cards , business cards , etc will feed multiple sheets and jam the printer . Another `` Engineering '' marvel . <p> Yeah , but when it works ... nice pictures are assured ! When I win the lottery , I 'll try a different brand , and let you know how they compare . 	Printer
I bought this printer one month ago , I upgraded from an Epson Photo Stylus , that has nothing but head clogging from day one . this printer I wanted to wait a month and see how it behaved after sitting for a week without use , etc and ink consumption . I am using this on Apple G4 933 , using USB 1.0 , OS 10.3.5 . the Canon printer software installed without a hitch , and the interface and options are much more easier to use then the epson drivers were in OS X. I was never able to print on 4x6 borderless prints in my epson , always wanted to print somewhere not where the media was , the Canon is flawless , I have printed to 5x7 , and 4x6 photo paper using iPhoto and no problems . beautiful prints ! better then what Epson gave me , smaller droplet technology and higher resolution then what my Epson of similar cost provided 2 years ago . I picked this Pixma 400 up for $ 118 on sale at Office Depot . you can store your paper in the lower tray , and keep photo paper or CD labels in the top tray , and choose either from the front button on the unit where your printing too , or you can do it via software , this is my only complaint , is in the initial print dialogue box when yo print from OS X this is not an option to choose your source tray , you have to go into media option and then choose from there , by default it will use what the button on the unit is lite for . No biggie . Also duplex is done the same way , an extra 2 stesp to set an option , I think you shoudl have easier access too . once you get used to knowing to set this before printing , everything else is to love about this . printer , never had to clean heads , ink consumption seems to be very low , I have made several prints , speed is very good in all my friends opinions compared to there printers and eye popping quality on canon paper plus or pro paper . I 'm very happy with this product , was considering the i860 or i960 but this won my appeal for the duplex option , whcih helps you save paper when printing websites , Ive even ran HP brochure paper through with asstounding results .

This HP printer was an upgrade for me . I had a very inexpensive HP that I beat to death . It was very reliable and printed beautiful photos . I paid the extra for this printer 's WiFi capability and because I was told that the photos would be beautiful . From the get-go I 've had a problem with the wireless connection . I 've just found it easier now to use the cord . But , my real issue is with PRINTING ANYTHING . It can take between 30 seconds and 1-1\/2 minutes before it prints -LRB- making very loud noises during this whole process -RRB- . And , sometimes , after all of the noise that makes you believe you will get a printed sheet of paper , it sends a message to load paper in the tray -- this despite having a full tray of paper . Printing photos is next to impossible . My blood pressure is so high by the time I actually get a photo to print that I truly ca n't appreciate that the photo quality is excellent -LRB- which it is -RRB- . However , this process can take as long as 5 minutes because the photo paper tray simply can not distinguish that there is paper in the tray . Do your self a favor and perhaps prevent a heart attack and DO NOT buy this machine . Oh , one other comment ... the ink is unbelievably expensive . Despite buying the XL cartridges , the ink simply does n't last long enough to be worth the price . 	Printer
In this day and age of the marketing machine , many products abound in the market place that promises much more than they deliver . I am aware of this marketing machine that hypes up products , and have been extremely cautious as a consumer . That being said , I am extremely happy with this printer . Yes , it sucks up ink like a hog . And yes , if you want a good print you need to use the correct Epson paper . I tried using other photo paper and prints came out hideously . But when I used the recommended Epson papers , the results are phenomenal and well worth the price . Epson makes it 's paper specifically for it 's printers . What 's the point of taking beautiful pictures just to have it stored on the computer or printed out low quality at one of those kiosks . With this printer , I 've been pulling gallery quality prints using Epson Premium Luster Photo Paper . The color range is phenomenal , and the prints ALWAYS look better than the images on the screen -LRB- I have an Apple 19 ' Studio display monitor -RRB- . It 's like magic every time I hit the print button . I highly recommend this printer to people who would pay a little more for quality ! 	Printer
i bought this machine after having major problems with hp 4500 wireless all in one machine . This brother set up was a snap as a fax and wireless shared printer . Highly recommend this machine after a frustrating experience with the hp . Hope this helps somebody else . I have now had this machine for several months excellent performance still highly recomend . 	Printer
I just bought this all-in-one and for me the ease of setup was excellent . It probably took me 10 minutes after unwrapping to set up . My only complaint thus far is that I really had difficulty figuring out how to scan multiple pages into one document . I actually had to call their support center in order to figure this out . Other than that it prints great , fax setup was a breeze . 	Printer
I bought this from Office Depot . It was a lemon from the moment I took it out of the box . I had to contact tech support several times over a 2 month period for several issues including : 1 -RRB- control panel would freeze 2 -RRB- it would n't detect ink cartridges 3 -RRB- cardstock jams 4 -RRB- fax would not respond to incoming I use this mainly for a small business so it 's a very important machine to me . I would get frustrated because every time I called tech support I would get the standard `` disconnect the power then reconnect '' or `` update your firmware '' . They would remotely access my computer to try and fix things but never could and I 'd be without use of my computer and printer for up to an hour at a time . FINALLY a tech said it seems to be defective and we 'll replace it . Duh ?! I was told I would get a replacement in 7 to 10 business days and I said that was unacceptable since I need it everyday and I 've already been without full use of it since I bought it . So the tech said she 'd make sure I got it in 2 business days . When I called on the 2nd business day to get a tracking # , I learned the tech had not sent out the replacement yet and it would be another 2 business days . AAAAAAAAAAA . I angrily told the tech to overnight that replacement or else and he did . So here I sit at my desk with work piling up waiting for the printer to arrive . Apparently I 'm the last delivery of the day . FIGURES !! This one better work !! 	Printer
If your in the market for a Laser printer and on a budget , THIS IS IT !!! This is my FIRST laser printer and I 'M not going back to inkjets ever , ever again !! I went wireless and the setup was soooooo easy ! Just pop the CD and follow . That 's it . I highly recommend this Laser printer !!!! Thanks BROTHER for making a GREAT , affordable product !!!

As the title suggests , the limited use that we have made of the all-in-one has been good . We have only explored the print and scan functions which have been good , the scan software allowing the collecting of several different files to create one PDF file has been quite useful . Print speed is acceptable , wi-fi functions well . For the price , it is a great value . 	Printer
I loved the printer . I pulled it out of the box , setup it up on a shelf and started printing photos directly from my memory stick -LRB- no computer needed -RRB- . I love that feature . But , the photographs were stunning . I 've been taking photographs professionally and for family over 40 years - these color photos are hard to tell from the original lab prints I have -LRB- for comparison purposes , the digital images I printed were created at the same time the photo lab printed the 4x6 's I compared to -RRB- . The color accuracy is amazing . The blacks are rich and dark , the contrast is impressive , and the Yellows , Gold , and Orange tones were perfect -LRB- very hard for most printers , even the professional lab systems to get right -RRB- . Then I installed all the software and hooked it up to my Mac . It intalled alot of software and integrated perfectly . The ink cartridges installed quite easily and are fool-proof . There are 6 of them and they are keyed so that you ca n't install the wrong color . The touch screen is larger than preview screens on earlier or similar printers . That makes a HUGE difference to older people who ca n't see or figure out the odd arrays of buttons . I had my 77 year old Mother print several photos without much coaching . She has never used a computer or a digital camera . She found the simple touch screen directions to be sufficient . Cons : I hate the tiny paper tray . I have never understood the logic of designing a printer that only holds 20 sheets of paper -LRB- unless it was designed to be portable -RRB- . The ink is very sensitive to touch - be careful . It 's hard to tease out the 4x6 prints from the tray . The paper tray design is nuts - cheap and awkward to use . It took me 20 minutes to figure out where the special 4x6 Photo tray was located -LRB- Under the output tray -RRB- . Dumb design , HP ! OK , I have another gripe . The software drivers have way too many options , but worse , the installation did not make this printer the primary or default printer , as I think it should have . And , more importantly , the Photo -LRB- 4x6 -RRB- tray where I have the photo paper , is not the default tray or the choice for `` automatic '' ? Why not - the primary attraction on this kind of printer is 4x6 photos , not 8x10 !? Last insult - HP gives you 2 free 4x6 sheets to print on !! TWO Wow , how cheap can you get . The printed has an external power supply . -LRB- Sorry , I hate external power supplies of all sizes and shapes , but especially on computer equipment . My floor is cluttered up enough with a tangle of dusty and poorly marked cables -RRB- On the other hand , HP now ships printers -LRB- again -RRB- with a USB cable . HP went through some bad times when they did n't even ship with Mac drivers or USB cables . Thank goodness they are past that ugly stage in their history . GOOD NEWS : You can and should buy extra printer cartridges . Not individually , at first , but get two of the VIVERA packs for about $ 35 each . They have 150 sheets of 4x6 photo paper and all 6 ink cartridges . I was going to buy the 8250 -LRB- introduced this time last year -RRB- . It was out of stock and the prices are coming down on both of them . This printer has a much better touch pad screen - well worth the extra bucks and extra space . 	Printer
I have had this printer for about 2 months now . It 's by far the best printer I have had . The scans are excellent and it has an auto feeder for documents that I really need , it scans pictures great . I scanned some pictures and printed them and they came out better than the originals . Copier works great and fast . Fax machine is easy to use . I also like the fact that it has two paper feeds . The only drawback is that it is rather large . Other than that it does everything I need and it does it very good . I like it so much I went and bought another Canon all in one for my daughter , I got her the MP500 and it is also an excellent machine but it has no fax . 	Printer
This gets six stars for CD\/DVD printing . I purchased it for that alone . You can easilly print 100-200 CD 's on one set of ink . By then the rollers may wear and the printer will have a problem ejecting the disc . No problem just pull it out a little while it is ejecting . When you are almost out of ink , call Epson warranty service and they will send you another printer with new ink cartridges ! They even cover the shipping . For $ 99.00 or so , you can have a printer for a year with free ink ! 	Printer
I purchased this photo printer based on Consumer Report 's ranking this unit tops in the category . It is a terrific printer . The unit prints pictures with better quality than a local photography place with top of the line equipment . My unit I bought from one vendor included the battery , which was a very big bonus . Do yourself one big favor , and this is not a sales pitch . Buy a premium\/high quality gloss\/semi-gloss photo paper for this printer . Stay away from index card like matte paper and any after-market or generic brand paper . You will only be wasting your money and print quality . This unit does not need to work with a computer -LRB- although it can -RRB- so click and print and have fun with this !! 	Printer
How disappointing ! I do n't require much from a printer -LRB- My main use is making cards for my Grandchildren and printing photos -RRB- , so I THOUGHT this would be a GREAT bargain ! WRONG !! After I FINALY got it to work -LRB- somewhat !? -RRB- , it ate the paper , and if it did n't do THAT , then the paper got JAMMED and had to be pulled out ! It also stops printing in the middle of something ; The green power button continues flashing ; and you 're left high and dry as to WHAT to do next ! In the span of a Sunday afternoon -LRB- which turned out to be ANYTHING but PLEASANT !! -RRB- , I was able to print out TWO cards ! I 've owned 2 other printers , and this one is by far the worst ! I 'm just waiting for the store to open to RETURN IT ! 	Printer
I purchased the Polaroid PoGo today and have done a fair bit of `` playing '' with this compact little printer over the past couple of hours . In fact , I have already used the first package of 10 sheets of Zink -LRB- Zero Ink -RRB- paper that come with the printer . So my first recommendation is ; if you are planning on buying a PoGo , I highly recommend getting extra paper so you can get through your `` testing '' phase without having to purchase more paper . However , do n't go crazy and buy too much , there are expiration dates on the paper which may affect your picture quality if you take to long to `` expose '' -LRB- print -RRB- them . Connectivity : I have tested the Bluetooth capabilities with my Motorola Q , Laptop Computer -LRB- Bluetooth enabled -RRB- , my desk-top Windows Vista computer -LRB- with Radio Shack `` Bluespoon '' Bluetooth 2.0 adaptor added -RRB- and my PictBridge capable Canon Powershot A 640 camera -LRB- directly connected to PoGo via USB cable -RRB- and the printer worked like a charm in all of the above tests ! Speed of Printing : Print time is about 1 minute per photo . There was no noticeable change in print speed with any of the tests I performed . Using the Bluetooth -LRB- wireless -RRB- connection or plugging in your USB cable directly from your camera did not seem to make any difference as to how fast the image printed . Image Quality : Not great ... but not the worst I have seen either ... The pictures I printed from my camera -LRB- via USB connection -RRB- looked better than my pictures from my cell phone , but this was likely due to the higher megapixel image created by my camera versus the 1 megapixel image from my cell phone . However , the `` white balance '' of both my camera and cell phone images were a little `` off '' . The whites were extremely white -LRB- almost washed-out -RRB- and the dark -LRB- shadow areas -RRB- were very dark . So if you stay away from printing bright `` beach \/ snow '' images or dark `` night '' photographs you will be OK . Photos with lots of color -LRB- flowers , for example -RRB- looked pretty good when printed with the PoGo . Cool things to do : The adhesive on the back of the photo paper is a nice feature of this product . This makes it possible to add pictures to your hand written journals . You can stick them to business card magnets and put photos all over your refrigerator . You can make photo luggage tags , cards and much , much more . If you do n't need the highest quality image , but want to do some fun , creative stuff with photographs I would definitely recommend the PoGo . If you are a photographer hoping that the PoGo would give you a quick `` proof '' of what your printed images will look like , then this printer is probably not for you , since the image quality is not as good as you could get with some standard ink jet printers . Have fun ... 	Printer
This is my first time to buy EPSON printer . -LRB- I used to use HP -RRB- . Overall quality is acceptable , but I still got some strange and unknown problems . Since I am a software engineer , I did resolve by myself . But I could not image how end-user could handle it well . <p> 1 . Drivers are too complicated . 2 . EPSON 's USB has problem to talk to Windows XP sometimes . 3 . Ink monitor is not accurate . 4 . EPSON may show Fatal Error on it 's screen sometimes . 	Printer
I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of the prints , given the low price of this printer . I have no regrets over this purchase . Set up intstructions were clear and easy to follow . On screen menus are easy to follow . You can print directly from your memory card without even using a computer . All in all , I would highly recommend this product . 	Printer
In my time using it , -LRB- approximately 1 month . -RRB- it has worked excellently and I have no issues of any kind . I highly recommend it and love the fact at its price point that it has a built in fax , multi sheet scanner feeder , dual side printing and affordable cartridges . It is very quick in warming up and relatively quite operation . Print quality is good too , rivaling lasers . 	Printer
Got this printer for my birthday in July 2003 . Five years later and it 's still chuggin ' along as well as it ever did . Cheap and easy to find ink tanks , when it thinks it 's dirty it does a self-maintenance cleanup . Photo quality is great , I mean right to the edge of the photo paper if you ask that of it . I 've been through a lot of printers before this one , Fujitsu DL3600 -LRB- 89-98 -RRB- , HP-712C -LRB- 97-99 -RRB- , Canon BJC-1000 , BJC-2000 , BJC-2100 and in 2002 a Canon i320 -LRB- which gave up after only a few months -RRB- . Kinda glad it did because ... Frustration set in big time but I was soon rewarded with a `` good '' printer , the one I still have today -LRB- August 2008 -RRB- . The Canon i450 If you see one nowadays that 's cheap and in good working order somewhere , snap it up . You wo n't be disappointed . 	Printer
I am going to discuss what bothered me first about this printer and then go into what I like about it . Nothing will detract any stars just sort of little niggles that bugged me upon setting it up . Cons : - Starter Cartridges : I realize the full set of cartridges can cost above $ 150 and can last over 2500 sheets -LRB- black high yield -RRB- it just seems that for a printer in this price range they would give you full cartridges and not ones filled so little . - Setup had to be repeated 9 times : I followed all of the instructions for unpacking and removing of all of the tape and plastic bits sent with it for shipping . During setup it has you fill out date , time , and other things and goes into initialization . Each time it said please remove the packing materials and shut off . I checked every spot and could not find a single piece left . So I went and had to repeat the setup over and over . Finally I moved the print head all the way to the left and felt the area it rests in to see if there was a piece there . There was not but the next time I restarted it there was no problem . I am mentioning this not as a major complaint , just if you have the same issue it might help to see what fixed it . Pros : + Super fast : Prints as fast as my old Workforce 840 which was the fastest inkjet I had ever owned + Quiet : No issues with noisy printing at all + Super easy to set up on my wireless network + installation in Windows 7 and OSX Lion easy + Rear feeder is great for a double sided print Overall this is a great printer for a small office . With all of the attachments you can stack a full ream of paper inside . The complaints I have are small and just worth mentioning . Thank you for reading my review . 	Printer
I ordered 2 of these Aug. 31st . When I finally got these , the following year , I also received free Broderbund Print Shop software . It was worth the wait , The Print shop is an excellent program . Thanks Amazon . Cartridge works good and with the proper equipment is refillable . 	Printer
We have n't owned a Lexmark printer in the past , but we 'd read some good things about this one and liked the nice small footprint for printing , scanning , and faxing in our home office on our Windows 7 HP computer . On the positive side , it mostly works as advertised - for a while . On the negative , I believe that Lexmark took shortcuts on software , firmware , and obviously on support - perhaps in a rush to get this product to retail store shelves . We followed installation procedures carefully with the new printer , and though it worked initially , we had frequent problems with the wi-fi function . On some days , perhaps when the wind blew in just the right direction - the printer would not respond to it 's primary directive - it would n't print . We tried turning the printer on and off - no good . Only if we re-booted our computer would the printer again begin to respond . It would remain happy for some unspecified period of time before again refusing to print ; only a computer re-boot would do ! We 'll see if it keeps up - we have just downloaded updated firmware . Continuing in the negative category , my wife was pleased to be able to scan many old family photos directly to a USB connected flash drive . Cool feature ! But after scanning 3 pictures , it refuses to scan another one . Perhaps another Lexmark Pro705 strike ? `` Unfair to printer ! Unfair to scanner ! We wo n't print ! We wo n't scan ! '' Really hard to tell why it 's initiating work stoppages , only that it does with regularity . Finally my primary issue with Lexmark . When I started trying to sort out the problems with our computer , I found a page that noted there was updated firmware for the Pro705 . Great . Downloaded firmware update utility . It failed . Also part of the Lexmark work stoppage ? I tried this numerous times , all programs closed , doors open , on my head ; would n't work . I gave up for a few weeks and decided to attack again after another unscheduled outage . This time I found a Lexmark recommendation to use the installed printer 's update program to get the most current software . Great ! Simple to find the program under the `` Lexmark Programs '' on my Windows 7 machine . Ran the update program as suggested . `` You have updates . Downloading 4 Files . '' Yeehaaw ! Hang on ... `` Download failed '' Are you beginning to see the Lexmark trend now ? More on-line research on the support site for Lexmark . Finally found a page that referred to a known issue with the printer software and firmware that was shipped with my computer . I was assuming that this was all shipped with my computer AFTER it had been tested for functionality and stability . That would be an incorrect assumption . The Lexmark web page basically says , `` if you installed the printer with the software we shipped , you need to uninstall everything and start over . '' Do n't belive me ? Direct quote : `` If you used one of the original CDs from the above list you need to uninstall the driver , then download and install the latest version for Windows 7 from Lexmark website . '' -LRB- ... -RRB- So finally , I find out what to do ! Start over ! We 'll see how this update works out - but it does n't change the fact that you get dragged through the thorny underbrush by Lexmark before you even have a chance to get this product to work correctly . That 's bad enough , but since I registered with Lexmark , I would have loved for them to send me an e-mail letting me know how badly screwed up my software and firmware was for this product . Now the bottom line - I 'd recommend looking past Lexmark and explore other brands - any other brands ! 	Printer
Some of the gripes have to do with installation . I have found that there is a BUG in the installation process if you use the setup wizard -LRB- which you HAVE to use , by the way - to install print drivers on your PC -RRB- . To install , you do have to hook up temporarily to a wired network to communicate with the print server and tell it what your security scheme is . Someone complained about that , but with WIFI security , there really is no way around this . It detected my network with ease . Halfway through this detection process , you are prompted for the WEP or WPA keys if you use them , and then promted to remove the hardwire cable and ` reboot ' the print server . Supposedly when it comes back up , it is on your network ... . That 's where I ran into trouble . The WEP key was NOT transferred to the print server . I had to manually log into the server -LRB- http:\/\/192.168.1.xxx or whatever your subnet is -RRB- . To find the server 's ip address , log onto your network router and look at the DHCP clients table . There it is . If you assigned an IP address to it already , use the one you assigned . NOW , USING THE Print Server 's config pages , go manually type in the WEP key and it will be saved . For some reason the install wizard does n't transfer it - it got garbled in the process - at least on my setup . After that , all is well ! I 'm thrilled at printing `` bi-directional '' via USB for my Fax\/Scan\/Print multifunction printer . Now on to try scanning across the network . Not something I do frequently , but will be interesting to see if that works ... 	Printer
When I first received this printer it worked great . About 50 prints later , it 's a piece of junk . The automatic feed feature has stopped working . The pictures often have one or two white flecks where no color is printed . I keep the paper and printer clean , so I feel the problem is internal . In my opinion , this printer is not reliable and definitely not worth the price ! 	Printer
Note potential buyers : This model printer does not come with a printer cable to connect the USB of the computer port to the printer port . Must purchase separately . Ridiculous ! It does include the power cord just not the printer-computer cable . Off to purchase a separate printer cable i go - gotta love these 21st century manufacture mngt . decisions . 	Printer
My old Lexmark died and the salesman at OfficeMax talked me into this one and it looked great based on the features . I have had HP products in the past that were fine . NOT THIS ONE ! From the get-go it was a lemon . Got thru to the CD loading -LRB- I still have 3 GB space on my HD -RRB- and it spent 30 min trying to load the `` last step '' . I figured some glitch , removed the installed software twice , and same thing every time . Trying to print pdf files was beyond belief difficult . They tended to use an entire ream of paper with gibberish here and there on the page . Tried to save the pdf file , then print -- same thing . Converting it to Word would give me 3 good pages then shoot page after page of blank paper at high rates of speed . Or it would take 40 sec per page of black document type . After trying over and over , on 2 different computers , to get it to work , I decided to return the piece of junk -LRB- unlike others who exchanged it for same unit , I had had it and wanted my old dead Lexmark to be resurrected -RRB- . I found an all-in-one Lexmark 7100 , at half the price , took it home , and it worked like a dream right out of the box . My strong recommendation , if you are considering this or the 3310 , is to run like hell and find something , anything , else . I ca n't believe anyone is still selling this . 	Printer
I purchased this printer new a couple of years ago , and was generally very satisfied with it . UNTIL , it started developing printhead problems . Despite all the troubleshooting information that HP provides with its Toolbox , and after many hours of work , I was unable to restore the printer to normal operating function unless I purchased a very expensive printhead . So I did it , ONCE . And it worked fine for a few weeks but then failed again . So I called HP and after a long time on the phone with them , and weeks of waiting I received a new printhead under warranty . Replaced it again , and again after a few weeks , it started with the same problems . -LRB- Black ink was n't printing at all -RRB- . I was sick of it , and was about to throw it away , when diagnosing another inkjet printer , I came upon a suggestion to clean the printhead with HOT water . I had tried all kinds of chemicals -LRB- pen cleaner , alcohol , and cold water -RRB- but had never tried HOT water . It worked like a charm , and restored the functioning of the printer to like new . So , fix yours if you 're having a problem ! I do n't know why HP would n't recommend this , as it is so effective , and I think would improve their customer perception immensely . I 've always been a fan of HP , but with a few of their recent products , I have been less than impressed with reliability and support . So here it is . From the underground . Run the printhead under hot water at the sink for a couple of minutes , or for really stubborn clogs , put it in a pan and simmer for a couple of hours . I hope it works for you like it did for me !

If you are wanting to print color , it 's ok ... But if you are wanting to print black and white photos ... this is not for you every time I print a b & w photo it comes out purplish , called support and they say it is the software that I am using -LRB- adobe photoshop -RRB- and that I need to call them . Well I have printed different photos using different software and still purple . I may just end up returning it . I have tried adjusting everything I can think of and will not change anything . Very disappointed , I expected better quality . 	Printer
I received my Epson 960 a couple of weeks ago . I tested a number of other printers and was not satisfied . I did a lot of research and discoverd that the 960 was the first printer to have a 2 picoliter printhead . I am a portrait photographer and print my own brochures , this printer does an excellent job of showing small detail . My brochures have both text and pictures in them . This printer has 2 black ink cartridges for text . I also just read a GREAT review written in the magazine Shutterbug , Feb 2003 issue . To get a complete review from someone who knows what to look for I would recommend reading that article . 	Printer
I 've really enjoyed this printer the first year . But just after that I 've had the same problems that the other negative reviewers have mentioned . Apparently the ink dries and clogs up the heads and then you 're out of luck . I 've gone through the self clean steps several times and it has n't helped at all . I could probably take it to get repaired but it would cost $ 100 . That 's just about what I spent for this piece of junk . I 'd like to hear from the positive reviewers after they 've owned this for 12 months . Bottom line - I know these are priced to sell but DO NOT BUY . 	Printer
My husband and I run a lawn care business from our home office . One of the biggest tasks for the lawn care business is printing flyers . Flyers account for at least 75 % of our new business . In the past when I have attempted to print flyers with my old printer , it was a daylong task . When we print flyers we usually print off about 500 at a time . With this printer this task has become the least of our worries . This printer came straight out of the box and was hooked up and printing within five minutes . But more importantly , it has withstood the test of thousands of print jobs already . It 's a workhorse . Many have reviewed the specifics here already . I 've been using this printer since September 22nd and in the past two months I have fallen in love with it . Its wireless and that allows me to place the printer far away from my computer desk and not have to lose space in my work triangle area . I can send print jobs to the machine and not have to even listen to the printing if I want to because the printer does not have to even be in the same room ! One thing that was surprising to me is the fact that this printer can and does print some amazing photo 's on regular paper . This is fantastic for me because I like to print photo 's , quotes etc for my inspiration board in my office . This means that I can quickly print things and not go broke doing so using fancy paper just to get a decent print out . My inspiration board has never looked better . If you are a writer , artist , etc. this printer will make your heart happy . The printer is cost effective with a `` a high-yield of 2400 pages Black , 1200 pages color '' . The printer has built-in wireless networking . And you can print pictures from your cell phone wirelessly . No more docking up devices to get printed items or pictures . You simply download the app from -LRB- ... -RRB- . I love to be able to catch a great shot with my cell phone and print it out immediately once I get home . It 's great to have great photo 's and the print capability of using regular old print paper for a great photo . I have used photo paper and the print quality on those is absolutely amazing . But for our main purposes of our business , this printer can not be beat ! I 'm not the technical person . . my husband is . He set this up and had it running in less than ten minutes . Five of those minutes were spent on unpacking the product . It 's a bigger printer so be sure to check the measurements if you 're trying to fit it into a certain area or on a desk . 	Printer
OfficeMax was advertising this for $ 179 . Amazon was higher , but when I checked later they were at the same price . Bought from Amazon - Great deal . Very good quality printout . Reasonably fast . Good color - not inkjet quality but it is a laser and for the price what more can you ask for . 	Printer
The Canon printer works fine but , like many of Canon 's recent products -LRB- following the lead of other profit-mad vendors -RRB- , the cartridges contain small chips . You can remove the chip and place it on a generic replacement cartridge but it is a pain . I should have bought the comparable HP that I have in my office . Unless you want to spend a small fortune on lousy inkjet cartridges , I 'd avoid this product . 	Printer
I 've returned the HP375b printer for this one , and what an amazing printer . No more going to a photo lab or uploading to online photo labs , this 6 color ink printer produces stunning pictures everytime . I got a battery with this printer , and it is amazing how convenient it is to just take the printer and the camera whereever I want to be , then just sit and print . As they 've indicated , the pictures are smudge and waterproof , making it easier to handle right after printing them . The 6 color ink cartridge is a single unit , and it is a cinch to change them when needed . The printer has a USB port in the back that can be used to connect to a PC or other USB devices for backup or from which to read the pictures to print . I 've never had the chance to backup the pictures from memory cards to a CD-writer , as my memory cards are at least 1GB each and have found the CD writers to be past its time . However , the printer did not have any problem reading from other USB flash cards or from my 60Gig portable hard drive . A support to write to a DVD writer would be a plus with possibly from next firmware release of this printer . Only inconvenient thing the others may find is that the Pict Bridge connection is located on the back of the printer , rather than the front , where it is more convenient to handle the wires . I , however , found that it is more convenient to just take the memory card out of the camera and plug it into the printer cardreader . I do n't like wires , and all my devices , including my laptops , are portable , so this printer is a great addition to my overall system . This is a must have item if you love taking pictures , and a battery is a must have accessory . 	Printer
This printer worked fine for 2 years . 3 of the 4 ink cartridges need changing , so I did , and now nothing comes out at all . Epson only says I can take\/send it 60 miles away to be fixed at unknow cost or offer me a discount on a new one . No thanks ! This 5400 was a replacement for a 5200 that had the same problem . I 'm going back to HP . 	Printer
I purchased this printer in Feb 2011 . I have encountered many issues with this machine , the first being printhead errors . After calling Lexmark and walking through the steps to resolve , they replaced my printhead . I got the new printhead and the machine worked fine for about 6 weeks . It began to fail shortly thereafter . The WiFi connection was spotty and the printer just simply could n't communicate with my computer . After another conversation with Lexmark , they shipped me a new printer and I shipped the old one back . The new printer worked for about a 3 months and it too began to fail suddenly . Again , communication with my computer was poor and I was constantly having to restart both my computer and my printer in order to get it to work . Once again , Lexmark walked me through troubleshooting and sent me a new printer and I sent the old one back . The third new printer worked for a few months and then started getting printhead error messages . Once again , troublehshooting and a new printer . This time I demanded a new printer and not a refurbished one , as I was getting extremely frustrated with the hours I had devoted to this . I run a small business which does not require heavy printing at all ; this printer should have handled 10 pages daily with no issues . I estimated that I spent in all probably about 48 hours on the phone with lexmark , arguing and shipping old printers back and setting up new . This machine has given me nothing but problems . Finally , when the 4th printer failed after about 2 months , I called up the CEO of Lexmark 's office and demanded a refund . Today , about 3 months later , they have finally begun the process for getting me my refund . Again , I must ship back the defective machine . Every time I called customer support , I was connected in India and the people have difficulty understanding . But they all clearly conveyed one thought to me each time ; this unit has a lot of glitches and problems and that I was n't alone in my frustration . The $ 249 aside , this machine is n't worth the time and the grief it will cause you . When it was working , it worked well and suited my needs perfectly . But that was about 25 % of the time and I could n't afford to have my equipment be so unreliable . 	Printer
I purchased the printer from a seller on Amazon . The seller 's statements concerning the printer were extremely honest and helpful . The condition of the printer in no way reflects the seller but the manufacturer , HP . From reviewing forums on Hewett Packard 's site , the printer\/software had many flaws from the beginning . HP developed patches\/firmware updates for some problems but the carriage\/paper jams were simply addressed by instructing the consumers on how to manipulate the device to remove jams . This is a buggy printer , purchased as a back up for main device , also an HP All in One printer . Teens will have to learn to remove paper jams from the back door of device and slide the carriage from left to right to correct cartridge issues . I am not angry ; I got what I paid for . If I had purchased this printer brand new , I would have walked it back to Hewett Packard ! 	Printer
For many years I have used the HP Laserjet 4 and loved it ... and still do . But it does not have USB connectivity so I had to shop for another HP laserjet to hook up to my new iMac 24 desktop computer which does n't come with a parallel port , only USB ports . It 's a great printer and you can operate it in highest resolution 1200 dpi or save money and get nearly as good results at 600 dpi in economy mode , which I do and love . Resolution and performance is as good as the most expensive Laserjets and it handles the trays and single-sheet feeding perfectly . Shop for aftermarket cartridge replacements online when the time comes . Really , this is a fantastic printer and I 'm super picky and demanding ! I like my printed documents to be perfect , and with the 1320 you get perfection at an affordable price . HP puts out 1st class Laserjets that do n't breat down and have problems so I highly recommend the 1320 . I got mine through Amazon and could n't be more satisfied . 	Printer
This printer is a great value . ... my old Epson 600 , and the Z32 is twice the speed and twice the resolution and it does n't need to constantly clean the print head . This printer does an excellent job printing photos as well . The only problem I had was when I tried to print on special canvas paper -LRB- used for simulating oil paintings -RRB- . This paper was a little too thick I think because the printer could n't grab it properly and needed a little help from me -LRB- though thick paper like this is not listed in the types of paper this printer can handle - so the problem was really me trying to use this for the wrong application -RRB- . 	Printer
Hp printers generally fail within 3 years , this one failed within 3 months . They suck . When I called support they said if I wanted a machine that scans properly , I 'd have to buy an officejet -LRB- more expensive -RRB- . Nevermind that this product has a scanner built in . Stay away from HP if you want quality 	Printer
I 've been amazed at this printer . It was given to me by a friend who tired of it and wanted color . I have had many types of printers , but always black and white AND COLOR . The ink leaked out of some and the powder spilled . This has never had a paper jam unless I really caused it ; and then it 's easy to clear . The cartridge drops right in if you put it in properly . I 've had only one cartridge for two years and use it very often . If color is not important to you , do n't waste your money on a more sophisticated printer . But , it will print colored pictures in black and white . Only thing I have n't figured out yet is to stop printing if I hit the print button more than once . I just purchased a HP Photosmart printer to use for color prints and photos , hoping that it will be just as reliable as this one . This is the first printer that has never caused a problem .

Despite my reluctance to buy this product after reading a couple bad reviews , I 'm really glad I went through with the purchase . Item arrived in a timely fashion and I did n't even need to use the CD since I 'm running Win7 . Great solution for $ 15 including shipping , when the only cable like this at my local B-Buy cost $ 35 !!! Thanks Sabrent ! 	Printer
The capacity of this machine is so unimpressive that it leaves you wondering who they had in mind when they called it a business jet . The number of pages in the tray is minute , but the amount printing that can be done with the mini ink cartridges is underwhelming . You then realize the cost involved with replacing them , not long thereafter comes the whopping cost of replacing the print heads . HP shareholders may rest assured that customers are forced to come back for more and more and more . But will they ever want to buy another HP printer . Both thumbs firmly down . 	Printer
First of all I 'm not a professional photographer , but I do enjoy using my canon dslr and retouching my old family photos . I found this epson printer to be awesome for that . I 've scanned , done a basic retouch in iphoto , and printed to epson photo paper . For the 4x6 photos ive been very happy with the color and depth . I have n't experienced any problems with excessive ink use when the printer does it calibration\/cleaning\/purging . Though I 'm not looking forward to buying the pricey inks , the quality of the photos is so far offsetting that fear . My friend thought it was weird that i did n't get a canon printer for its direct connection\/synching . Its kinda superfluous though , because theres a card reader which is actually easier than searching for the stupid cord . Setup : Surprisingly lengthy but easy . Instead of just loading all the software on my mac , it asked me about 7 times if it could load various programs , unfortunately it does n't tell you what its loading so its kinda hard to say no. . Fortunately there no annoying programs that pop up and annoy me with a `` reminder '' thats really just an ad . Wireless setup was super easy i just selected my router 's name and entered the password . my mac found the printer easily also . Software : easy to use . The epson is wireless -LRB- i hate wires\/cords -RRB- , double click on the icon -LRB- i drug it on my tool bar temporarily -RRB- and then clicked the scan button in the window . The weird thing is its closes after each scan and you have to re-open it which is why its better to put it on your desktop or task bar . Other than that its easy and automatically recognizes what your scanning and will adjust appropriately , you can also customize and save settings if you want . There 's also the myepson that lets you make custom notepaper , cards and the like with extra designs available online for free . I havent really experimented with it too much , but the notepaper with my dog on it was kinda cool . Hardware : The build is a bit flimsy especially the paper tray and top lid . I think its going to be fine , for my light to moderate use . There 's no paper feeder so if you plan on doing lots of scanning a feeder might be better for you . The buttons and menu are easy to read and intuitive . The memory card reader is great and that its wireless to my mac -LRB- which has no built in card reader -RRB- is a nice bonus because i lose my thumb-drive sd card reader all the time . Theres an ability to print cd\/dvds if you have printable ones -LRB- comes with one disc -RRB- , you just push a dedicated button to open the special tray , looks easy , but I do n't have any plans to print them since i either use my ipod for music or email photos , but I 'm sure itd be great for people who love making discs . Bonus : came with an extra container of black ink . I can print photos from my iphone directly to the printer . Theres a free app , that lets you print any photo in your iphone album , you can select print size , border or not , or even print to regular paper . I 've printed a few to 4x6 and was impressed that it actually looked better than the iphone screen . Unfortunately you ca n't print notes or documents . Theres another app i saw in the app store that allows you to print more than photos , but I 'm hesitant to try it . I 'm unsure if those apps work on an itouch , but i 'd imagine it would since its wifi enabled . 	Printer
This is an outstanding bit of techno wizardry . We bought it for Mom 's trip to Europe with 4 box 's of 108 prints . Based on past experience we figured out the cost per picture and this was an easy winner for us . If the device survives past the first 400 prints we are in the cream ! The BAD first ... 1 . This IS a stand alone unit - you do NOT need a computer to use it . BUT REPEAT BUT if you do want to print from your computer - say after taking out that red eye - you MUST be running MS XP or VISTA . There are NO supports for Linux or those other older OS 's . That 's why it only gets 3 stars . So much for backwards compatible , free markets etc. ... 2 . The paper tray is flimsy and poorly designed watch you do n't break it . 3 . Canon has a bad habit of NOT supporting its printer products . We have Canon printers that lack only 15 cent parts but Canons way is to buy a whole new unit . Our plan - and advise to the buyer - is to buy up front for a one time use . Canon printers do not like to sit idle nor age well so if you wont get your value in the first 6 months you run a very real risk of dissatisfaction . The GOOD ... This baby rocks . Period . 1 . Clear crisp prints faster than the old polaroids and excellent color . 2 . The thing is so simple my brother could n't screw it up . A real joy in high tech , just plug it in and it works ! 3 . The print media is all but fool proof and the whole set up takes about 1\/2 a cup of coffee even if you refuse to read the instructions . 4 . We are very pleased to report that this is just as it advertised 1,2,3 simple - insert card , select image and hit print . That simple and easy . 5 . The test sheets are post cards . That means you can send that picture of your finger in front of Old Faithful to your kids before you leave the park ... oh the fun we will have with this ! 6 . The unit is JUST small enough to take in a camera bag but very nice for cluttered desks with enough cord for the coffee table . You can pick the unit up and look close at the little screen deciding if you want to print that picture of your sister giving you that raspberry without needing a gym membership nor endangering the units functions . 6.25 a If you are willing to use MS XP or later you can have way more fun with this thing than is legal in some places . Given the pace we should see this device with a far bigger LCD in a year and real cross platform function before that . This is one device that waiting will probably pay off with but at under $ 100 it 's a really good TOY buy with the above in mind . If it turns out to be a really good tool as well thats all to the good . We shall see ... We have had to drag mother into the digital era . Toys like this make it easy and fun for her at a price point per picture that lets her fiddle and try things . 	Printer
Unbelivable Pics better than studio pics . <p> If you want LCD , ability to print from Memory , go with I900D If you wanter faster prints , go with this I960 . <p> Both have same technology except for the diff i pointed out . 	Printer

I 've had my Z1 for several years now , and gone through many discs with it . Here 's my experience , and tips for getting the best out of your Z1 . Overall , I love this printer . It has worked quite well for me since the day I got it . To date I must have put 500 discs through it . The Z1 uses a monochrome thermal ink cartridge to mark the disc . Unlike inkjet technology , the thermal print is not water-soluble , and will not rub or wash off . Even hard scratching with fingernails is not enough to damage the print . To me , this is a big advantage over inkjet . The software only allows printing inside of four quadrants on the disc - upper , lower , left and right . Each quadrant is a rectangular area . Printing completely around the disc circumference is therefore not possible . Still , this is better than some similar printers , which only allow you to print in two areas on the disc -LRB- top and bottom -RRB- . Since the print mechanism uses a ribbon-type cartridge , and not an ink cartridge , full-color printing is not possible . You can get single colors other than black , although I 've never tried them . The printer is designed to take normal - that is , non-inkjet-printable - media . I do n't know what would happen if you tried inkjet-printable media in it , as the thermal printing only sticks to certain types of surfaces . Unfortunately , there is really no way to know if the printer will print effectively on any given type of disc . Most online retailers sell a variety of media that have no markings on the top surface . When used properly , the output is really quite impressive , as far as it goes - or at least I think so , and my friends agree . Importing graphics and such is easy , so it 's possible to harvest clipart from DVD covers and online images to create pretty good-looking discs . Some people have complained about the grayscale graphics quality . Truth be told , the printer does not do well on high-contrast images , or images with a lot of black . I find it best to lower the image contrast and raise the brightness by about 30 % or so before trying to print an image . Most of the time it does OK . Sometimes it does good , and occasionally it does really well . Image manipulation outside the printing program can really help the final graphics output . So yes , it 's limited in some ways . But I dare you to find anything better for the price , or even four times the price . Sure , if you need color and do n't mind smearing , an inkjet would be better . But for me , this little gadget is just what the doctor ordered . 	Printer
I have mine set up with my Powerbook -LRB- Mac -RRB- and it is easy to set up , prints really fast , and produces nice pictures ; all at a reasonable price . really satisfied . 	Printer
I have spent 10 hours trying to get the Epson Artisan 835 set up to print , and to be accessed by other computers in my homegroup . I did get the ink cartridges installed , and apparently got the fax driver installed . I have never needed to fax a document from a computer . I am going to eat some dinner -LRB- it 's 9:36 p.m. -RRB- I may try again tomorrow , but at the first sign of a problem , I will place this beautiful -LRB- looks are n't everything -RRB- black plastic box in the well designed shipping carton back to Amazon . This will be the first time I have ever had to return anything to Amazon . It will also be the first time i 've had any problem with an Epson product . In sixteen plus years I have had two epson printers , an Epson Stylus ESC\/2 that lasted ten years -LRB- paid $ 399.00 for it -RRB- . And an Epson Stylus CX 5400 that is almost out of ink . I had ordered the large six-pack of ink for the Artisan , and I am very close to returning it , and getting ink for the CX5400 . The Artisan would have printed nice photos of my recently deceased parents , but Wal-Mart or Walgreens can do the same thing cheaper , and with much less hassel . It depends on how well I sleep tonight . 	Printer
Great print quality on premium glossy photo paper when you look at them directly - but terrible when you looked at them from an angle . They look splotchy and not `` glossy '' . Epson kind of acknowledges this but says it will look better on matt or semi-matt papers . <p> Windows XP driver default installation caused my machine to reboot spontaneously . I thought my computer was broken ! The driver needs to be partially uninstalled to work , but then it works fine . <p> Could n't find ICM color profiles after installing the software , but you can get them from Epson UK or Australia web sites . <p> Could n't find a color profile for the ColorLife paper .

I am a senior software developer at a healthcare IT company . Our customers requested a specific type of report which needed to be printed on 11x17 paper . We had no such printer in-house . I did some research , found this printer at HP , ordered it from Amazon and had it in my hands in 2 days . It took about 20 minutes to hook up and I had my 11x17 report which I can now forward on to my customers . The service was incredible and the printer is perfect for my needs ! 	Printer
Machines were set up next to each other . . I ran both black and color samples in all 3 modes ... the hp 750 cost -LRB- cost -RRB- more but Lexmark had supposedly higher resolution . Both color and black came out better on the hp . . Salesman was pushing the lexmark telling me it came with full ink and not started ink like hp . Also was told the paper transport was better by lexmark ... However Here is what i liked about hp . 1 -RRB- Higher support frame so copy stays on flat bed better -LRB- the top and bottoms -RRB- .2 -RRB- Much faster !! Better quality copies in every mode . Is it worth the -LRB- cost -RRB- extra ... only if speed and quality matter . ... 	Printer
Somewhat slow and text documents not quite as crisp as from a single function printer ; but impressive overall at a superb price . 	Printer
It is easy to install with Windows XP . No need to worry about using camera software or hook ups and wasting camera batteries . It saves pictures to your PC for you . It also prints beautiful photographs on any paper , and it is selling out like crazy . I grabbed the last one on the shelf at Walmart . Circuit City is sold out . Trust me , get it and sit back and relax . 	Printer
I bought the C62 about a year ago and am now looking for a new printer that wo n't constantly be running out of ink . To make it worse , the printer gets a little low on ink and then refuses to print anything until you install new cartridges . Print quality , ease of use , etc is fine , but that should be the case with any printer . I have an HP 880c at work that seems to go forever on a set of cartidges , so I 'll be shopping for an HP this time . 	Printer
As the Technology Specialist in a school , I install a lot of printers . But this printer is the worst I 've ever seen . The paper output goes through a ridiculously teeny slit that does not allow for even the slightest bend in the paper surface . If the paper is not absolutely pristinely flat , it jams , and jams bad . Usually you can easily open the printer and pull the jammed paper out but this model had no way to open it and get the jam out . -LRB- Maybe it does , but I could n't find it . -RRB- Whoever designed this particular model was completely devoid of common sense . In general , we used to buy only HP printers but over the last 6 years HP 's reliability has plummeted , in my opinion . Their psc 's and aio 's never last long . I 've begun to buy only Epson 's now and have not yet been disappointed . Try the Epson Stylus NX625 ! 	Printer
The HP Photosmart Plus B210 goes through the ink too fast - or they do n't put much ink in the cartridges . The `` at purchase '' cartridge only lasted a few weeks - the 564XL was n't much better . We did not count the pages printed - but we do n't print very often\/much . We 've gone through the initial cartridge and are on our forth cartridge in only a few months -LRB- less than 100 pages printed total -RRB- . 	Printer
This printer was cheap and prints decently . That is the positive . On the downside , it uses a ton of ink , the ink is expensive , and I had to reinstall the printer on both computers in my house repeatedly - like 10 times on one computer . I replaced it with an Epson WorkForce 845 , which came with high-capacity ink cartridges and has a 30 sheet document feeder on the scanner . The Epson ink is much cheaper and I think the printing looks better . I 'll never buy an HP inkjet again . 	Printer
This unit is loud when the paper is feeding , but when working the prints are very good but the ink jets clog easly . My first unit ink nozels quit working under warranty and EPSON sent a replacement and this unit lasted about 6 months and not that unit is not printing so I will not purchase another 5200 . 	Printer
The delivery time was about 5 days . Pretty good for free shipping . 	Printer
I 've had this printer since July and I 'm still on the stock ink cartridges . I 'm purposely trying to run them out because I just bought a CSS system from inkproducts.com that I want to install . I 've printed up around 500 pages , maybe more . Yesterday I got the ` black ink almost out ' warning and I 've printed 250 pages since -LRB- color , but mostly black text -RRB- , it still has n't run out . Besides the awesome ink usage ... this printer has a ton of settings that make it great . It does everything I need it to . I love the auto 2-sided feature . The wireless feature is also great , have n't had any problems . 	Printer
I was just wanting an inexpensive printer for general use . Only prints in black and white but does n't have any cartridges to dry out . 	Printer
It was quick delivery . And it is working as to what it is supposed to be . I like the price and performance . I recommended it ! 	Printer
The Canon S-630 is such a quality printer , I do n't know why anyone would shop else where ! It has good speed while printing text or photos . But the best part is the ink cost . I only replace the color I used and at -LRB- $ -RRB- per color or -LRB- $ -RRB- for all 3 colors and the black , why pay -LRB- $ -RRB- for HP 's 3-colors , with less than half the amount of ink in its cartridge than canons . You can waste your money if you want , I 'm sticking with the S-630 . 	Printer
Within a few months after purchase printer head died . Thought I was just unlucky , forked out a cool -LRB- $ $ $ -RRB- for a new printer head -LRB- my second bad move -RRB- . Printer head this time lasted about a year and a half with minimal use . Consumption of ink is excessive and therefore costly . The number of bad reviews for this printer sums it all . Just because it says its a `` canon '' do not be fooled . Buyer beware ! 	Printer
I am absolutely satisfied with the performance of the printer . Excellent quality and LOTS of functionality . Imagine my disdain when looking for a color cartridge I found out The rollback had it -LRB- not on sale -RRB- for 30 dollars less ... Still a great printer ! 	Printer
This printer does not even qualify for one star . HP is a world leader . They build the worst printers which even they ca n't fix . They have the worst and most incompetent tech support manned by illiterates who ca n't speak English . Their escalation team -LRB- customer service -RRB- is the most uncaring and dishonest group I 've ever been involved with . I bought my 309g in Dec 2010 and installed it in Jan 2011 . My first call to tech support was Jan 17 , 2011 and was followed by eight to twelve more calls over the next year , all about the same problem . The machine refused to print unless -LRB- 1 -RRB- I reset the printer -LRB- 2 -RRB- I closed the program I was using -LRB- 3 -RRB- I closed everything and restarted the computer -LRB- 4 -RRB- I would have to check and see if the driver had disappeared , which it did many times , download and re-install . Sometimes one of these would coax it to print , sometimes it required all . It 's ink consumption was unbelievable , easily the worst I 've ever seen . It used three sets of cartridges while only working perhaps two months out of twelve . There is a lot more to this horror story but I 'm not going into all the lies from customer support and how the record of my calls to tech support suddenly disappeared so they did n't believe I ever had a problem and therefore refused any help except being willing to sell me a new Envy printer for $ 150 . when I could purchase it here for $ 165 . Fifteen dollars for one year of a defective product . I 'm not insane enough to have another from HP . It seems the escalation dept is there only to stall and irritate and lie until they 're sure you will never buy HP again . They are very successful . Be warned . 	Printer
I do a lot of printing and was tired of paying `` color print '' prices for a lot of text printing so I ordered the HP Laserjet 1018 printer . I have been extremely pleased with the quality of the print and the speed of the printer . The pages do curl when they first come out of the printer but I expected this . If you lay them flat and wait until they cool , they do flatten out . This has been NO PROBLEM for me . I have owned the printer for three months and have not replaced the cartridge , and I do a LOT of printing for a class I teach . I did find that I have printer problems if I have both my color and laser jet printer turned on at the same time . The problem was solved by leaving the printers turned off until I get ready to print and not having the printers in the `` on '' position simultaneously . The title says it all - I love this printer . 	Printer
I am SOOOO disappointed in this printer , I ca n't even begin to tell you . I used to have an HP694C and when I got a new computer , I ordered the Dell 922 printer . At first I was quite happy with my purchase and thought I had gotten a real bargain since it had a scanner and copier built in . The job did n't last long , though . I have had constant paper jams with this printer . Either several pages come through at once , the paper jams , or the page wo n't come through at all . Once in a while I have trouble free printing , but that is the exception , rather than the rule . I feel that the cartridges get used up rather quickly and are quite expensive . I get so annoyed every time I try to print something that I have given up and decided to look for a new printer and throw this one in the garbage . I would give it away but I do n't want anyone else to suffer the way I have with it . 	Printer
Most of these reviews are written by new owners . I loooooved this printer at the beginning , too . After 300pp , however , the toner light came on , will not go off , and it will not print . I went online and found HUNDREDS of owners bewailing the same fate . I tried all the recommended fixes , including buying yet ANOTHER new cartridge . I called Tech Support at Brother and they were unhelpful , unsympathetic , and rude . Tomorrow I take it into the repair shop . But I think this is a pile of junk . I HIGHLY regret buying it . 	Printer
A simple , light weight , easy to use , portable , uncomplicated little printer . For the price , the performance is fabulous . I gave it a 5 star in this category of printers . If I want wireless and photo quality printing I 'll get an alternative . Great little printer and the price and prompt delivery service was great from Amazon . hp could have thrown in the usb cable as an extra , though . But hey , I 'm a satisfied Amazon customer !! I 'm getting to love the Amazon experience . 	Printer
When my trusty 10-year old HP LaserJet IIIP suddenly gave up the ghost , I had to find a replacement for my small office quick . Although considering another HP laser , I did check out PC-World and Consumer Reports -- good thing ! Both listed the Brother 1440 as tops ; after checking out the specs , I settled on its slightly more versatile cousin with 8 MB RAM and duplex printing -- the model HL-1450 . Turned out that , at Amazon 's special price , the better performer cost less than the introductory printer . <p> I 've now printed some 1000 pages on the 1450 , and am tickled slap to death with it . Fast , quiet , low cost per page , reliable , numerous fancy print options ; the single feeder is great for envelopes or check printing , and the paper tray holds 250 sheets . I added a 32 MB SIMM for graphics printing - DO NOT buy the -LRB- price -RRB- Brother SIMM , get it on line for -LRB- money -RRB- ! <p> The setup sheet is excellent , as are the installation graphics on the CD . My one beef is that the ` manual ' resides on the CD , so you have to have a functioning computer and printer to use it . The user manual 's index stinks -LRB- try finding `` sleep mode '' -RRB- but the contents and illustrations are excellent . All told , for under -LRB- price -RRB- I got a super laser printer for the office . <p> ... 	Printer
This machine makes pretty color copies and was easy to setup and use . However , it is so slow ! Whether you are printing or copying in color or black and white it is slow . It takes forever for the machine to wake up , it takes forever to change functions , and the print speed is slow . Also , when I send large docs or pics to print , sometimes it does n't print because the file is too large . I do n't know if that is common with all wireless printers or just this one ... Also , if your main function is going to be copying , I would n't reccomend this one because I 'm going through ink cartridges much faster than I ever used toner . 	Printer
I 've had my fair share of good to pretty decent printers over the years , and this is my first Epson -- and if my experience is any guide , it will definitely not be my last . First off , lets start with ease of set-up . I 've had printers which required -LRB- practically -RRB- a degree from M.I.T. in order to hook up and work properly , and I 've had some which were ridiculously simple to operate ... although most of those were just plain cheap -- and I mean quality as well as price ... in other words , between my personal experience at home and at work , I 've used a lot of printers -LRB- as most people do these days -RRB- . The Artisan 730 was a real snap to set up . Simple as can be outside of the machine figuring out how to do it all by itself . The quality of the product upon first un-boxing it was one of profound quality , especially considering how economical the price tag is . I 've purchased several home printers which were priced MUCH higher and were less than half as impressive with the build quality . The adjustable touch-screen is just plain cool . I 'll be honest , after using a touch screen cell phone for as long as I have , it was beginning to feel as though anything that did n't come with something similar would be a plain waste -- nice to see that Epson did not cheat us on quality . Just about everything screams awesome with this printer . From the wireless printing capabilities -- which are absolutely just plain SWEET IMO . When I first had seen a commercial bragging of this ability , I just thought it was a novelty which -- while cool , was n't exactly an ` Extra ' that would be all that practical in the end . Let me say right now that I was WRONG . Once you use it , well you will never want another printer where that is n't an option . Oh ... and the pics ?? -LRB- yes , it DOES print them btw -RRB- They are simply amazing . The color saturation is very well done ... oh , and VERY fast , too . It brags as the fastest photo printer available on the market today , and while I 've never timed that particular feature before , it really IS quite rapid , especially compared with previous printers I 've owned in the past which also were very good -- just not nearly as quick . What can I say ? If you are looking for a quality , all-in-one copier\/printer which you can own without breaking the bank ... look NO FURTHER . I believe I 've found what you 've been looking for . Kudos to Epson , this model is quite literally a true winner . 	Printer
Apparently this model and several other HP printers have a fatal flaw - at some point one color or another no longer prints . For me it was black . I tried replacing the black cartridge several times -- using HP-brand cartridges mind you -- and although they were detected and indicated as full , black still would n't print . No problem with the other colors , but what use is a printer that does n't print black ? I contacted HP support and after running me through steps I had already taken - rebooting the printer , cleaning the heads , rebooting again , etc - was told that I could get a discount on a new printer . Sound familiar ? Why would I buy another printer from HP when this one stopped working for no apparent reason ? I had no issues with this printer until now . I 'm truly disappointed . 	Printer
Do yourself a favor - do n't purchase this printer . Paid the extra money for overnight shipping . Out of the box the epson WP-4540 did not work . After 30 minute tech call I 'm told they will ship new ink cartidge . One week later no ink cartidge . Another 30 minute call , I 'm told epson has no ink , does n't know when they will have my ink . I call corporate , 12 minute call , they send ink 2 days later . Ink arrives , does n't solve problem . Another 30 minute tech call , they will send more ink , I should expect it in 5 days . I ca n't print , I ca n't scan , I ca n't copy . Thank you epson . 	Printer
I set this printer up in 5-10 minutes . Very impressed with the quality . Overall a great product for an awesome price . 	Printer
I just got this and set it up today . Setup was easy and without any problems . On first glance , print quality looks good , and everything seems to work like it should . I 'm buying this printer to replace a Lexmark laser whose annual toner budget was out of control . Things I like about inkjet printers : lower consumable cost than laser -LRB- 4 ink cartridges cost about what one toner cartridge would cost -RRB- ; lower electricity consumption -LRB- this Epson uses about 3 watts in standby mode as measured by my Kill-O-Watt -RRB- ; and usually better photo print quality . This Epson is way faster than other inkjets I 've used in the past -- a simple B&W text document printed in two sided mode spits out in seconds . Color does n't take much longer . The big drawback I 've had with other inkjets is cartridges drying up from disuse . Only time will tell if that is an issue with this unit . 	Printer
Bought this printer after a lot of shopping and it works very well , takes up little space on the desk - but only after getting it set up , which could be a lot simpler ! The paper instruction manual does n't offer much information . Though it is a wireless printer , I did need a cable USB connected to my Mac computer for the installation and wireless set up . This is not at all clear from the paper manual or in the disk instructions , nor does a cable come with the printer . In any event , do n't connect the USB cable until it 's time to set up the wireless connection . There 's also the ability to E-print remotely , though this feature is not something I need at this time . The printer uses ink cartridges that are individually installed so that if you 're out of yellow , for example , you just replace yellow . Not sure yet if this will be a good feature . It will NOT use the XL cartridge size . Like so many new devices , the printer\/scanner\/copier has more features than the average person probably will use , but are there just in case . I definitely wanted copying and scanning , which work very well . The print quality is excellent and works very smoothly with my Mac . It does print envelopes also , though it took a bit of experimentation to figure out how , since I could n't find any help for that ! My old printer had a diagram for envelope placement , but this one does not . The main problem with this printer seems to be in the lack of complete instructions regarding setup . HP offers customer feedback and I did comment on this . 	Printer
Great photos , inks are in seperate tanks , very good b\/w photos , easy to use . reliable ... so far . The only thing I would like to see is a system that synchronizes what you see on the monitor with the pics this printer produces . Monitor to printer calibration systems are more costly than the printer itself . Rumor has it that if you wait a year or two , this technology will be incorporated into the next generation of printers . We shall see . 	Printer
"I had an HP but it was a DOG . At about 9 months I just threw it away . The Lexmark 705 was priced right and arrived a day ahead of schedule . It was easy to set up and the telephone help was excellent . It is quiet , fast and totally unobtrusive . The difference between it and my previous printer is astounding . This is our second Lexmark and we 're happy with both of them . <ahref=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002NKMGDY/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/180-2516160-9995608""> Lexmark Prevail Pro705 Small Office Wireless Multifunction Inkjet Printer </a> "	Printer
I have to say I was a bit hesitant after some of the harsh reviews given to this printer . Common sense won out ; I had my old HP All in one 5500 for four years and it has outlasted , out printed Canon 's , Epson 's and many more in that time to STILL keeps on printing perfectly . I needed a printer with more paper capacity and would work on a wireless network . I can say that this printer has indeed lived up to it 's hype and defied it 's critics nicely ; the printer works perfectly -LRB- even the wireless ability worked first try without problems -RRB- , has shown it uses ink slowly and is easy to use . I can now print from anywhere in the house without wires and without the high cost of other printers . This printer claims it is cheaper than a laser to use and I can say that so far , that is true . After you get the unit assembled -LRB- about 20 to 30 minutes out of the box -RRB- , the two things that you need to keep in mind about this printer is that it is HUGE and will need a bit of space . The second thing is that it is noisy , as many HP 's are . If you can life with those two small drawbacks , you will be very happy to own one of these . If you have already owned an HP printer before , you will find that this one lives up to the HP standard of excellence . That 's my two-cents , hope it helped . 	Printer
Everytime I replace the ink cartridges I have issues ... the printer does n't recognize the new toner ... the documents sent to the printer just hang in the spool , I do n't get any error codes -LRB- on Mac -RRB- ... this is a poorly engineered piece of % ^ $ % ^ % \* ! 	Printer
I purchased this for the home office . It was extremely easy to set up . The wireless convenience is amazing , especially with two laptops roaming around . It prints fast enough and the color and quality is impressive . 	Printer
I am really impressed with the printer , especially the photo capabilities . I copied a picture on just regular paper and it came out great . It is fast and fairly easy to figure out . 	Printer
I purchased this computer at Amazon . It is simple , cheap , does what I want it to do . Prints come out looking good . A good buy at the price . 	Printer
One thing I missed from this piece is FAX . My previous HP printer had fax , so I assumed when it is labeled as `` All-In-One '' fax is included . No , FAX is NOT . But when you have cellular\/twitter\/facebook , etc. you may not need fax anymore . The only thing I did was to send a message to people who in the past communicated via fax , which turned out to be only one . Otherwise , I am totally amazed by the ease of connecting the equipment into my system . So easy , you can do it in a flash of second ! Size fits nicely with my stand and neat and elegant appearance matches very nicely . I like this machine , including programs . Cost performance is excellent . 	Printer
I love this printer . Great quality and dirt cheap cartridges . Takes 4 cartridges , one for each color . Each lasts a long time and only costs a couple bucks on the third party market . Much much less expensive to operate than other name brand printers . 	Printer
Good printer for the price . Set-up simple . Printer turns itself off if not used for a while which I like as I generally forget to turn printers off at night . Prints both sides easily . Good value . $ 25 less at Amazon than office supply stores . 	Printer
I recently installed this cartridge into my printer and it 's worse than what I took out . The print is not even with respect to density and sharpness . Toner is deposited randomly on the paper . I know it 's not the printer because I did n't have that problem before I inserted this replacement . I ran about 30 copies to see if the problem would clear up . Well it did n't . In fact , the printed copies look as though the cartridge ran out of toner because they 're very light and faint . I 'm very disappointed to say the least . I need a quality print now , not later .

This little projector is perfect for someone looking to have a home theater on a budget . I admit , I was not expecting too much out of this thing when I ordered it . After all , you get what you pay for , right ? In this case , you get a whole lot more ! The picture is great , to begin with . Out of the box , I adjusted the manual focus -LRB- yes , manual -RRB- and tweaked the picture settings with the included remote . Within five minutes , I had a phenomenal 120 '' image -LRB- just on a white wall , too . I 'll edit this soon , once I get my `` real screen '' -RRB- . Whether its DVD or Bluray , Xbox 360 , WII or PS2 -LRB- no PS3 -RRB- , the picture is well above what I EVER expected . For $ 250 , this little projector is a steal ! PROS : + Great picture + Easy to set up and adjust + A lot quieter than I expected + NEVER heats up , no matter how long its on CONS : - Built in speakers sound terrible -LRB- but who cares ? You do n't buy a projector for speakers ! -RRB- - No way to adjust settings without the remote . OVERALL : Buy this projector . You will not regret it !! 	Projector
I bought this product and it has been excellent , easy to use , video cable is included , the control works fine . Any issue with the product . 	Projector
Cant beat the price . Nice smooth surface . No wrinkles . Pulls up and down nice and smoothly . I am just amazed I got a screen so large for $ 110 delivered . I 'm tempted to get another and put it away in case I need another later . Looks well made . Nice and solid . When you pull down screen , it locks into position with very little effort . 	Projector
Its going to be almost 2 weeks since I purchased this projector . Watching movies is great on this projector . I am using my wall for the projection which has got grainy surface . Picture quality and details are awesome . I was shocked to see such clarity even on a grainy surface . I tried to run this during daytime and did n't found it doing very good in the light even when blinds are closed . I have to close curtains for it . This can be ignored as optimum use of this projector is only when you are watching movies , and movies give feel on such big screens only after room is perfectly dark . I will not reduce any star because of this . The only heart breaker with this projector and I believe with all the 3D ready projectors sold today is the extra hardware for viewing 3D contents . It really makes no sense to purchase a 3D ready projector for 600 even $ & then purchase a converter kind of device of almost same amount of the projector in order to watch 3D movie on a 3D ready projector . I am giving 3 stars just because of this additional hardware 3D-XL . If I ignore this then definitely this projector is 5 star . And why the 3D-XL device is more costly than compared to UK and even does not comes with the pair of glasses while the UK one comes . I am not a very techy person for audio and visuals but I understand that this 3D XL box will do some sequencing of frames in order to show right and left frames sequentially . This is more a firmware upgrade . Since most of us has recently bought this device hence in my opinion Optoma should do this firmware update free of cost as most the mobile companies do these days . The only real issue seems to me currently most 3D players has output of HDMI v1 .4 while the HD 66 supports input of HDMI v 1.3 . It 's really feels cheated that Optoma is asking to purchase a full box instead of a small HDMI v1 .4 to v1 .3 converter and asking for a whopping 500 $ . For me is seems like I am asked to purchase one HD 66 on discounted price . It will feel like OPTOMA is cheating us . ## update on 21 Dec 2010 ## In amazon UK site this product is sold just 249euro which is equal to 327.5 $ . UK version ships following below given item in the box . -LRB- ... -RRB- Box Contains # 3D projector adapter # Power Plug # Power Adapter # User Guide -LRB- CD -RRB- # Quick Start Card # Warranty Card # WEEE card # 3D Glasses # CR2032 battery # Large\/small interchangeable nosepieces updated on 9\/19\/2011 Updated to 4 stars as picture quality is awesome .

This mount works exactly as stated and is infinitely adaptable up to a certain point - the adjustable `` legs '' extend out to increase the overall circumference ... sorry I did n't measure the maximal span BUT in my case , it was about an inch short of being wide enough to span the mounting holes on the Epson Powerlite 8350 that I bought it for . HOWEVER , the company DOES sell longer `` legs '' for a couple of dollars each , or there is an alternative model # that comes with longer extension legs ... but some swift searching on Amazon shows you that these options are not available via Amazon `` Prime '' vendors , and I did n't have time to mess about sending stuff back , so ... HOWEVER -LRB- 2 -RRB- if you have four short nuts & bolts to spare -LRB- trip to Home Depot Hardware for such a pack - quarter inch circumference by 1 inch long + 4 washers -RRB- you can just join two of the `` long '' legs to two of the additional `` short legs '' that are pre-supplied in the kit and the resulting extra reach does span the gap perfectly well to accommodate said Epson 8350 projector . I will upload a photo -LRB- picture worth a thousand words -RRB- ` cos this is a quick & handy fix for loads of others who wrote about this piece of kit not being suitable for the Epson 8350 when Amazon is unwittingly displaying it in the `` what other people bought when they purchased this item '' type of section when you buy an Epson 8350 . Hope this helps - otherwise , it 's sturdy enough and I should also add it is infinately adjustable for side-to-side leveling , front-to-back leveling , has an extender bar if you need to drop it down from a high ceiling and also has a pivoting plate that attaches to the ceiling to accomodate an angled vaulted ceiling like we have . Go for it , but not if you have an Epson 8350 and you DO N'T want to mess about with the afore-mentioned 4 extra nuts & bolts like I used -LRB- hence the 4 star & not 5 -RRB- ... but in all honesty if you can put the thing together in the first place , you can just as easily add four extra bolts & save yourself $ 20 or so vs the other model with the `` long legs '' . Ooh-err , missus . 	Projector
i gave it a 3 star because : it needs total darkness to be clear . a bit inconvenient for that reason : all what i needed it for was to present in class usually during morning time therefore didnt really help me . Also , for an artist i need that sharpness when presenting text or images . it is clear but wasnt as sharp as i hoped for . However , I loved that I had it , its good for presenting and personal use -LRB- large screen movie night -RRB- - maybe . however , my rating was based on how this device met my own requirements \/ expectations . its about 50 '' wide . you need to buy the hook-ups to what you want to hook it up to . but it is pretty easy to do so & find . 	Projector
I opened the box and hooked it up to my macbook pro . It is a very good , clear picture and will work fantastic for presentations . No brains needed to get it working 	Projector
the product works real well and I have not had any problem with the product . 	Projector
The projected image is very bad . It is blurry even after focusing & the colors are faded . It would not pick up a signal with the HDMI connection . I am hoping to return but the seller has a long list of non returnable items , including TVs . It is bright enough but what an awful image . The only way to adjust the projection size is to move the projector . For the price I knew it would n't be perfect but it would n't be worth watching if it were free . 	Projector
Do n't get me wrong the projector is AWSOME great picture quality and this is my first Panasonic & projector experience , usually I ` m royal customer to SONY . ONLY thing is REAL AWFUL makes me hate this projector and Panasonic company . . Is customer service\/Tech support ! I just bought this projector arrived around x-mas I called many times to Panasonic Tech support and customer service , CAN NOT find anyone support this projector , They transfer me to this guy and that guy , put me on hold alots times and put me on hold again for long minutes to read PJ manual some where , thats thing i can do myself , Then they took my phone number 100times to someone calls me back and NEVER gets any calls back from anyone , because they do n't know S. About the PJ & NOT trained whatsoever & comes to it PANASONIC dose NOT have any supports for thire projectors line up ! , STILL waiting for calls then again same old paste over & over . .

I Bought this projector a few months ago not knowing what to expect , I paid the same price as I did for my Plasma TV . This thing is amazing for Gaming and movies from a blu-ray player or computer . Hooking it up to a HD cable service is n't the best . as it kinda looks like a standard definition even through the HDMI cord . hooking it up to a VCR or using the RCA cords is n't that good . The speakers in the system are only good for small rooms . No need really for a projector screen , it looks really good even on my dirty white walls , or the blue wall in showed it on . Although the screen does make it easier to look at . and doesnt give you as bad of `` movie theater eyes '' In a small room no need to have a heater on , as this thing pumps out more heat than a space heater . No zoom option which is kinda rough to deal with . But this is the highest quality projector for the price at the time of purchase . I will update if I have any further comments on here . 	Projector
I selected this projector based on discussions with my two children , both of whom have projectors . I was most concerned about the ability to project through ambient light as this was cited as the most annoying problem they had experienced . My projector is situated about 25 feet from the screen and light streams into the room through two french doors and two sky lights . The BenQ W6000 easily handles this and projects a highly watchable 12 ft picture . Of course during the evening with the lights turned downed the picture rivals and in many cases is better than what you will find in your average neighborhood theater . Its got just about every connector port imaginable including VGA , 2xHDMI , RCA Video , Component and S-Video . This projector may be more expensive than a lot of the projectors available but it is well worth the extra price . I paid about $ 300 more from Amazon than it is now being offered for and I felt it was a bargain at that price . Now it is even more affordable . 	Projector
I 've never written an Amazon review before , but I 've learned a lot about projectors over the past couple weeks , and thought I should share . As prices have been coming down , I finally decide to get a projector . 720p was plenty good for me . After reading plenty of reviews here and the various projector websites out there I narrowed my search down to the Optoma HD66 and the Epson 705HD , both going for + \/ - $ 650 at the time of this writing , and both highly rated . A bit about me - I 'm not a projector or electronics nut , but I do appreciate knowing that I have the best -LRB- or better -RRB- of what 's out there when I do buy things of significant $ $ $ . Male , early 30 's . Do n't watch any TV , just the occasional movie at home . After much fuss , I decided to order the Epson . It seemed to have more features , had longer bulb life , and in the end I figured since I 'm no projector connoisseur I would be more than impressed with its performance . However , I was not blown away enough , so I ordered the Optoma . I am keeping the Optoma , and returning the Epson . I tested both using a connection to my old Mac Powerbook G4 laptop , projecting onto a white wall painted matte white . Here is what I learned : Epson 705HD : - LCD technology really does display `` little pixels '' that are visible if you are up close . Not really a big deal with a movie where things are moving all the time . - Significantly brighter than the Optoma . - Better designed box , integrated lense `` cap '' that slides , easier to use adjustable legs , more friendly packaging\/manuel , carrying case . Basically you get the feeling that Epson put some thought into its product . Feels more name brand and consumer friendly . - Supposedly has ~ 1000 bulb hours more than the Optoma when in Eco mode -LRB- a touch less bright than normal mode -RRB- . - Has a speaker -LRB- I did n't use it -RRB- . - Definitely better for office or daytime use . - Blacks appear gray when compared to adjacent wall . - Compared to the Epson , has a larger `` screen size '' to `` distance from wall '' ratio -LRB- I think this is called `` throw '' -RRB- . Plenty big . In fact I had to `` zoom out '' as the screen actually felt too large for the distance I was from the screen . The projector was propped up on a table immediately behind my couch . Once adjusted it was fine . The large size could be great for the gamers out there though . Optoma HD66 : - Feels more `` made in China '' with less fancy stickers and design . - Not quite as bright as the Epson . - I have yet to try this one during full daylight , but guessing the Epson would be better here . But this is fine with me b\/c I figure if it 's bright outside , I should probably be there instead of inside . - Much better colors . - Throw ratio not as good as Epson , but more than adequate for my needs . - DLP really does have much better blacks . The `` black frame '' around the movies is a far cry from gray , and I have a feeling if I fool around with it , I can probably get it to almost disappear . - Better picture quality - this was apparent to me and all 4 of my non-professional projector testing friends , and more apparent the darker the room is . The Epson is great , but the Optoma is like `` Whoa - I would n't think I would be able to tell , but I can . '' - Harder -LRB- though still possible -RRB- to discern the `` pixels '' - feels more like film . - I was worried about the `` rainbow effect '' . My friends and I were all able to see RGB shadows if we shook our heads back and forth wildly , and maybe a flash of it once or twice during the movie when our eyes would flick across the screen . Not really a big deal , though I guess some people are more `` susceptible '' to seeing it than others . Both : - Easily found my computer and displayed the correct resolution automatically . - Amazing resolution . - Plenty of adjustments to mess with color and whatnot . I only fooled around with these for 5 minutes or so . You can easily make the colors warmer or cooler . - Have a small remote with plenty of functions . Batteries included . - Do NOT come with HDMI , DVI , VGA cables . However , each does come with cable that allows you plug the traditional DVD player -LRB- the yellow , red , white `` RCA ? '' -RRB- cables into the VGA port . Like I said in the end I am sticking with the Optoma HD66 . Since the reason to get a projector , for me , is to have a really great screen to watch movies on , I figured I should lean toward picture quality over features . If I watched TV for a lot of the day , the brightness and bulb life of the Epson may have swayed me in that direction . I hope this is helpful and saves you all some time . 	Projector

BOTH CARTONS WERE INTACT ; HOWEVER , I ASSUME IT WAS DROPPED VERY HARD FROM A CONSIDERABLE HIGHT ...

This is a tough review because this is the first projector that I have purchased . I was really blown away by the absolutely beautiful , breath-taking images that covered my ENTIRE Green wall , but I ended up having to return it for some of the following reasons . When it arrived , the seal looked broken , the monitor cord was missing and a rbg to monitor cord was in its place . The native resolution was 800 X 600 , on my computer , xbox and cable output . THERE WAS NO USB PORT ! Which means that you have to by the custom optima toggle for $ 123 if you want wireless . AND you will want wireless because , you have to set your projector in the center of the room , on a cart or heavy duty tripod . The sound is poor from the projector but I was able to plug in a speaker system into the headphones jack . Too many wires coming from my TV , wii , x-box , sound system , plug , cable , to the center of the living room with little kids running around for my comfort . If you do n't mind using a cord , you CAN reduce it by purchasing a multi-port HDMI switch for around $ 15 . The other problem that I had was the focus is really tight . There is no fine tuning and it is all manual . Beware that 3D ready does not really mean that it is 3D ready . That means you must have a computer with a strong enough graphics card that puts out 120 hertz . X-box and blu-ray 3d are not currently compatible until a new $ 400 part comes out that will have to be added on later this fall or sometime next year . Then , plan to pay extra for the 3d glasses , over $ 100 a pair , AND possibly a special 1.3 to 1.4 hdmi conversion cord , depending on which website you review . The last problem is that this is not very portable , although it comes with its own backpack , which is really hip for teen-gamers ! The projector itself is very flimsy made of cheap plastic , I would not trust it in the backpack from being crushed or banged around , and I sure would not trust a teenager with it . The lens cap is useless . It does not twist on and will not stay on . I would be worried about it slipping off and scratching the lens in a backpack or any type of traveling . The size of the GT700 is quite large , it fits in the entire backpack , although it is light due to the cheap plastic wrapper . I give it a three , because of the outstanding image , which would be a five ! But the flimsy , dollar store plastic wrapper , and bulky size would make this very non-portable to business travelers . For the build , I give it a one . If you are living in a really large home , with a huge wall , and can mount this from an extended projector rod where ceiling fans , or light fixtures wo n't get in the way , then this may be the right projector for you . This would make a good projector for a school or business if it sat on a portable cart , or on a board table . The light is quite bright and impressive in the daytime . 	Projector
We have 4 of these deployed in a bar environment switched on 12 + hours a day to show sports and other TV channels and we could n't be happier . They are exceptionally easy to install with a simple menu that makes it easy to invert the picture , adjust the keystone settings , and basically set up the projector so that the only button that needs to be pressed is ON\/OFF . Fortunately , there 's a remote so there 's no need to touch anything on the unit itself . In our case , the bulbs last 6-8 months each and are also easy to change . I tested one at home where we 're lucky enough to have a very , very large white wall and watched Avatar . Short of cooking up some popcorn , it was like sitting in a movie theater . It 's true that the projected image lacks the definition of an average high-def flat-screen , but the image size is significantly larger than anything you could reasonably buy as a TV . For watching movies and sports , what this unit is capable of producing is truly remarkable . While I 'm sure there are many better projectors in terms of picture quality , none comes close at this price point . I 'd highly recommend for anywhere you need a big screen . 	Projector
Just remember , u get what you pay for . It is a cmos , not ccd . Just wish u could take a picture and not video only . 	Projector
The projector is lightweight , easy to set up and works well with iPad , iPhone and iPod Touch with the only included cable . Surprisingly the speakers are good and there is an audio out port to connect external speakers . Here are some cons : 1 . It is only limited to Apple devices and computer with VGA output . So you can not connect Android phones , Kindle Fire etc. . 2 . It mirrors only iPad 2 and also needs VGA cable for that . 3 . Built in stand is flimsy and you need a tripod . 4 . Amazing that a three hundred bucks device does not include a 2 dollar bag to keep charger , cable , projector and a small tripod in one bag . 5 . The manual is incomplete , e.g. there is a micro USB port on the cable without any mention in the manual . I presume it is for charging . 6 . Relatively expensive . With these limitations , the device works well . 	Projector
I was finally able to get the projector working with my MacBook -LRB- running Lion -RRB- after the support team sent me the latest driver for the USB link . This process was quite frustrating yet I must say the fix worked the first time . Overall OK for customer service . Pros : - display is very bright - the ability to adjust color is important as well and intuitive . - menus are simple and intuitive . - Once customer support was actually engaged , it worked well . Cons : - I had a great deal of difficulty with initial installation with my MAC - despite the claims of ` it works right out of the box ' it did not . OS X Lion has been out for over a year - why are they shipping with an old driver ? - video playback for YouTube and DV files from my hard drive is choppy . The frame rate supported by the projector is far from ideal . I found it quite noticeable . When I looked at the computer screen the playback remains clear and chop-free . Not sure what the issues are here , but this is a definite detractor . I need to test with a DVD and see if this is true for that as well . I will update when that test is complete . Update on paying a DVD from my MacBook : The DVD screen was a mass of gray and white squares - no picture of the movie at all . I emailed customer support for assistance . - customer support got right back to me - which is great , but the the advice was to use the VGA cable to fix the issue I had . This shows a basic lack of understanding of my system . MacBook does not support VGA cables , so their advice was useless . - Customer support once again replied a couple of days later and advised me to purchase an adapter for the VGA cable to ensure that DVD playback on the MacBook would function properly . Once again , I find this a less than desirable solution . It 's not like MACs are ` strange ' - VGA is old technology , it 's time to update people ! I am reducing my review to three-stars based on this experience . Overall - for the price - a VERY solid projector for business applications . I can not recommend it at this point for entertainment applications as the video playback is simply not up to par . 	Projector
8\/16\/11 : I have now entered the 21st century with this alarm clock ! It has so many wonderful features ! First , the numbers are nice and large , so it 's easy for this Baby Boomer to read ! It also has a projection feature that projects the time on the ceiling ! So I do n't have to look at the clock to see what time it is , just take a look at the ceiling ! Second , it has an automatic time zone feature . In program mode , select the number that corresponds to your time zone and voila ! It automatically sets it for the time and date ! Third , it has two separate alarms . Depending on the type of wake-up call you want , you can set Alarm 1 for a gentle wake-up call -LRB- soothing sounds for example or easy listening -RRB- and Alarm 2 for those urgent , immediate wake-up calls on the days you have to get to work asap . And you have your choice of soothing sounds : birds chirping & chimes , ocean waves , etc. . You can program the alarm to set off 7 days a week , Mondays-Fridays only , or weekends only . That 's a great feature so you do n't get woken up to your favorite Heavy Metal station on the weekends ! It has a backup battery system that will still wake you up even if you have a power outage during the night . My favorite feature is the `` Sleep '' feature , in which you can set the clock to play soothing sounds for 60 - 99 minutes . This helps to put me and my little pre-school son to sleep . It shuts off after the alloted time . The instructions are easy to read and follow , although you do have to read them to figure out the features . 8\/19\/11 UPDATE : I 've been forced to lower my rating from 5 stars to 3 . I guess that 's why this clock is only $ 29.99 . After about 3 days , it started to do some wonky things . I was using the `` Sleep '' feature to play the soothing sounds mode and that has stopped working . When I press it , the display alternately flashes the time and a radio station . I keep having to play with it until I can at least get the soothing sounds to play . It has a very long , thin wire antenna which could easily break off , so that 's not so great . Alarm 1 seems not to work all the time . I keep referring to the instructions to reset the `` Sleep '' feature and Alarm 1 , and I do everything step by step , yet the `` Sleep '' feature does n't work and Alarm 1 is iffy . The instructions are not very good when you are trying to troubleshoot . Too bad , because the features are really nice on the clock ... if only they 'd keep working . 9\/2\/11 UPDATE : Radio no longer works . Soothing sounds does not work . Sleep mode does not work . I set Alarm 1 for 6:45 AM and it somehow switched on its own to 6:45 PM . Dropped rating to 1 star . I 've had the clock for almost a month , and it seems more of its features stop working . I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS CLOCK . The basic clock still keeps time , and the projection light works , but that 's about it . 9\/15\/11 UPDATE : Alarms do not work AT ALL . The only thing this clock does is keep time . The light that reflects the time on the ceiling still works , but all the other features do not . I have never have a product go bad so quickly . 9\/20\/11 : Clock is DEAD . Had to unplug it while cleaning . When I plugged it back in , nothing displayed . Never have I had a product that died so QUICKLY as this one . Save your money and buy another brand . Do n't buy this clock . Timex is known for watches , but not alarm clocks . Total disappointment . 	Projector
Found this product by lucky coincidence when shopping for screens . I was extremely wary of this purchase at first because its price tag was only a little more than a comparably sized pull-down screen , and significantly less than the nearest-priced automated screen . Turned out to be a beautiful , reliable product that I have enthusiastically recommended to others whenever I can . Favi has done an excellent job with attention to detail , even the control box has a removable mounting plate making it a cinch to install\/hang . If I was forced to balance this praise with some kind of complaint , I guess it would be the fact that the power cord is a fixed connection from the outlet to the control box and then to the screen , making it difficult to run through a wall . An extremely minor issue , though . The screen continues to impress myself and others who watch films on it . 	Projector

Ordered this projector after reading good reviews here and elsewhere . Initially I was quite impressed by the image quality , very decent 720P image that matched my expectaions . However , about 9 month into use , the projector started developing bad pixels . I made the obviouse mistake of not returning it on the spot for an in-warranty repair . Initially just a few ... but the situation deteriorated over time . I 'm now about 18 months from first use and the device is unusable ; there are over 100 bad pixels -LRB- mostly white -RRB- plus a `` bad '' black line running across at about 2\/3 the screen . Obviously there is something significantly wrong with the reliability of the DLP device used in this design ... I have contacted Customer support ... looking forward to their reply . Update May-31-12 : Have returned the unit to Optoma for repair - they gracefully accepted this as an `` in warranty repair '' even though technically out of the guaranteed 12-month period . Good expereince ... makes me comfortable of purchasing Optoma products in the future . 	Projector
I bought this projector from Walmart at the beginning of July . I used it for about a month , primarily playing Xbox and watching movies on it . I used a VGA cable to connect it to the Xbox and it was great for a while . It worked flawlessly for a low resolution projector . Randomly today , I tried to power it up and play a game and the light just turned off . I could switch to composite video and the light would turn back on . Thought when I tried to play Xbox on the composite setting , it would n't work . I called customer service ... Let 's just say do n't even bother with that . They are worthless . All in all , fun projector , but do n't expect much life out of it . 	Projector
This projector its awesome , works very good , it is really handy and i can bring it everywhere , really easy to use and very useful . it is a really worthy item at that price 	Projector
Hi everyone , Each year around this time , your old friend Sam gets into high tech gear and explores the latest gadgets out there . This year I wanted to add big screen video to our bedroom to take advantage of watching more of the many , many DVD 's I have amassed in the past few years . Why watch lousy TV programs when you can see a good feature and see it movie size ? Well , I had NO IDEA what a REVOLUTION has occurred in video processing technology at a price ANYONE can afford right now . Those of you who have seen my eight foot projected picture at home will appreciate what I am about to tell you ... you can have close to that great quality for DVD 's , Cable TV or High Definition , or other sources for only $ 999.99 and all you need do is go to Circuit City and buy the INFOCUS X1 projector . Infocus is one of the leading manufacturers of projectors for industrial use and their sets are now being tailored for home use . Their products use the DLP technology -LRB- Digital Light Producing -RRB- and the latest Texas Instruments chip . This baby is smaller than a typewriter -LRB- about 5 by 10 by 12 -RRB- and weighs only six pounds . The bulb will last for up to FOUR THOUSAND hours and is relatively cheap to replace . The brightness and contrast specs are actually better than my two year old six thousand dollar Sharp XV-9000 projector . It has lower resolution than some higher priced machines , but still enough punch to make any DVD look great for picture sizes up to nine feet . It even has a small speaker and amp built in so you do n't need to hook up a sound system , which is especially handy if you want to carry it out anywhere . It has a zoom lens that allows you to adjust picture size and a handy remote control that provides all the choices for any adjustments you need . Right out of the box , and without making any adjustments , the picture on `` Annie Get Your Gun '' -LRB- an exceptional DVD ! -RRB- looked beautiful . I hyped the brightness , color , and contrast a bit and was even more pleased . Truly , this projector is just unbelievable and it is a thrill to share this review of its great performance with you . You do n't even need a screen to enjoy the picture , as it will work on a white wall or even a sheet . A cheap screen will be better , however . Anyone with at least a five foot throw distance can enjoy this baby in a darkened room . I had mine about fifteen feet from the screen for an eight foot picture . Even with light on in the room , the picture can be enjoyed . This projector was introduced at $ 1,600.00 and was recently lowered in price because a newer model is coming out next year ... BUT the new model will not include the fine Faroudja processor that is built into the unit . This processor is great at cleaning up imperfections in video . Jagged edges , video noise , and more will be smoothed out . As usual , I did much research into this and compared other models and read countless reviews to find the best bang for the buck right now . There are a few other models that average a couple hundred more and will probably give similar performance , but I do n't think any other machine will come close for this price . So , if a big beautiful video experience is what you have been waiting for ... go get one and enjoy ! Just hook up your cable box or an inexpensive DVD player and you are in business . BOTTOM LINE : People who are going out and buying those huge rear projection TV 's that are heavy and take up a lot of room paid from two to three thousand dollars and sometimes much more . You can have a picture double their size , that will have no `` burn in '' problems , take up no space , and almost certainly will have a superior picture ... for a third of the price . The projector also has a THREE year warranty . I think Santa Claus came early this year ... because it feels like Xmas here today ! best to all , Sam 	Projector
Yes , it 's wonderfully small , lightweight , portable , and easy to operate . But what you get from this projector is an image that even in a dark room on a projector screen at a mere 30 '' diagonal has illegible words and colors that are a miserable reflection of what you 're trying to project . -LRB- Yes , I used the focus dial to try and sharpen the image . -RRB- If you 're projecting in black-and-white or do n't care about color , if you 're showing a presentation that has all 36-point font , or if you absolutely need to carry something in your pocket at all times in case you need to project an image , this is your baby . Otherwise I suggest getting creative , using something else , or skipping the visuals . My expectations may have been unrealistic . Make sure yours are not . 	Projector
So far this has been a good buy . I am Mark Tucker , the assistant pastor at Old Orchard Church in St. Louis , MO. . This DP was a great find because it does exactly what we need it too . We do n't need the extreme high definition images , but we want something that looks good and enlarges well . It does get a bit hot after 2 hours of straight use , but I am not sure that this is a problem . The price point was excellent for us as a small church , especially since I got it as an Open Box discount . I love the options and the keystone feature . 	Projector
I bought this model 4 years ago for my computer lab . From the very start I had troubles . The projected image flickered and jumped . I called right away and they replaced my lamp for free . For the next 2 years it worked sporadically . It would not come on the first time I turned it on , sometimes I had to unplug it . I called several times and was given the run around . Finally a notice to extend my warrenty came . I extended it and called again . I was told it was certainly because the lamp was getting near the end of it 's 1000-2000 hours -LRB- big difference , eh ? -RRB- . I explained there was no way it had been used for that many hours , and the tech support guy argued with me . I gave up arguing and tried one of the things he said -LRB- take out the lamp and remove the dust -RRB- . After that , it worked consistantly . -LRB- When I could finally get it to work , I checked the lamp hours ... it had run for 238 , no where near 1000 -RRB- . I thought I was home free . I used it today and it was on for about an hour plus . I was away from it working on a computer when I heard a loud bang . I looked up and the screen was blank . The darn lamp exploded ! I hate to give up on InFocus all together , but I may have to . 	Projector

I purchased this projector in Oct 2011 directly from Aaxa . I am a teacher working in two schools and I use this projector nearly every day . I connect my iPhone 4 and iPad 2 to it and also play video files from the internal drive or a flash drive , mostly successfully . The specs are the best in this category at the moment , and the design is good . There are a few details that other reviewers have not mentioned , however : \* The fan noise is more than noticeable . It 's actually a little annoying . \* The power button is situated such that the P4 can be switched on in a crowded bag pretty easily . \* The buttons are not very responsive . My feeling is that this is more of a system software issue than a purely hardware issue . Button clicks frequently get no response or a delayed response . I feel like the system software is not quite ready for prime-time . \* While it 's impressive that they included any sort of internal speaker , it 's only usable in a very quiet environment and then really only for speech . There 's really no point at all to listening to any sort of music track with it . If you plan on using headphones , then you 're fine , but if you need to run a cable to a pair of external speakers then you 're losing the cable-free benefit of a battery-powered device . If you do n't mind plugging it in for power then you might as well get a brighter pico projector . \* The P4 does NOT mount properly on any external computer , and I 've tried several Mac and Windows machines . The manual says very clearly that it should be able to do this . When connected via USB , it might mount for just a moment , but then it will immediately unmount or produce some kind of error message . I 've had absolutely no success transferring files directly from a computer to the P4 . When I contacted their support staff about this , I was told that I should put my files on a flash drive , and then move them from the flash drive to the P4 . This is very disappointing and inconvenient . -LRB- Are other users having this problem ? I 'd like to know . -RRB- \* Transferring files from a flash drive involves going into Windows CE , which requires the additional purchase of the little USB keyboard . The keyboard is pretty cool , but it 's somewhat expensive , and because it 's so small , it 's awkward to use . \* When copying files , I 've frequently had weird anomalies where the P4 seems to think there are two copies of the file , with slightly different directory paths , and it gives me error messages that it is unable to find the second file . Irritating ! \* Video playback always starts with the first video in your directory , requiring you to stop playback , go back to your directory listing , and select the file you want . \* Although the internal flash drive is 2 gigs , the operating system takes up a great deal of that , so there is n't more than a couple hundred megs onboard , and that 's not much room for decent-quality video . I have not tried using an SD card . \* The color reproduction , even on a flawless white wall in a dark room , is mediocre at best . There are a few settings to adjust the color , most of which are totally unusable . My expectations were not that high , but I would n't want yours to be , either . \* The P4 does n't sync as readily via VGA as you 'd expect . If your cable gets jerked out , you ca n't just plug it back in . You 'll probably have to manually re-sync it or possibly restart the P4 . \* The battery does not last more than 70 minutes . None of these issues are substantial enough for me to return the unit or recommend against buying it , but they might matter to you , depending on your planned use . The basic utility of the P4 is massive , although the shortcomings are constantly annoying . I look forward to future units from Aaxa , where we 'll hopefully get 120 + lumens -LRB- laser driven ? -RRB- from a longer-lasting battery , better and more adjustable color , and perhaps some kind of wireless a\/v streaming . But for now , this is a very handy and useful device . 	Projector
I used this to install a HC1500 Mit . Projector and I could n't be happier with the product . It is very heavy duty , and has many adjustments . I can not think of a way it could be better . 	Projector
For people who want the extra size view without the weight or price of the alternatives ... <p> Picture quality - XGA is beautiful ; most people should be very pleased . Daylight and other light sources outside of the projector do affect the viewability of the picture , but it is not extreme . Dark parts of movies or games may be harder to see during the day . Different settings - economic , presentation , vivid , video may improve the picture . During dark hours , no problems exist , even in economic mode . <p> My main reason for going this route for my home theater was to tie the unit in with my computer . I previously installed a tv tuner card and a DVD burner in my home-assembled computer . Since most projectors , including the Benq , have a vga input port -LRB- the 6200 even comes with the cable -RRB- , the connection could n't be simpler . I also use a 4-input switchbox to handle my VHS player , XBox and anything else that comes along -LRB- for example , a regular DVD player , a tv , my son 's Gamecube etc. -RRB- I set my computer to 1280x1024 which the Benq can handle , compressing it to 1024x768 . <p> Tips - <p> 1 -RRB- Placement If you own your home , you could work a ceiling mount . I used a very reasonably priced &eacute;tag&egrave;re . <p> 2 -RRB- Screen I ca n't comment on how good a white wall works , because mine is n't white . I made my own 4:3 ratio screen from 1x2 douglas fir and 2 yds of 54 '' wide blackout cloth -LRB- from a regular fabric store -RRB- . Many people on the internet offer advice on how to do it . Mine is quite light . I used two plastic anchors and extra long screws to hold the bottom edge of the top of the frame on the wall . Since many alternatives for a screen drive up the price of an economical `` luxury '' system , they were not for me . <p> 3 -RRB- Bulb -LRB- Lamp -RRB- With a lifespan of 2000-3000 hours and the price of a replacement currently running at $ 400 , I am picky about when I plan to use the projector tv - only for special events -LRB- when I get an HDTV tuner card for the computer , I might feel differently -RRB- ... Video games - often ... Movies - virtually every time ... Computer\/internet - occasionally When any of these sources are well done , one is interested on any size screen . <p> 4 -RRB- Sound The Benq only handles the video signal . I 'm using my computer sound card , which can handle 5.1 sound . With my quality 5.1 speakers , I 'm in home theater heaven . Which brings to my last item , where I could use a tip . <p> 5 -RRB- Wires With the Benq projector I have a power cord , a vga cable , an s-video cable , and a composite video cable . Add to that all the cables for the aforementioned items , and you have cable jungle - guaranteed not to please any woman that I know . I plan to handle part of it with throw rugs . As for the rest ... help ! <p> Lastly , I need to mention two things . First , Benq is coming out soon with a replacement for the 6200 with the latest DLP chip from Texas Instruments . Second , the 6200 keeps track of how many hours that it has been used , which you can monitor from its menu program . It will warn as the hours limit approaches and actually refuse to start at 3000 hours , until you replace the lamp . 	Projector
I did a lot of research and it boiled down to the PB6100\/6110 or the InFocus X1\/X1a . I purchased the PB6100 and have been plesantly surprised after a month of use . In presentation mode , the picture at 7 feet wide is sharp and impressive -LRB- make sure you select the correct user mode -RRB- . For movies , the picture quality is truly stunning -LRB- must choose cinema mode -RRB- at 7 feet wide !! It appears that the quality of DVD player is rather important as a budget DVD player produces a washed out screen while a good progressive scan player produces rich and vibrant colors with no distortion . Shockingly good , even with some ambient light . It is a huge payoff for a very modest investment . Very enthusiastically recommended . 	Projector
i just got my `` new '' projector today and the thing is already broken and i wanted to call customer serves but no one works on the weekends anymore . plus i have to pay to ship the broken projector back to lonestar . 	Projector
This product seemed to come with improper parts , the instructions\/separation of items was incredibly difficult to understand , and at the end of the day that piece worked so poorly that I through it out and just installed a shelf for my projector instead . Do n't buy it . 	Projector
I bought this projector 2 months ago and it has already broken on me ! Have maybe watched 10 movies on it tops and now it is not turning on . When I spoke to customer service about this issue they were totally helpless and insisted that I pay them $ 75 to send it in and have to inspect it . I find this totally insane since I have hardly used it and clearly this is a poorly made product . If you are considering getting a projector do NOT get this one . They have awful customer support and cheap products . 	Projector
We got it for a smaller business operation and it has a very crisp display . We use this in a fully lit room on a non-white screen , and it still projects an easily legible image from our computers . Extremely easy to set-up , use and makes little to no noise . Quick delivery from Amazon . 	Projector

I got my proyector in the mail anf right out of the box it had a problem with the audio , could n't fix the problem so a called amazon and they sent me a new one the next day -LRB- amazon costumer service was exelent -RRB- I recived the 2nd one and everything worked great for one hole day , i was very happy in till the hdmi port stared to act funny , the hdmi will lose complete signal , this was very anoying because everytime i had to desconect my ps3 or blue ray and hook it right back to get the signal going again !! I HAD 2 FOR A WEEK AND ONLY WAS ABLE TO USE IT ONE DAY FOR ABOUT 2 HOURS ... . WHAT A PAIN IN THE BUTT !! . . my son is upset because the thing does not work for hes ps3 and it made my experiance on getting this product soo miserable , I WILL NOT RECOMEND THIS UNIT IF YOU ARE PLANING ON USING IT WITH HDMI PORTS !! IM RETURNING IT AND GETTING MY MONEY BACK !! 	Projector
I do n't think I can say enough about this product . For an installation , it is perfect . The unit does have a thin skin -LRB- been struck by Wii remotes and no issues so far -RRB- . and is bulky for travel ; if you intend to use it in an installation it is great . I mounted my from the ceiling and the throw is perfectly suited for this . My price was 644 and this is a steal deal for that . It is bright , able to use it in a room that gets muted sunlight -LRB- closed white curtains -RRB- AND unshielded -LRB- naked -RRB- lights -LRB- 3 of them about 75 watts each -RRB- . Only in dark scenes do I see shadows on the screen from walls and such behind the projector . This is my everyday TV screen . I have it connected to Dish HD -LRB- 1080i -RRB- and with it projecting to a width of 9 feet you will be awed . Watching football will never be the same . I have used the speaker and while it is weak against my 1000 watt THX amplifier , it is perfectly suitable to hear in a reasonably quiet room . Pros : Bright , short throw , simple setup , 1080p , good value . Cons : No horizontal keystone , large , appears fragile , no DVI input . 	Projector
I purchased this EPSON Projector for the same reason a lot of people probably due . 1 . It is an EPSON . They make great products . 2 . The Amazon.com price is much lower than retail . 3 . The description promises a HUGE picture with a nice image . 4 . HDMI input and the promise of `` near HD '' quality picture . Well . Yes , it does look nice and it has a self-contained DVD player . The hook-ups are easy to reach and the remote glows in the dark . However : The ability to change settings lacks completely . It is like a robot : `` I must DO it THIS way . '' The lamp gets HOT ! VERY HOT ! So hot , that the exhaust makes it nearly impossible to adjust the front legs . Well , do n't even worry about doing that , because then you have white screen filled with no picuture . The Keystone adjustments work for the picture itself , but not the entire projected light image . The screensaver is something from the original Atari and the speakers sound muffled ; they are such bad quality speakers that , in order to hear the words , you have to turn it up to the point where your ears hurt from the loudness of everything else . Only the ECO setting lets the fan noise decrease enough to even hear the speakers . This is a piece of garbage projector . Unless , you really wanna watch all of your television and movies in stunning 480i picture quality -LRB- like an old VHS Tape -RRB- but REALLY REALLY BIG !!!!! - Then this is for you . Otherwise , save your money and buy a 32 '' or 37 '' LCD 720 or 1080 TV . Heck , for $ 499.00 , you can probably get a decent 32 '' Class Full HD 1080p television or 37 '' Class 720p HD television . Do n't waste your money on this projector . If , the 720p or 1080 HD ones ever come down to a decent price ; I will consider buying another one . Until then , I 'll stick with the flat screen .

Installing the feet onto my Vivitek 1080FD was a puzzle . Took me 4 or 5 attempts to get something that would project and swivel the correct direction . There are a lot of tweaks you can make to swivel the projector over different axes once it 's initially installed . Due to the unanticipated flexibility of the mount , I was able to get an extra 10 '' of screen space due to being able to work around my ceiling fan and overall room conditions . One complaint I do have is there 's only an anchor kit for concrete , but not for drywall . I guess they expect you to find a stud , but in my location I was unable to use the stud and still have the picture centered . I just picked up an anchor kit from Home Depot and from there installation went smoothly . 	Projector
When I ordered this item I was optimistic considering that it is half the price of an OEM replacement . Given that this is my third lamp in the 5 + years I have owned the TV I was looking for a cost savings . When I opened the package I noticed that the glass in front of the bulb does not cover the whole opening , it is a vertical rectangle rather a full circle like the toshiba factory replacement . This replacement unit lacks the Toshiba markings . Other than these few differences I have not seen any issues . The unit plugged in as normal and my TV has been operating fine with normal viewing habits . 	Projector
I 'm very happy with this purchase . This works great for watching movies ! I used a new white sheet and hung it on the wall with thumb tacks . For the price this projector delivers a nice 60 '' picture . I would highly recommend this product and seller ! 	Projector
Save your money and get a better projector . Even for kids you could get a cheap Chinese model from ebay for about the same price that is much brighter . 	Projector
I bought this on Amazon and had my parents deliver it to me in the Philippines -LRB- this saved me almost 50 % ! -RRB- . I 'm using this projector for home entertainment . I have it setup in my living room\/kitchen . This room gets lots of light as we are on the 16th floor . I have the bulb set to eco mode , as I want to extend the life . The image is visible on my wall , but not very enjoyable to watch . When we close all the curtains it looks great . I find the image quality to be good enough , even projected straight on my white wall . I do n't have any HDMI stuff , so do n't mind that it ca n't handle HDMI input -LRB- this could become a problem in the future I suppose -RRB- . I have 2 negatives for this projector so far . 1 . It does n't seem to auto-detect the input . So switching from computer to DVD player requires your pushing `` Source '' . Not a problem , just a bit annoying . 2 . Within the 1st month of use the picture went dark and the power light turned purple ! I freaked out a bit , flipped through the user manual -LRB- which is crap , like most user manuals -RRB- to find no helpful advise except to bring it in for servicing ! I left it alone for a good hour or 2 , but purple light kept flashing ! So I decided to unplug it and plug it back in ... and it worked ! Has n't happened again since . I had been using it for a few hours which may have cause it to overheat ? I 've also changed it 's location which is a bit more open and should help with ventilation . I recommend this projector for most average users . You 'll enjoy it and it 's large picture . We still watch cable on our small TV in our bedroom , but all movies get viewed on the projector . If you 're thinking of getting one of the new LED projectors because of the how long the bulb will last , consider your average viewing time . I calculated ours and this bulb should last about 4-5 years ! That 's pretty decent . 	Projector
As amazing as this sounds I assure you its true . I set the resolution on my pc as 1280x720 , the Projector seems to automatically scale that down to its own native resolution . It looks almost identical to the Screens I see in my local Cinema . The difference is it can not do more than 144 inch well it can but it starts to get a little blurry after that . It shows AMAZING at 100 INCH !!!! Somehow no matter how big you make the screen the quality still remains amazing . The brightness is very good also . Now I am speaking of the dark . If you want to view it with lights on you are gonna have to move it close to do about 23 inch screen . That is if you want a very bright screen . It can do a extremely bright 23 inch screen . But for 42 inch etc be prepared to wait till night time . However at nights it shows marvelous even at 100 inch . I still can not get over the quality , this thing looks just like my friend 's 720p HD projector when playing movies only that his one is much brighter . But I prefer a dimmer projector with a bulb you never have to replace over the brighter ones that requires a new bulb every year . And thats the beauty of this one . You get 20,000 hours . The maximum screen size I have been able to get from it that is viewable was about 150 inch . I waited till night and shined it on my neighbor 's house . It was literally as big as a cinema screen . However the image was a little bit blurry at 150 inch . I think 150 is the absolute limit anything bigger than that will require more brightness and an overall better lens and resolution etc. . However it should be noted 150 inch IS MASSIVE !!!!!!!!!! Jesus its as tall as me . Larger than life . In closing just buy this thing and you will see for yourself . It can definitely compete with a 42 inch HDTV when playing movies . Its very colorful etc this thing is amazing . Anyone who rates this less than 5 stars who does not have a defective product is a total douche bag . Because the bottom line is this thing is $ 179 . If you was expecting a 1080p world class Projector that can do 400 inch then I am sorry to disappoint you but you are going to be disappointed . Go and spend $ 15,000 on a Sony Projector you will get the best . Only Negative apart from needing pure darkness and pure white wall for cinema experience which is expected of any projector anyways , anyways besides that only negative is you need to move the projector far far back to get big pictures . It has no manual zoom . So at 10 feet you will get about 72 inches . However you will not want to go back after you seen it at 100 inch . 	Projector
I love the screen . Easy to set up . Arrived early . Packaging was great . -LRB- seemed almost overdone -RRB- All the mechanisms work . The screen is flawless and easy to clean . Why the four stars , you might ask ? When I opened the box , I was surprised at how well it was packaged . No way , this was going to be damaged while being shipped . However , there were two spots on the metal that were bent . I do n't know how it would have happened , because there were no scrapes on it . Just two bends . This in no way affected the screen or the use of the screen assembly . It does what it is supposed to and looks great ! Deserves five stars for the quality , but thought everyone needed to know about the bends . 	Projector
The projector is good enough for a kids toy or use but not what you would want if you are looking for decent quality 	Projector
I purchased this projector in August of 2011 and enjoyed using it to project on my ceiling at night , and when the power went out in all of southern california last summer , me and my roommate were able to watch netflix on this baby . Just recently in February or so it stopped projecting all three colors so the hue was a very red color and no adjustment would change it , and then it would power off after 45 seconds or so . I contacted the company who got back to me within 24 hours and had me RMA the unit back to them . They let me email them my tracking number and immediately sent out a brand new unit . They even let me keep all the accessories including the battery of the original unit . I got the new projector within 4 or 5 days of the initial RMA request . This company REALLY stands behind their product , and for that I am extremely impressed . The projector unit itself has a pretty decent picture for such a small device . My battery life is somewhere from 35-40 minutes on the brightest setting , but i can easily plug it in while projecting to watch as long as i 'd like . The one caveat is that it must be almost completely dark in the room for a larger picture . But once it 's dark , i can project an entire wall with the image with pretty dang fine clarity .

I had a Mitsubishi HC1500 projector in a somewhat light controlled room for the last 3 years . It finally got hit my a South Alabama lightning strike and fried the circuit board . I paid about $ 600 for the Mitsubishi refurbished but almost new and thought that $ 600 now would get me at least as good a projector three years later . Wrong . The Optoma was noisy and the image not nearly as sharp as the Mitsubishi it replaced . The deal breaker , however , was the fact that the Optoma could not hold the signal coming from my Blu Ray player 25 ' away . The Mitsubishi had no trouble locking on the signal . The Optoma would display the image , then flash the screen white for a second then lock onto the signal again , then loose it once more . I guess that if you just wanted to game with this projector then it would be fine . I returned it promptly to Amazon for a trouble free refund . -LRB- thanks Amazon -RRB- . I am now looking for a different projector . No more Optomas for me . 	Projector
It is easy to use , small , compact and low weight , the clarity of pictures , pircture quality is nice , it works very good with daylight and even better with no light , I have n't tested the function of 3D because I do n't have video card but I supuosse that it 's good too 	Projector
This is a small but powerful hand-size projector . I use it for my English class in the Ecuadorian campo . The focus is very precise but easily disturbed . I would like to have it set up so that the image can be either vertical or horizontal . The power cord is the same as on my HP laptop -LRB- except the device end -RRB- and is heavy enough to drag the projector off the table and on to the floor . LED bulb replacement ? UNKNOWN . Despite my apparent negative comments , I really like this little gem and would recommend it to anyone who can accept its limitations . Oh , and the price-is-right . 	Projector
Certainly for the price this a well made budget product and capable of pushing a decent image on an unprepped wall with gOod clarity , easy adjustment and solid construction . It is not mind blowing and the audio leaves something to be desired , but my God ... for the price ? Unbelievable . 	Projector
Yamaha is a great company when it comes to sound . I have 2 very fussy music teachers in our family , my son and wife . Surround sound with many boxes may be overkill . I think it is false to have something go bump on one side and instead of the sound being beside the screen ... it is unrealistically beside your arm . The Yamaha has a method of studying your room for reflective surfaces , and you actually must leave the room for it to do so . I have the subwoofer behind the TV with the omni-directional bass sounds . We are happy and that is incredible for these sharp musicians . Look no further ... lots of boxes is just awkward , false impressions and a mess to place them . This is light , thin and blends with the TV styling and coloring . No need to improve this model in the near future , either . 	Projector
This is a very good projector mount . I had a very difficult install ahead of me -LRB- low basement ceiling , with a support beam blocking my projector view on the ceiling -LRB- I had to mount the project behind the beam to get my 106 '' image -RRB- . Needless to say , this was not going to be an easy install to get the image lined up without the beam interfering -LRB- and I have a DLP projector with not many placement options and limited zoom -RRB- . Long story short , this mount worked . I would have liked the three twist screws that connect the projector to the mount to be more flexible without having the projector come loose -LRB- which it did a few times -RRB- . Making the ever so fine adjustments was a bit difficult since I could not get a screwdriver in there being only a few inches below the ceiling . I eventually used a drill bit and vice grip to do the job . Again , this was about a difficult install as you could probably do and this mount did the job . In most people 's installs , you can adjust the arms alone and achieve great results ... I had to use everything I could do to get this to seat perfectly . I highly recommend the mount and I would be surprised if this could n't meet your installation needs . Fit and finish is excellent and the mount wo n't budge once properly tightened -LRB- which is good because I do not look forward to adjusting my projector anytime soon -RRB- . 	Projector
I was in the market for a cheap projector to use for movies until I have the money for something worth spending a lot of money on . I started off buying the Discovery Wonderwall projector for $ 70 and then promptly returned it as the image quality was very poor -LRB- I could not read subtitles -RRB- and it was not bright enough to project a dark scene -LRB- e.g. the cave seen in Lord of the Rings -RRB- even in a totally dark room . I then got the PT100 and feel that it works very well for being under $ 200 . It is a clear enough image that the subtitles in a movie are easy to read . However , when hooked up to a PC the words on the desktop icons are not clear enough to easily read . It is bright enough that about 90 % of the detail can be seen during dark scenes -LRB- e.g. the cave seen in Lord of the Rings -RRB- . It does need to be used in a dark room to have any quality . I would say the image quality is similar to VCR\/analog TV with the benefit of a small , lightweight package that is versatile and can project a large screen size . 	Projector
Dont be fooled by the low price of this projector . I have a movie room i just built and got everything but a projector i researched many and for the quality i wanted i was looking at 2000 dollars . I found this and was amazed when hooking it up to my xbox 360 in HD and my Comcast HD cable box . Watching the red sox game is a blast at 150 inches . Even at that big the quality is better than a 6000 dollar plasma . If you are building a entertainment room it is perfect . 	Projector

Product was very affordable & is a superb choice for the price . The image is a bit pixelated , but it is an excellent medium for playing games & watching movies .

Even though the Epson Movie Mate is an older version , it fits into my needs perfectly . I had no problems with the seller . E-Bay and Amazon.com are a great service . 	Projector
I am quite impressed with this projector , I need one that will project a fairly decent image in dim -LRB- but not dark -RRB- room and this one works well . I have watched some TV on it and a few movies . In a fairly quiet room the built in speakers will actually suffice . The picture is fairly decent for the money and certainly quite watchable . It accepts a HDMI input , though output appears to be SD quality rather than HD . The unit looks well made and comes with most of the required cable , the HDMI is not included but can be found on amazon.com for a few bucks . For the price it really is a bargain and pleasing to watch , easy to set up and though the fan is noticeable , it is not bothersome to me . It does seem to get a little on the hot side but not excessively so and is not a concern at all . It has quite a few adjustments that can be made including sports\/cinema mode etc. . The remote control is very handy and makes most adjustments , be careful not to lose it . I bought a low end 60 '' X 60 '' proctor screen and this greatly improves the quality of the image . Though a white wall works , the white projector screen makes quite a difference if you can afford another $ 40.00 go for it ! I really ca n't knock this projector , it 's not high end and it does not pretend to be , it gives you a lot for your money and seems to be well made . An economical way to watch a movie on a wall -LRB- the whiter the better or a screen -RRB- without spending a lot of money ! 	Projector
One of the main features of the Epson EX31 , EX51 and EX71 is USB plug-n-play . This is theoretically a nice feature that simplifies setup . You just connect a single USB cable from PC to projector , and it sends all audio and video over that . Unfortunately Epson does n't have 64-bit USB drivers for Windows Vista or Windows 7 . This is despite the fact that about 50 % of Windows 7 installations are 64-bit . This indicates poor planning and lack of commitment to the most common operating system platform . This may change in time , but as of now -LRB- October 2010 -RRB- , Epson technical support says the company has no public plans for 64 bit Windows support of this feature . Therefore if you now have or plan on ever running any 64-bit version of Windows , just assume the Epson USB plug-n-play feature is n't there . Any evaluation of these Epson printers vs competitors should be minus this feature , as there 's no current public plan to ever support 64 bit Windows . Besides this , the projector works pretty well . It has multiple inputs : composite , S-Video , VGA and HDMI . Image quality on HDMI seems very good and it 's decent even on composite . The menu system is logical and easy to understand . However the fan is fairly loud , and there 's a soft repetitive beeping from the printer . The acoustic noise is probably OK in a noisy classroom , but it 's way too loud for a quiet environment . Also the on-board speaker volume is limited , so if your presentation contains audio , you 'll need external audio for people to hear it very well . 	Projector
This quit working after just a few minutes . We contacted the company which manufactured it , and never got an answer . It went back the next day . 	Projector
Had this projector for about a year now , so I 've had plenty of time to mess around with it . The picture quality is subpar when compared to most modern tvs and the refresh rate seems pretty low . I still prefer to watch movies on my other tvs and only really use this to play PS3 and Wii games on . Even with the less than ideal picture , it 's a great value and well worth the price . My son and I enjoy playing games on it especially since we play alot of split screen games and even with the screen split we can still easily see our sections of the screen due to our overall screen size being around 100 inches . As others have said , the fan in this unit is REALLY loud . I 'm wondering if you can replace it with something else , since it appears to be the same size\/type as the fans you would find in a computer . Also , the lack of a zoom function means you need to move the unit closer\/further away from your screen to change the size . This limits your mounting\/install options . 	Projector
Other negative reviews might possibly be from people who bought a former model , I do n't know . All , I can tell you is that this thing is completely awesome . Our projector at work failed and I used this and everyone in the room flipped out . We were not in total darkness , and the picture -LRB- ESPECIALLY TEXT -RRB- was super crisp . In total darkness , it 's obviously even better , beyond words . At home , hooked up with a very hard to find HDMI to Mini HDMI cable from a DVD or BlueRay player yields an absolutely phenomenal and huge picture . Everyone I show this to has a jaw-dropping response . 	Projector
WOW ! We got this as a gift for my husband who has wanted to have a ` Home Theater System ' . We are very pleased with it . The brightness is amazing . So fun to watch the really big screen ! The only thing that is so-so with it , is the smaller words are not as crisply clean as the rest of the picture . I 'm not persuaded that it 's not the fault of the DVD 's or VHS 's we have , but on the credits , the words are slightly fuzzy . However , I consider this by far one of the best purchases I 've made in a long while ! Awesome surprise for the family ! 	Projector
I bought this screen to host a Super Bowl party because it will be projected in the living room with plenty of ambient light . Watching sports and movies on my existing taupe colored wall was fine at night but washed out in the day . I got this screen because of the 1.3 gain rating . After some research , I discounted the smell comment -LRB- only 1 -RRB- , discounted the poor delivery rating -LRB- again only 1 -RRB- , discounted the edge problem -LRB- minor and unavoidable for size of rollable screen -RRB- and pulled the trigger . The screen was delivered with a `` silver '' service from the seller , nice touch . They brought it into the house and offered to unwrap it but after inspecting that the packaging was undamaged , I elected to unwrap it myself . The screen was well insulated with 2 layers of foam and the box edges were reinforced . Mounting the screen is a challenge by it 's sheer size , 12 feet wide and the precision required to get the screws into the exact location but that is not a design problem . It 's not any different from mounting blinds or window coverings , really . Performance wise , I am completely satisfied . One corner has the slightest tension deformity that I expect to lessen with time as I leave the screen suspended for a period of time . The curled edges are present on both sides but marginally so and really only is on the black border part and not on the white viewable surface . The motor is really quiet and it took less than a minute to deploy the screen 79 inches . Nighttime viewing was fine , the 1.3 gain is not as good as the 1.6 gain I had on a previous screen but will definitely allow me to have a great Super Bowl party . There is a slight chemical \/ paint odor if you stand within 4 inches of the screen and purposefully sniff it , but it really is a non issue unless you are extremely sensitive and have poor ventilation .

Very sturdy and solid construction . Mounting to a Dell 2400 projector was a little bit tricky because the projector only had one hole and I think this mount is for three holes . Anyway , I figured it out and now it just sits there holding up the projector . The wall mounting screws were a bit long - I used some shorter ones that worked better . I 'm happy with this product and would buy it again . 	Projector
I have used many projectors in my career but never used an InFocus Projector . When I bought it I liked the price and decided to give it a try . The projector was sent to me in a very timely fashion . It is used but in great shape and very easy to use . All in all this has been a good experience 	Projector
I do n't know if the problem is with the accessory kit or my projector , but I still have problems getting my Iphone 4 to work with my Optoma projector . 	Projector
After borrowing a friends Sony VPLCX6 projector with 2000 lumens and watching American Idol and `` I Robot '' on my great room wall I was hooked . An exhaustive 2 month online , in-store and Pawn Shop search ensued . I had 3 criteria to meet , under $ 1000 , atleast 1200 lumens and minimum 800x600 native resolution . After searching every electronic outlet in the greater Peoria area my Father in law pointed me to Sams Club . The only projector they carried was the Epson Powerlite S1 + and @ $ 699 with 1400 lumens this was the culmination of my search . I am projecting an image 8 ' x 6 ' onto a 1.3 gain theater screen . With the s-video connection the picture is fantastic . Most broadcast cable is quite clear , satellite channels are better and DVD is awesome . Screendoor effect is present as the image is quite large but easy to ignore and lose it as the images are very crisp . Only if I were rich beyond rich would I go with a higher end projector !

I ordered this item and it is one of the best investments I have ever made it works great good picture and kind of small and light weight . Also it seems durable the remote works well and it gets far range . I Love it so far . 	Projector
We have owned an Optoma 1080p for two years before purchasing the W6000 . We project on a gray wall with a screen size larger than 120 inches , ceiling mount . We use it for watching movies and playing PS3 games . The BenQ blows the Optoma away with crisp brightness yet no rainbows or loss of blacks -LRB- gotta love dlp -RRB- . Also virtually no aliasing . There is considerable set-up time if you are really picky about colors and contrast - but at least you have the choice . The fan noise was unnoticeable especially compared to the Optoma ... I was afraid it was n't working correctly at first . Much cooler , much quieter , better picture = worth the price . Additional note : We have become a house divided ... I like the Benq handling of motion , but my 28 year old son does not . We both agree that it is crisper , brighter and quieter than the Optoma but we are going to begin looking for a different projector that we both can love . Resolved ! The motion problems were a result of a setting on the PS3 . For games the motion was normal but for movies it was strange ... not blurry , but odd . We changed a setting on the PS3 from 24 frames to 60 Hz -LRB- ? -RRB- and now everyone agrees that this projector is perfect . 	Projector
I love the size but , picture quality is lacking and I bought mine so my wife could use it at school in a room with the lights off . I guess there is still too much light because it is impossible to see . I should have saved my money . Great concept just not bright enough 	Projector
Bought this thinking that the remote controlled PowerPoint slide shows . The projector arrived before the estimated delivery date -- which is when I realized it did not have that feature . If you do n't need that feature -LRB- I 'll accept blame for not researching it better ! -RRB- , this seems to be a pretty well made -LRB- albeit basic -RRB- projector . I called their customer service for info -- the person I talked to was very helpful and knowlegable . I was impressed . I returned the unit and purchased a different one , again , on Amazon .

This projector is great for portability . It is small -- surprisingly small ! If you need something small , portable , and with a decent resolution picture , this is a projector to get . However , you need to know the pros and cons with this one if you are looking for the all purpose projector . Pros : - Decent resolution , even with the odd 858x600 . - Small . I mean this thing is tiny ! - Handles videos well . - Great menu options . Acer does a great job with their UI . - Bulb will hypothetically last for 30,000 hours . Now that 's awesome . Cons : - It is not very bright , even only 9-feet from my wall . Do n't let the 200 lumens fool you . Even in a dark room it is not sufficiently bright . For me this was a deal breaker . - Fan can be a bit noisy , but not nosier than a laptop fan on high . This did n't bother us in the least . But if you 're sensitive to fan noise , then you may not like this projector . - Resolution is not my favorite . Even though I knew this going in , after seeing the actual picture I was n't impressed . Overall : Although this projector is not a bad buy , especially for its great portability , if you are looking for a bright picture that does n't need to be projected in a very dark room and can even be enjoyed in dim lights or with ambient sunlight , I 'd look elsewhere . This projector needs a very dark room to be remotely enjoyable . And any light will begin to wash out the picture , and I mean any ! After purchasing this projector , and after trying the Optomo PT105 -LRB- which I very much do not recommend -RRB- , I purchased the Acer X1261P . So far this projector meets all my needs : sharp picture -LRB- 1024x768 resolution -RRB- , bright image -LRB- 2700 lumens -RRB- , portability -LRB- even comes with a carrying case -RRB- , can project an image at 120hz , and is only $ 50 more than this projector . The two caveats to the X1261P is that the bulb will only last around 6,000 hours on eco mode -LRB- which is good overall for a standard bulb projector but not compared to the K11 's 30,000 hours -RRB- and it does n't have an HDMI input -LRB- although I bought an inexpensive HDMI to VGA converter here on Amazon to address this issue -RRB- . So for me , this was a better alternative to the K11 . Nevertheless , if my cons are not an issue , then you maybe happy with the K11 . 	Projector
These so called portable projectors are all craps . Do n't expect to watch movies or anything . I think this stuffs should be $ 100 . It 's simply a toy that makes you frustrate after 3 months . If it 's $ 100 , I will pay otherwise it 's not worth the money . However , if you want expensive toy go ahead buy , or if you have money to waste . But , I would bet you will feel the same . It 's worth $ 100 ! 	Projector
We have reviewed the Optoma PK-201 pico projector on Picopros . It has virtually all the connectivity you would need and produces a sharp , bright image . See the full review as well as many others here : -LRB- ... -RRB- Paul Picopros.com 	Projector
Bought this packet of items because of the Amazon recommendations `` people who bought this -LRB- productX -RRB- bought -LRB- productY -RRB- . '' However , it still sits in a box and has n't been opened . I am probably going to return it or gift it . I just do n't see a need for it and think it was a bad recommendation on Amazon 's part .

This projector worked fine for two months and seemed like a great buy . Then it stopped working . It will work from ten to thirty minutes and then the screen goes black . Since it lasted more than 30 days , I ca n't return it for a refund . The sellers do not respond to email . Theoretically it has a one-year warranty , but what good is that ? The manufacturer is in China ! The seller is in Texas but does not respond . Another thing : once you buy this thing , where are you going to get replacement bulbs for the projector ? You do n't see them on sale at Amazon , do you ? Consider buying a used projector , that originally had a MUCH higher price , on eBay . That 's what I 'll do now . But watch out for the high price of replacement bulbs in that situation , too . 	Projector
OK , this is NOT a projector for an office , a classroom , and definitely not for a die-hard videophile for their home theater . The `` PT '' in the PT100 stands for playtime , remember that . But , for shear fun , you ca n't beat the bang for your $ $ $ fun factor you get from this projector ! I have it set up in my basement projecting onto an 80 '' projector screen with it connected to an old surround sound system for a very inexpensive but awesome movie theater-like experience ! It easily connected to my Wii -LRB- pretty much designed for a Wii since it 's not HD -RRB- with the one yellow composite video cable to my Wii and the two audio cables going to my receiver . The movies I stream through Netflix look really good and the surround sound makes it all the better for the full theater experience . With all the lights turned off , it looks awesome ! -LRB- lights , even small ones , quickly degrade and washout the picture -RRB- . WARNING : Do not bother using the projector 's internal speaker since it is horrible . Also , forget about using this in a room with windows , sunlight will make the picture impossible to see . For these reasons , DO NOT BUY THIS PROJECTOR IF YOU DO NOT PLAN ON USING IT FOR GAMES OR MOVIES IN A VERY DARK ROOM WITH EXTERNAL SPEAKERS ! If I had planned to use this in a room with any ambient light and without surround sound or for actually wanting to be able to read fine print such as using it for a computer monitor , I would have been totally unhappy . Overall , buy this for family fun in your basement . This is not a replacement for your TV in your family room but it 's well worth the money if used within its limitations . Update : After 9 months half the pixels died . The lamp may last but the LCD display dies and you end up with a doorstop instead of a projector . 	Projector
I bought this projector in September , so far i havent got any problem with it , if i need to tell any bad points that would be that Aaxa dont make them with more that 110 lumens output . 	Projector
I was very excited about this item for two reasons , its portability , and the fact that the bulb would last a very long time so I would n't have to worry about replacing it as I travel internationally . Unfortunately the projector started malfunctioning right off the bat . Within three months I had to replace the cord , it cost sixty two dollars . After I received the cord , within a month the new cord does n't work correctly . I do n't think there 's anything wrong with the cord , it appears that at the junction point of the cord going into the projector is a malfunction in the design , as it does not want to sit straight for very long , causing it to not connect correctly , which causes the projection to cease in midstream . Ca n't watch things very long before this happens . Also , within six months the pixels I think , the screen started showing one white dot , then after another month it was three , and after a year it 's like sixteen white dots on the screen from the lens coat falling apart or something . Bottom line , within one year this thing is a piece of junk , and at four hundred dollars , it s a big disappointment . 	Projector
I finally got around to remodeling the bedroom and did a little over and beyond the `` honey do list '' . Since we were remodeling , my wife finally agreed to a TV in the bedroom but did n't want any wires , amps , speakers , ect . in the room to clutter up the new clean look . So I hung a flat panel with this Yamaha YSP-1100 under it . -LRB- I highly recommend the wall bracket for an application like this -RRB- . The sub is hidden in an undisclosed location and yes I hid the wires . Step 1 completed . Step 2 required me to make it work and make it easy . The auto-calibration feature was a snap . My bedroom is rectangular and the YSP-1100 sounds amazing ! There 's sound coming from all around the room but look honey , `` no speakers '' . I programmed it 's `` My Beam '' feature and so when one of us nod off , the other can still watch TV and not get the `` can you turn it down '' line . Well it passed inspection from the Executive Director of the Interior aka the Mrs ! Bottom line , it sounds amazing , looks cool and I highly recommend it . In fact , now my condo-livin ' brother-in-law wants one and yep , it 's been added to his `` honey do list '' . 	Projector
The product works and is easy to mount but company sent me used item when I purchased new one . There were scratches all over the mount . One star given because of ethical concerns not because of product functionality . 	Projector
I returned this projector , mostly because the picture was pretty bad with standard def . sources . Nintendo Wii looked pretty bad , and standard def . TV and DVD looked considerably less sharp than on my standard def . projector . Other problems : It ships with horrible looking color , the presets from the manuf . are terrible looking . After tweaking , you can get an ok looking picture but at that point the brightness is greatly reduced so I do n't consider this to be a particularly bright projector . Black level is not great either . I never tried it with high def . sources because the standard def . performance was a deal breaker for me . I replaced it with a much cheaper projector , the NEC NP115 and I 'm much happier with that one . Standard def . looks great , and the reviews say that high def . looks even better -LRB- I have n't tried a high def . source yet though -RRB- . The NEC 's presets look great , the high brightness settings retain decent color so they 're useful , and black level and shadow detail appear to be at least as good as on the HD66 . If you view a fair amount of standard def . content , I do not recommend the HD66 . 	Projector
I purchased this projector to use for business presentations when we are on the road . It packs nicely and is easy to travel with . It works well for the presentations and gets the job done . I am pleased with this purchase . 	Projector
I added this as a second projector in our church basement . Note that there is no way to adjust the picture size other than to move the projector itself . It does work like advertised , and has a good picture , -LRB- you may need to darken the room if you are going to use it in the daytime -RRB- and even has built-in speakers . I tried it first , and then opted to run plain 50 foot stereo cable with RCA type plugs , not video cable , and the picture is still very good . The direction booklet that came with it is 99 % useless . -LRB- Example : When use the remoter . -RRB- The shipper could not locate my house , even though we have had hundreds , if not thousands of deliveries using the same address . The seller found out what the holdup was on the delivery , and was very helpful . All in all , I would buy another one or recommend this to anyone else - with the notes above . 	Projector
I purchased this mount after reading the reviews for using this mount with an Epson 8350 . I took the advice of others in order to locate the balance point of the mount . Also , like others , I was only able to use 3 of the 5 mounting holes . However , I was able to mount the projector and it works very well . It took a little adjusting to get it level and solid but I was able to do it . I do want to use all 5 mounts as I want to be sure the projector is securely held . I found the Atdec website and sent a message to customer service asking how I would go about purchasing two additional long extensions . I was very pleasantly surprised when the customer service representative replied that he would send them to me no charge if I would provide my address . Now that is outstanding customer service !!!! Highly recommend this mount ! 	Projector
I loved this alarm . The wake up was soft and gentle . I used the attached flash light a couple of times when the electricity failed . Then , it just stopped working . Too late to return . I now have a flashlight that cost close to $ 40 . 	Projector
It is a good mount but I could n't get my ceiling to hold it and the projector . Maybe it was just my ignorance 	Projector
The picture is great , I was really impressed . This by far beats my first projector , that I purchased last year . 	Projector
The projector works wonders , only exception I have is if it had its own disc reader and mount for external speakers but that would only make the price go up more . Does a great job , fairly easy to set up and use . 	Projector
Bought this to power both mine and my wife 's Droid Incredibles and the ipod nano at the same time with room for more accessories in the future , but it could n't even charge a single incredible by itself . The the phone 's charging indicator would turn on and off repeatedly . It could charge the nano , but if you tried to play it while charging on this thing , it would produce a loud screechy-whiny noise . Do n't know whether it was some kind of ground-loop interference or just dirty power . RMA 'd . 	Radar Detector
First day out . Brand new car , brand new Beltronics RX65 . Got popped by radar on the Taconic state parkway . I came over a ridge , heading north and the trooper was sitting in the valley between the north and south bound lanes facing me . As soon as I got a visual on him I knew he got me . Not even a tiny peep out of the RX65 . He threw it into drive and hightailed it after me . The detector never made a sound . I could not believe my eyes or ears and it cost me $ 145 to Fishkill township . Really disappointed . Bottom line is do n't trust these things to save you . 	Radar Detector
So far , very good , easy to set up product . Detects radar without much interference and detects it EARLY . We 'll see what happens when it gets to 120 degrees here . 	Radar Detector
This is an innovative product and I would like to understand its full feature set . However , it comes with NO MANUAL !! That 's right , no manual . Enclosed in the product package is a Quick Start Guide with instructions on Bluetooth pairing with your iPhone . Period . There is no manual and one is not available on line , in PDF or any other form ! I ca n't believe it ! You can call Cobra 's support number -LRB-773-RRB-889-3087 and tell them . They will tell you that they see no need for it . Never mind the myriad of options , map-related symbols , explanation of how their online alert\/trap database works and any number of questions that you might have ! Do n't buy this and RUN .

Pros : It has excellent radar detection from miles away . It also has really superb kA detection . <p> Cons : Limited rear protection . Rear protection can be maximized by placing the detector high and aimed between the seats on your front windshield . <p> The Bottom Line : Considering BEL and Escort have merged , you can expect nothing but good to come from both now . Buy it ! <p> Recommended : Yes <p> I received my Escort Passport 8500 one week ago . I love it more as time goes on . I used to be very nervous about the local state patrol on our main highway to the next town . My last detector would n't read the signal until we saw each other . I finally got this detector after a lot of reading and after visiting testing sites , like radar test dot COM . First day that I got to try this thing out I was blown away by the distance it was able to detect the radar . I made sure to take note of the distance to the officer by checking the odometer . The officer was using kA band radar . This was the same officer that had stopped me before going 24 over ! One more offense from him or another I could loose my license for a little while . It turns out that I got his radar from an unbelievable seven miles away . I really could n't believe this at first , because I thought it could be a false . I finally realized it was reading true when the signal kept getting stronger . It sure took a while to get to the state patrolman . I would have loved to see his reaction when he knew he could n't get me . My second experience was on a winding hilly road . I got this officer a mile off going around a curve ! I really like all the programmable options I get with this . I personally like to use the expert mode for getting multiple signals from those speed traps . Not to mention those road checks that they do . You ca n't go wrong if you buy this detector . It has a 30 , or 60-day money back guarantee . They value this offer very well . 	Radar Detector
The Whistler DE1610 works flawless . I ` ve had more expensive radar detectors and I was not impressed . Whistler gives me everything I need in a radar detector and at a good price . It can do anything the more expensive detectors say they can do . It ` s a good detector at a good price . 	Radar Detector
Good product . Alittle difficult to set the compass . City mode is the best mode to use . It does pick up some of store motion sensors but all in all its great for the price . 	Radar Detector
I live in Southern Cali , I was stuck between the REDLINE and 9500ix , I bought the redline because of it 's monster long range capability , and it 's off axis vision like a `` V '' -LRB- 9500ix has tunnel vision -RRB- . When i need that long range I GOT IT because everybody will at one point be on that highway wishing they had that extra long range sensitivity . Yeah it does n't have AUTOLOCK like the 9500ix , but you 'll know where to expect those false alarms in your home town . If you want those extra perks the 9500ix has with your redline , get the Escort Live cable -LRB- you get redlight camera alerts , speed camera alerts , false alert lock , ect . -RRB- ... I Did = -RRB- . I 'm happy with it , Get It . 	Radar Detector
My old detector just died after many years of great service . So after researching many reviews I settled on this one . I really wanted the Bell 955 but did n't want to pay the price . I do n't know the diffrence between the two other than features . This one falses a little but all detectors do , to many door openers around town and stuff . The range is excellent , saved my butt already . It definately gets your attention , but then quites down which I like . Built like a brick . Just wish detectors like these would tell you which way the signal is coming from like the valintine detector . 	Radar Detector
Detects radar well . I tested it by driving by an LCD display\/radar gun outside of elementary school . On the downside , I have ben using the detector for only 2 weeks , and can not remove it from the window mount . The button to do this appears to be jammed . 	Radar Detector
It 's easy to use and a nice looking product with blue lights . I thought I was all that when I purchased this item but then I was cruising on the highway when all of the sudden a police car came up next to me and passed me and this item never alerted me . Apparently , as I later learned it only detects some police cars and not the ones on the freeway . Go figure . I would n't recommend the product . 	Radar Detector
This cable has worked out so much better then the cable my Cobra 9945 came with , this one is longer and is straight compared to the short cable the unit came with . For the price of this cable its hard to beat ! 	Radar Detector
I have had a Beltronics V955 for several years and I do n't go anywhere without it . I bought both my sons one for Christmas . We just like to know where they are ... we do n't like any surprises . I call it my police locator ... 	Radar Detector
Company that shipped the product -- Excellent ! , Ahead of schedule and no issue ! The product works as advertised . Has good reception , shows all Ka bands , and with plenty of warnings . Also , the POP feature works well . I am also learning where all the X-band areas are on our trips . I have not run across a Laser . I did see one set up and appeared to be shooting . I think that they have wised up and shoot a very narrow , focussed beam and hence , I think that this unit missed the signal -- or the cop did n't have the laser unit on at the time . I guess I will never know until I get a clear laser signal . There are many features with this product + this one is the stealth one -LRB- can not be seen by radar detector detectors -RRB- . I purchased over the other nonstealth because this one has more of the upgrades and is more sensitive -- the other probably works well , but the company stated that they made this one an enhanced version over the nonstealth model . -RRB- Good luck with either you purchase .

... I bought this Bel 880 to replace a 10 year old Cobra thatwas n't keeping up and after I did alot of internet research . In thefirst hour of the first day using my new Bel , it ` saved ' me twice . Itis an excellent detector for the price , especially for someone whoinsists on driving 10-30 over . Whenever I get a signal I start to doa 360 scan and I can find the ` bad boys ' hiding out . It rarely falsesin City mode , if you really want to eliminate falses , then spend -LRB- more $ $ -RRB- for a detector . Good Luck . 	Radar Detector
This is one of the best car charges available . The fuse blew when I had my iPad , Nokia N8 cell phone , Nokia N95 cell phone and a DVD player . I replaced with the next higher fuse and it works great since then . Just bought a second unit to my other car . 	Radar Detector
For the price range , I doubt that you will find a better detector on the market . I will agree with another reviewer in that I have had my fair share of falses on the ka band , but then again I wonder if I did n't see the squad going over the overpass etc. . The city mode works well eliminating annoying alarm system falses . The `` voice '' is clear and understandable , but the volume control leaves something to be desired . All other settings buttons are easy to use , and the memory -LRB- of your previous settings -RRB- is a big plus . All in all , one could do much worse for the price . 	Radar Detector
Have this radar detector and am pleased with operation . Has all the bells and whistles until it gets hot . Assuming radar detectors are to be mounted on the dash or windshield , when this baby gets in the sun , you get a display memo that tells you to contact Bel for information . Upon contacting Bel , I find out that if the unit gets too hot , it shuts itself down and has to be sent in to repair at $ 40 a shot plus your shipping . This unit was a gift and therefore , I could stick the warranty in my ass . No receipt , no service . Unit was 8 months old when it overheated and Bel would n't do anything without a receipt . I called numerous times to get it repaired or replaced , to no avail . One would think when you spend $ 600 for a radar detector , you might just get some customer service . With Beltronics , you can keep it for a paper weight . Beltronics has the worst customer service in the industry . As they say in China : no ticky , no laundry . 	Radar Detector
It just works . smells troubles miles away . I am not a speeder and do not believe in worthy of extra 10 mph at 5 mpg cost . But those once in a while situations , this radar detector had saved my behind several times . Well worth the investment . Recommend having it professionally installed top of the windshield and power connection to the mirror as the danging power cord can be quite annoying . Hope that helped you make a deceision . Or BTW , before pulling the plug I drove 1000 miles with 3 RDs installed , 955 , 995 and Passport 9500ix . 995 and 9500ix worned head to head , 955 was sometimes a bit behind . 	Radar Detector
I decided to buy this because in my car -LRB- thanks to the location of the cigarette lighter -RRB- it was impossible to use the shorter , springy power cord that came with the radar detector . The instructions are simple -LRB- available online at -LRB- ... -RRB- , also pasted below -RRB- , and what really took me the longest was finding the right fuse to use and then a ground screw to connect the other terminal . But that 's really more a function of your car than of the product . Once I got that sorted out the rest was easy and it works and looks great ! INSTRUCTIONS -LRB- from Cobra website at -LRB- ... -RRB- -RRB- : 1 . Connect the fused wire to a fuse in the fuse box . The fuse for the radio is recommended . To connect the wire to a blade-type fuse , it is recommended to use a fuse tap available from Radio Shack . Part number 270-1204 for standard blade fuses , or part number 270-1218 for mini-blade fuses . 2 . Plug the cable into the radar detector and turn on the detector . 3 . Turn on the ignition . 4 . Touch the other wire to various screws under the dash . When the detector turns on , you have found a ground screw . Attach the wire to this screw . 5 . Carefully run the cable to the detector , avoiding the brake and gas pedals . This completes installation . 	Radar Detector
This radar is pretty awesome , it picks up pretty quickly . Have n't had a POP hit me yet so I 'm not for sure what will happen when it does . The last Beltronics that I had made all kind of noises when it came across one . The one con I have is when you turn the volume down on it it still comes across as loud and then after a few chirps ti will return to the volume setting that I had it on , do n't know why it does it , it can be a little annoying . For the price you ca n't beat it . 	Radar Detector
I love it , it is real accurate and has saved me several times already . Comes with easy mounting bracket and plenty of cord length . 	Radar Detector
My previous radar detector , Bel 540i , died after 12 years of use , so I 've had no doubts about the replacement : another Bel unit , this time Bel 940 . I have an embedded Escort Passport in one of my cars , and Bel was always working just as good , for a lot less money . Actually , better , because Escort is prone to false laser alarms when the sun is just the right hight above the horizon , or when an Audi -LRB- for some reason , specifically Audi -RRB- with xenon healight stops behind me at a traffic light . Well , the display on Escort is a bit more entertaning but that does n't affect the functionality much . The new unit so far works just as good as the old one , and better . For the background , I 'll go through the issues that I had with the old Bel 540 . What failed after 12 years , is not the electronics but the power connector . The 940 has a much better power connector . A few years ago the power wire wore through near the plug , and guess what , 940 has a much better quality power wire . The hanger with adjustable angle was getting loose once in a while , now the hanger is solid metal , adjustable by bending . The suction cups crack over time , and 940 comes with an extra spare set of suction cups ! Well , not that I use them any more : I 've found that 3Ms velcro-like hook-and-hook strips are a much better way to mount anything on the dashboard . And now there is the volume adjustment , so that it can be made quiter , and the display is a bit better . And a quicker and less noisy power-on sequence . The display is not quite as entertaining as on Escort but more readable than before . I think the sensitivity is also a bit higher but I 'm not sure that it 's such a good thing , because it gives more false alarms . What 's worse : That gray panel on top does reflect in the windshield more , but it 's not a big deal . The power cord used to be straight , now it 's coiled . Quite annoying , but overall not such a big deal either . The price got higher , I guess if I did n't have such a good experience with previous Bel , I would not have bought this one , and went for something cheaper instead -LRB- if you wonder about Escort , I have n't bought it , I won it in a raffle -RRB- . But I guess , taking the inflation into account , it 's OK and the discounted price is still about the price of a single speeding ticket . What does n't matter : the voice announcements . They get quite tiresome in one day , so I 've just turned them off . 	Radar Detector
This is a great unit for the price , it detects 11 bands of radar and it gives plenty of warning time for you to take action . Pay no attention to the above review . . This unit is VG-2 Undetectable , it never claims to be undetectable to Spectre . I have tested my 9870 on a spectre and vg-2 , I get alerts on both tests and vg-2 ca n't see my radar . <p> But since I live in the United States , it is not against the law for me to own a radar detector , hence I have no need for these special features . <p> Great unit for a great price !!

I was pretty skeptical about radar detectors , but I recently bought a BMW and have been driving rather `` aggressively '' , and thought maybe this would be a good investment taking into account ticket costs and insurance premium increases if pulled over . I chose this one because it seemed the best bang for the buck , with good reviews on Amazon . Lo and behold , during my first road trip with it -LRB- 3hrs -RRB- , I successfully detected 5-6 police cars who were checking for speeders . PROS : - Detects well , Ka is 95 % true positive . K , X , and Laser for me have been 100 % false positives . - Clear screen - Easy to use - Auto-mute is great for false positives - Not too many false positives -LRB- average per car ride around city is 1-2 , on highway is less than 1 -RRB- - Auto-off is great if you 're lazy and do n't want to turn it off when you get out of the car CONS : - Could make your car look a bit ugly , but you guys know what you 're getting into when buying this - Detection range as listed by the manufacturer is a bit optimistic . When I have it low on my windshield -LRB- behind the nav screen , for example -RRB- , I can detect about 1-1 .5 miles out under average conditions . More than enough time to slow down , but can be a bit startling when you start seeing that red `` Ka '' text and you need to slow down ... 	Radar Detector
Continuing its fine lineup of radar detectors , Escort has unveiles its latest , the 8500 . Encased in anodized aluminum silver , this package is one piece of art . Dont let looks fool you though , this baby performs . It has all the standard features of your hi-end radar detector : X , K , Ka and Laser detection , VG2 undetectability , multiple modes : City , Highway and Auto which is their logic mode that lets the CPU decide between bogeys and false alarms . It also is programmable that lets you customize your preferences like turn off x or k band detection . It comes with its SmartCord too that allows you to kill the display on the radar and have an indicator light in its mini-panel on your cigarette lighter . It also has auto-mute that automatically lowers the audible signal after a few seconds . Its best features are the SWS messaging and rear detection . SWS lets you know of road conditions ahead like constructions and crossing firetrucks . The rear detection feature has a tiny sensor mounted on top of the radar that detects rear threats . <p> It 's a real great product , it does what it is supposed to do and that is to detect radar . It does it too well though , picking up false alarms like automatic doors and burglar alarms even in auto mode . My office faces a Home Depot and it constantly sounds off whenever i park facing it . Well at least it reminds me to take it off the dash when i park because its silver finish just attracts too much attention 	Radar Detector
I love this radar detector !! I had a older beltronic model that was out dated but still worked , so I did my research on roadtest.com and bought this shortly after !! I put it to a test two days later driving from atlanta , ga to destin , fl . This detector picked off six hiding speed traps on the way down and eight on the way back !! Wow the detector has already paid for itself 5 times over !! Take the pop mode off to reduce false alams\/leave on autoscan around town -LRB- info from roadtest.com -RRB- - this one is a keeper !!!!!!!!!!!! 	Radar Detector
This product unfortunately does not work for the Brazilian radars . The information I have is that only works for mobile radars . As in Brazil radars mostly work by electromagnetic waves , it was a useless purchase . Too bad the site does not do warning to Brazilian buyers not to purchase this item . 	Radar Detector
The 8500 series Passports have been around for slightly over a decade and have seen two major revisions . This is the current , 2011 , revision . I own all three revisions -LRB- 8500 , 8500 X50 , and now 8500 X50 Black -RRB- , and I give this product a lot of praise . For most drivers , this is one of the best choices in its price range . The X-band performance on all models has been great . For this revision , K and Ka bands have seen substantial improvements , as has the ` ramp-up ' , which is how a signal has a progressive increase to and decrease from the target . Its laser performance and filtering is unchanged . Like the previous model , its filtering is the best in the business . It 's off axis detection seems to be improved , thanks to a newer type of lens . The speaker is LOUD , which is what you want , and the tone sounds are very distinct . Like the previous models -LRB- and virtually all detectors -RRB- , do NOT rely on it for LIDAR -LRB- laser -RRB- detection . For that you need a LIDAR jammer . The black color is a nice change as it does not clash with interiors and it looks much sharper than the previous silver colored one . The display is as crisp as always and the included true hard-carry and padded zipper case is a nice upgrade from the plastic box . This is a true travel case and great for the mobile user . As always , the mounting hardware and SmartCord are excellent -LRB- the SmartCord allows you to mute an alert without touching the unit and seeing an active alarm when the unit is in ` Dark ' mode . The frequency display , expert meter , band customization , city sensitivity customization , voltage display and more give users many features allowing them to customize the unit for their area and specific driving . If you are n't a customizer , then it is ready to go out-of-the-box and is VERY simple to use and reprogram -LRB- of so desired -RRB- . Escort 's extended warranty of an additional 2 years for $ 30 is very reasonable as well and their 30-day risk-free trial is also nice given this is a big purchase . Being able to get it with a blue display is nice , although I swear by the red myself as I find it easier to read , especially at night . It does , however , lack a few features . The first is voice alerts . Some people love these , and some hate them . I love them , but it is n't a major issue IMO . It also lacks substantial protection against ` quick trigger ' radar , which is instant on radar that goes from asleep-to on-to lock a speed-and back to ` sleep ' . It is simply not fast enough to detect this short signal , which is very common in some areas . However , it is not used at all in others and for its price point I would not let this discourage you from buying it . It also does not detect the 16 millisecond K-band POP2 -LRB- it 's POP settings detect the 33.6-33 .8 GHz Ka-band 67 millisecond POP -RRB- , and turning POP on will greatly increase false alerts with a reduction in distance on all non-POP frequencies . However , unlike QT , POP is very rare . The Bottom Line ? ... Well , perhaps everything I have thus far said makes no sense if you are n't a radar detector person ... if that is the case , let me sum it up in a not-so-dorky fashion . The detector offers good to excellent range on virtually every type of radar , still has the same laser limitations of other detectors -LRB- get a jammer -RRB- , looks really good in person , has a lot of features that let you customize your unit for you , and is VERY easy to use . It has made some substantial improvements over the previous two silver-colored models , and so I would look at the X50 Black -LRB- which is this model -RRB- over them . So in layman 's terms this is a pretty darn good pick for most users and is an excellent overall value . 	Radar Detector
... But now both of my units have stopped working altogether because the connection no longer worked . It started with just an annoying little wiggle to get the thing to come on and gradually croaked . Personally , I have never had any luck with power cords that are not flexible . If the straight cords get stuck on something , off the dashboard they go . Just my 2 cents worth . 	Radar Detector
It works well , much better then stock cups . For those having issues with the cups curling up , if you use rubbing alcohol on the cup before applying it it will create sort of `` vacuum '' when pressed onto a hot windshield and prevent the edges from curling . 	Radar Detector
I decided to buy this because of the price . I 've seem some of the really expensive ones they have out there , but it was out of my price range . I like what I have gotten for my money . It shows me the different bands and the strength of the signal . A problem that I have noticed with it is that sometimes it will go off when there is nothing there , usually the X band with a strength of 1 or 2 . It also is hopeless if an officer hits you with laser . However , it is definately a good detector for $ 100 . 	Radar Detector
I have had one of these for almost 10 years and it has never failed -LRB- still in use -RRB- . I can assure you that it has saved me on many occasions , -LRB- including Laser -RRB- . you have to learn it 's habits and also set it up properly . So when my wife needed a new detector for her car -LRB- old bel 20 years old died -RRB- I bought this type for her . i noticed some people saying it does n't work for them , i can only say that once you understand how a radar detector works and set your unit up -LRB- mine came shipped with laser set to off even though the manual said the default was on -RRB- i think it does the job very well and is very reliable .

I received my 955 3 days ahead of the estimated delivery date ... way to go Amazon ! Some people say the unit is heavy . . I prefer to call it `` solid . '' It 's bigger and heavier than my 6-yr old unit , but hey , not all electronics are miniturized and this unit has a lot of features . No problem mounting to windshield or with the unit not sitting snug . . no unwanted vibration or noise . I know the unit works . . it picks up traffic speed signs more than a mile away , and I dodged one speed trap already . I especially like the feature where the unit `` announces '' the type of radar so I do n't have to take my eyes off the road . Brightness settings are good and sound volume is okay out of the box -LRB- adjustable -RRB- if you are not listening to the radio\/CD at 105 decibles . So far , it 's been a great unit .

I have had several other brands of radar detectors ranging from $ 50 to $ 150 . None can even compare . Of course none were the brand escort either . I do not know if this quality is standard among their product line but this radar detector is awesome . It has an auto feature that automatically senses where you are at while you are driving . It minimizes false alarms and its range is unbelievable . Around corners , long straight-aways , hills , you name it , it does it . The only thing it lacks is a voice alert which I like but is not needed . 	Radar Detector
I bought this recently to replace my old 955 and RX65 . The RX65 was the best radar for me . The protection range was so long . Several times on highways , the RX65 detected the Ka band and it was right ALL THE TIME and the distance from my car to the police car were amazing far . STI does pickup Ka band but it happens twice now that the police cars were in front of me merely less than half mile . This morning , the police car was so close . Perhaps the policeman just turned on the radar , but perhaps not . I really do n't like the protection range of 955 and it seems the STI is about the same . I miss the RX65 . 	Radar Detector
I purchased this detector a month or so ago , and have been running it through it 's paces ever since . There are lots of speed traps in the area where I drive , so I 've had several opportunities to test it out . <p> Conclusions : 1 -RRB- A radar detector is not a substitute for defensive driving . You still need to be aware of where speed traps are likely to be set up and behave accordingly -LRB- slow down , keep a car in front of you , etc. -RRB- . <p> 2 -RRB- The police obviously spend a great deal of time trying to hide in places to make radar detection difficult . Even the best radar detector may not save you , or at best will give you only a moment 's notice . <p> 3 -RRB- The Escort seems to behave well in stopping false warnings , and warning me of threats . It does not give me tonnes of time to react . I 've read all of the reports indicating how much more sensitive the Passport is , but in real life this only translates into fractional seconds in the conditions where speed traps are likely . I 'm not a habitual speeder , so I do n't tend to worry about normal conditions where I 'll stumble upon a policeman who happens to be running radar while they 're driving . I 'm more concerned about defeating specific speed traps where the speed limit is n't reflective of safe driving conditions . <p> 4 -RRB- The Passport detects POP radar , and it 's OS is upgradable , which should extend it 's effective lifespan quite a bit . <p> 5 -RRB- There are many bells and whistles which allow you to completely configure the detector to meet your needs , including displaying the exact frequency of the most important threat . This is very valuable in mapping out false alarms in your area . <p> No matter how many bells and whistles , nor the name recognition of the manufacturer , will keep you from getting a ticket if the detector is n't sensitive enough . Though the Passport passes the sensitivity test , I do n't know that it is clearly superior to detectors costing 1\/2 the price . Thus the 4 star rating . 	Radar Detector
Hum , -LRB- ... -RRB- did not post my first review . Perhaps because I gave this item 1 star . So I posted another one at 2 stars to see if it does n't get filtered . I 'm also posting here on Amazon . Bottom line , do n't waste your time . This is a terrible radar detector . It detected X and K for the brief time I used it . Ran it along side my Valentine One . The V1 gave me anywhere from a 10 sec to 30 sec warning . The ST goes off only when you are w\/in a hundred yards or so and the cops radar is at full blast . By then it 's too late and you 'll be paying a ticket . It also only works with head on radar . I drove beside a cop w\/my V1 going nuts and the ST was quiet as can be . The good news is that this detector does n't false alarm . They achieve this by tuning the sensitivity down so low you miss out on true radar signals . You 've been warned . I returned mine for a refund . I could go on and on about other things wrong here but why bother . 	Radar Detector
This detector worked great right out of the box . No adjustments necessary . I bought it , plugged it in and took a 2,500 mile road trip . I was warned about every speed trap and cop in five states . Very happy with this purchase . I had a Passport\/Escort back in the 80 's . This Beltroncs worked exactly as I wanted considering all the new technologies out there . The window mount was secure and easy to use . I really liked the audio voice alert that accompanies the chirping sound . I put my butt on the line with this product and it came through for me . Loved using it !! 	Radar Detector
This is one of the best radar detectors I 've ever owned . The city filtering mode works great , with little false alarms . It 's easy to understand and operate , and best of all it does a great job of letting you know of any threats . Personally , the voice alert is so annoying I just leave if off , because when it detects something and it cuts off and detects it again , the voice alert message repeats over and over again ! I love testing it out on the speed traps around town -LRB- little do the cops know -RRB- ! 	Radar Detector
Excellent product . . my last detector was stolen by personnel at Motel 6 and I opted to replace it in kind . . had a 985 before and spilled soda on it . . great units . . never had a problem and always got great satisfaction 	Radar Detector
I have had this detector for years now and was preparing to buy another for my motorcycle . I decided to review it . Some of the reviewers have said that you are dead meat by the time the laser detector goes off . Not so !! This thing saved my bacon on a recent cross country trip on I-70 . The laser warning went off and I almost thought it was a false alert until I cleared some trees . The patrolman had apparently targeted a vehicle that was 1\/4 to 1\/2 mile ahead of me and the RX65 picked up the signal -LRB- from scatter I assume -RRB- . If you are the lead car of a group -LRB- which I try not to be -RRB- , or on your own , both POP radar and laser are a definite danger with any detector . The advantage of this detector is that it is so sensitive that it can pick up POP that was directed at another vehicle far away . It is as good as you are going to get . The options are great including dark mode for nighttime driving . -LRB- Keeps it from being seen at night and provides eye relief . -RRB- I have found it to be bullet reliable and plenty loud . You can also shut it up , which is great when you are on the same road as a traveling radar patrol car . X band and K band are common in other than enforcement uses . The false alerts that some reviewers report are more than likely due to this . KA detection is great and a lifesaver . KA is low power and harder to detect effectively . I am confident that you will never be surprised by any moving patrol using radar . Fixed ambushes are another story because of POP and laser , but as reported above , it still gives you a fighting chance . Every passenger who has ever experienced it while riding with me has said they have never seen a better unit , period . 	Radar Detector
"I 've been using radar detectors for 25 + years . First a cheap Cobra , then a nicer Whistler , another Whistler , and then finally I stepped up to the plate and bought a Beltronics Vector 980 which at the time -LRB- 9 years ago -RRB- was one of the best on the market . During that 25 year period , I have only received ONE speeding ticket , and that was from a motorcycle cop hiding in the driveway of a private residence behind the homeowner 's truck reaching around the canopy with his radar gun and doing the `` instant on '' thing -LRB- I guess they were getting desperate for some revenue ... . lol -RRB- . Under those circumstances NO radar detector would have saved me as I was the only car on the road ... . Still , my driving record is totally clean -LRB- driver diversion class for that one ticket ... -RRB- , and , while I 've spent maybe $ 700 on radar detectors over the past 25 years , I 've saved THOUSANDS of dollars in tickets\/fines\/court costs and increased car insurance premiums . So , if you 're wondering if a radar detector is worth the money , YES , they are !!! Anyway , after 9 years of faithful service , my 980 is finally starting to die : lot 's of false alarms , self-cal and low voltage warnings , etc. . After speaking with Beltronics Tech Support -LRB- who are located in the U.S. and very helpful ! -RRB- it became pretty obvious that it was time for a new detector as my 980 is acting like it 's on the way out . Even though I 've been very pleased with my Beltronics 980 , I did want to read all the relevant reviews to see what detectors are the best bang for the buck these days . Basically , if you want a top-quality radar detector , you have to spend at least $ 200 and you want to buy from Beltronics or Escort -- it 's really that simple . Both companies are currently offering an $ 80 `` Cash for clunkers '' rebate where you can send in any old detector -LRB- working or not -RRB- and get $ 80 off any of their current models . A pretty good deal , though -LRB- ... -RRB- price without the rebate and free prime shipping on the V995 was still lower ... . I thought briefly about making the switch to Escort -- I like the smaller profile of the Passport and they are highly rated . But after reading some of the reviews here and at other sites , it seemed like there was a fairly high failure rate of these units after a year or so of use . Given that repairing this type of electronics is almost always cost-prohibitive , I decided to just stick with Beltronics , after all , my 980 lasted for over 9 years !!! In reading the review sites -LRB- just google `` best radar detector '' -RRB- it became clear that the Beltronics GX65 is among the top dogs . Its got all the bells and whistles , including GPS . It 's also got a $ 469 price tag ... I think GPS is a nice feature . It would be nice to add grocery stores and other false alarms along my most-traveled routes to the GPS-enabled RD to keep it silent . It 's also nice to be able to plot out and store the locations of the seemingly never ending mine field of photo radar speed cameras . However , for me a GPS-enabled unit did n't make sense . This V995 costs only $ 209 , $ 260 less than the GPS-enabled GX65 . Yet for less than the $ 260 difference between these two RD 's , you can buy a good <ahref=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001ELJER4/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/192-7777257-5431167""> Garmin n&uuml;vi 765\/765T 4.3-Inch Bluetooth Portable GPS Navigator with Traffic </a> that will not only allow you to maintain a database of known red light cameras and speed cameras , but also help you to navigate , avoid traffic jams , find nearby restaurants , gas stations , etc. . By utilizing the POI -LRB- point of interest -RRB- database in the GPS unit , you can customize the POI 's in your GPS to include speed traps , red light cameras , speed cameras , etc and then warn you as you are approaching these areas giving you time to check your speed . At the Garmin website are links to a dozen or so POI databases that provide all of this information for free . The next model in the Beltronics lineup is the RX65 which retails for $ 339.95 Yet several tests rated the V995 BETTER in radar detection , and it 's $ 150 less ... Yes , the RX65 has a few more bells and whistles , but not nearly enough to justify the much higher price IMHO . It 's worth noting that the V995 retails for $ 295 at the Beltronics website . So far , I 'm very happy with the V995 . I 've been running the 980 and the 995 together for about 2 weeks now just to test sensitivity of the V995 -LRB- my 980 still works very well on detecting actual radar -- it 's just getting waaaaay too many false alarms -RRB- . I really like the fact that the V995 comes with the `` smart cord , '' I saw earlier reviews that stated it did not , but mine did . The V995 mounting bracket is simple , yet very strong and effective , and I really like that the V995 locks onto the mounting bracket with a push-button lock on the top of the V995 . This means that if you 're running some errands and you want to hide or take your RD with you to prevent theft , you can quickly remove it from the bracket without having to remove the bracket from the windshield . Still , if you 're in a high crime area it 's probably best to remove the bracket from your windshield as crafty thieves will look for RD and GPS suction cup mounts hoping that the owner has just hidden the RD in the glove box or under the seat and then bust out your window just to find out ... . I also really like the auto-mute feature on the V995 . Essentially , once it pics up a signal it will beep 2-3 times loudly so that you are alerted , and then it will mute the sound but keep the lights flashing so you can track the alert over the next few minutes without the annoying beeping or the need to push the mute button . Another great feature is the autoscan feature -LRB- which I now use the most -RRB- that allows you to not have to choose between City or Highway mode -LRB- for increased\/decreased sensitivity -RRB- it will autoscan the area you 're driving in and switch itself between Hwy and City as needed . So , all the protection without the false-alarms from cell phone towers , motion detectors , and other cheap radar detectors . The end result is a very quiet , yet very sensitive radar detector -- and that 's what you really want . My V995 has been great -- it even gave me plenty of warning last week for a laser speed trap -- though when you hear the `` laser alert ! '' warning you need to slow down NOW ! It gives me virtually no false alarms , and it mounts securely to the windshield . It comes with the smart cord , the windshield mount -LRB- and Beltronics even included a spare set of suction cups -- a nice touch -RRB- and a well made zippered case to store everything in . Sure , you could spend more money if you want to , but for $ 209 for the V995 , this is hands down the best radar detector bang-for-your-buck !!! "	Radar Detector

Being a satisfied user of a Bel Express 936 in my 02 WRX , I looked to Bel for a radar detector to go in a new Cooper S in Jul 05 -LRB- mainly my wife 's daily driver -RRB- . The Vector 995 was reasonably priced and feature laden and seemed to perform well in tests carried out by radartest.com , so I bought one . The 995 is more noticeably more sensitive than my older 936 , it starts chirping sooner when a police radar is around , while simultaneously being a slightly less susceptible to false alarms . Possibly due to the Autoscan feature . I 'm happy with it . So when we bought a V6 RAV 4 as some sensible family transport -LRB- our first baby arrives in a couple of weeks -RRB- I could have taken the 936 from the WRX , but since I plan on keeping that car , at least for few more months , a 2nd Vector 995 went right into the RAV . Not that I expect to be seriously violating speed limits with junior on board , . Pros : Autoscan , Programmable , Sensitive , fewer false alarms Cons : Automute too quiet , mounting bracket allows a bit too much flex . 	Radar Detector
Smokey does n't know what 's hit him . My new V955 is guiding me thru the streets of South Texas , so far so good . My little friend is a solid , easy to use partner in crime and I 'm glad I did n't shell out the extra $ 100-300 for the newest models available . 	Radar Detector
Using a visor clip on a sedan I detected many different police radar usually within excess of a mile . Not all police will keep their radar active however and will sometimes deliberately try and sneak up on those that use radar detectors by only activating it while you have already passed them . Functions well for detecting numerous radar enabling for sudden slow down when hit . I was surprised when making my return trip that many different laser radar were being used and I was hit by at least 5 of them -LRB- some very aggressively -RRB- , as opposed to the first drive . I reacted very quickly however even though I was driving quickly , and this reaction may have been the only thing that prevented me from being pulled over -LRB- which I assume is because it could be argued from what he tracked me at , that the laser detector was n't accurate and that I would only have appeared to be going at the speed they clocked me at near the end . -RRB- I 've still just come back from my trip and have yet to sleep -LRB- I drove one way non-stop ; not recommended though it should work best if you have just woken up and head out immediately , though I did n't do that for the return trip -RRB- so I have n't spent many days after the drive to know if I might be receiving traffic tickets in the mail , and ca n't be sure if I might have had aerial surveillance at various points of the trip -LRB- I did n't particularly heed the warning signs about video surveillance and noticed others were speeding faster than I was while in Illinois and soon discover a surveillance plane zooming past near the end check mark . In other words their are other ways to still get tickets without radar , including stop light tickets . I did n't spray or add any photo obstruction to the license plate and supposedly they only prevent photos getting clear images using camera flash . -RRB- I do n't generally advocate speeding because it only seems to save you as much time when on a highway , and at most you might only save 10 minutes out of an hours drive , which could just as well be time spent wasted at a gas station -LRB- much higher gas consumption after certain speeds -RRB- or fiddling with your gps -LRB- which I 've noticed may not give you the quickest directions and are prone to lock up on occasions if you use via points to the final destination . -RRB- In all it might seem very stupid to drive as opposed to flying for the very reason that getting speeding tickets could easily cost much more than the difference of a plane ticket -LRB- if preferring to drive was somehow cost effective and for this reason was utilized -RRB- or the likelihood of safety hazards in excess of plane travel safety . What this radar detector allowed me to do was be able to make more confident driving decisions enabling me to explore various parts of the US that would have otherwise been overlooked or ignored without some degree of driving security -LRB- though it could be argued this detector gives a false sense of security because it encourages reckless driving -- by definition -RRB- . I have the older -LRB- S7 setup -RRB- with smart cord and external speaker -LRB- a necessity for high speed travel and whenever using loud music , even if you find the built-in speaker loud at first . -RRB- Everything was setup using the fuse panel -LRB- which btw does n't allow my fuse panel to close with Add-A-Circuit sticking up from it , though I managed to fasten a string\/rope around it to prevent it from flapping down while driving -RRB- . If speeding tickets were 100 % preventable than I would tend to prefer driving as opposed to plane travel , even if it takes much longer and does n't have the security that something like a semi-truck has with tire blowouts . All the radar detector allows you to do is to be cautious . 	Radar Detector
I bought this for $ 70 on a deal . This is my 1st detector and really worth the money . After my research for 2 months I made up my mind to buy this . I saved a couple of tickets . It works well for regular base user and alerts well before u see the cop . U have enough time to reduce ur seed before beign caught . Only problem is it detects many ` K ' bands used by local stores . So u can see from this that this detector detects even the bands which are not in the line of the car path . A really great feature is the signal strength it shows when it catches a band . If the cop is hidden far away from the road then the signal strength is less but still u get the alert . Voice prompts are clear . I recommend this for a ` budget ' minded buyer . 	Radar Detector
I 'm sorry to have to write a review like this , but I wish someone else had . It would have saved me the time and trouble of buying and returning this ` severely challenged ' radar detector . <p> I ` tested ' the Bel Express 936 for a little more than a week . During that week I drove approx . 900 miles , experiencing a variety of driving conditions , from high-rise inner-city business districts to two-lane rural mountain roads . <p> Really , the only good thing I have to say about this radar detector is it is quiet - the quietest radar detector I have ever owned . As a matter of fact , it does n't do much of anything except look pretty . For those of you that are looking for an attractive radar detector that does n't make a lot of noise , this Bel is for you . Everyone else , keep reading . <p> There is hardly any reason to comment on the windshield bracket . However , if this is the first Bel radar detector review you have read , Bel makes the worst windshield bracket in the industry , so I wo n't belabor the point . Take my word for it , and countless others . The same criticism applies to the flimsy visor clamp . The ` Velcro ' strip is n't bad if you have a dash mat . <p> The digital readout seems like a dandy idea in the store . In the real world , however , you will find that it is too bright at night and too dim during the day . It is , for the most part , useless . LED indicators would have been a much better idea . <p> How about the voice alert ? This actually works pretty well . The only problem is you ca n't hear it , since the speaker is mounted on the right-hand side of the case . <p> Another major complaint is the power plug location . Bel put it on the left-hand side of the case ensuring the drooping power cord is constantly in your way . <p> The only logical place to mount this unit is on the dash -LRB- using the hook-n-loop strip -RRB- , next to the A-pillar . Once there , you can easily get to the top-mounted buttons , hear the voice alerts , and ignore the annoying digital display . The power cord is also out of the way . This , of course , does n't address the biggest problem of all - the fact that the unit itself does n't work very well . How bad is it ? <p> As you may have figured out by now , the Bel Express 936 is a ` Sleeping Beauty . ' It DOES detect radar , but it does n't give you much time to do anything about it . When and if this unit actually goes off , you had better believe a traffic cop has you locked in his sights . My experience has been that this detector will give you anywhere from a few hundred feet to a 1\/4 mile of warning . That 's it ! And , that 's only if the cop is directly in front of you . You can forget about cops to the side and rear of your vehicle . I can assure you this radar detector does ! This thing is so dead to the world that it does n't even ` max-out ' when you pass within a few feet of a bogie . <p> I am now ` testing ' a Bel 980 . I was so disappointed by the Bel Express 936 , that I decided to buy Bel 's top-of-the-line radar detector . Why ? My thoughts were this . I decided if the 980 did n't work any better than the Express 936 , I would return it and never buy another Bel product . I am pleased to report that I have ` tested ' the Bel 980 for an equal amount of time and distance , and it 'll be a ` keeper . ' <p> Really , my friends , if are interested enough in the Bel Express 936 to have read this far , please , listen to me . Do n't buy this radar detector . In the end , you will feel like a jilted lover . Save your milk money and buy a Bel 980 instead . I will post a review of the Bel 980 soon , and it wo n't read like this . 	Radar Detector
This is a very solid and reliable product . Very few false alarms , laser is awesome , but generally to late . Not fault of product but basic caracteristic of the laser beam itself . 	Radar Detector
This seems to be a good detector . I got caught in Ohio by a cop that just turned on his laser . The detector lit up and sounded off like the 4th of July , but the laser was just turned on so they got me . You really need a radar and laser jammer nowadays . The mount sucks . Use a grip pad for the dash , or maybe hang from the mirror in states were its legal to have these . I hava n't been using as a result of the laser problem . But it has definitely saved me a few potential tickets . I did n't even know they were using those new sport looking Dodge sedans for law enforcement in Mi til i bought this beltronics . Great at detection , but that 's not enough . 	Radar Detector
OK so I had this for about 6 months before it died . I kinda think it was the SmartPlug that died , but have n't bought a new one to verify . I also never got around to trying to get service while it was under warranty , so I ca n't speak to whether or not they 're helpful in that case , but I doubt that they would be . In those 6 months , it never really `` saved me '' for sure , but it certainly made a lot of noise . I live in an urban area , and apparently radar is around every corner . I guess it 's kind of like `` better safe than sorry '' , so slow down when it beeps , but at some point it 's like ... OK I guess I 'll just drive under the speed limit . Now that LADAR -LRB- Laser RADAR -RRB- is getting more popular , these things wo n't help you so much . By the time they detect the LADAR , you 're done for . Mostly I 'm just a bit peeved that I paid hundreds of dollars for this thing and it stopped working after 6 months . To me , that 's unacceptable . I would n't buy it again . 	Radar Detector
I bought this radar detector right before I went on a 400 mile trip back and forth to my home town . 3 Times the detetctor gave me PLENTY of warning of speed traps . It worked perfectly . It started with one bar strength and got progresively stronger until , what do you know , there was the police car on the side of the rode . I should note ... Every time the detector pointed out a speedtrap it was a KA signal detected . $ 200 seems a little pricy but I know I saved myself from at least 2 major speeding tickets which would have been much pricer plus points on my license plus higher insurance payments . And this is just within the first week of owning it . Translation , this product is well worth the money . 1ST DRAWBACK ... false alarms are annoying . Although the auto-mute feature makes the false alarms not as annoying . Also , the volume adjustor is great so that when the radar does go off it is n't rediculously loud like so many other detectors I have heard . 2nd DRAWBACK ... OVER CONFIDENCE !! with the detector you feel invincible ... you have to remember that this device does n't protect you from everything . I have driven by a couple officers without the device going off at all and my reaction was to get pissed and i thought the device was defective but that probably just meant the cop was n't running his radar at the moment I passed him . And if I was speeding bad enough he still could have pulled me over . 	Radar Detector
The suctions cups have a wider diameter than the OEM . The only issue is the suction cups seemed to loose their curvature and flatten out after a few uses so the radar detector detector falls off the windshield . 	Radar Detector
I 've had this detector for over 2 years now , and I have no complains whatsoever -LRB- well , except the annoying false alarms -RRB- . Great deal , high quality 	Radar Detector
The city setting on this unit is terrible . You can not drive in any halfway busy area without it going off constantly on K or Ka band . My old passport that finally died was 500 percent better than this . I just returned from a drive to Portland Or . and this thing drove us nuts . 	Radar Detector
In the one week I have owned it , the V995 seems to work well . I previously used a seven year old Escort 8500 . The power cord was a pleasnt surprise - smartcord type . 	Radar Detector
The unit seems to work fine . However , be prepared to find some way other than the supplied suction cups to mount it . The suction cups lost their shape and will no longer stick to the windshield . The fancy carrying case is totally useless , and I doubt that many people would want to use the external speaker . I believe that these items should be offered as optional accessories rather than being included with the detector . This would substantially reduce the price of the detector . 	Radar Detector
False alarms are a major issue with the Whistler PRO-68SE model . City mode or highway mode does not seem to reduce the number of constant false alarms . This purchase was a waste of my money ! Update : Houston has many , many red light cameras with sensors that will fire this unit off ! -LRB- Per Whistler Factory Rep -RRB- Also , this unit does not have the tight controlled frequency bands of the older or more expensive newer units ! -LRB- Again , Per Whistler Factory Rep -RRB- Blowing smoke up my \* % # ! $ 29.95 sucker unit ! I stated `` my '' review and each has his own . Semper Fi 	Radar Detector
Started a new job which required driving through 3 towns which use tickets to ` balance ' their budgets . I watch my speed but there are times I am in ` never never ' land of deep thought and BBAAMMM theres a cop . I am not encouraging speeding but i am saying this bad boy keeps me alert . I go on windy roads with hills and I have never been surprised . Even coming up hundreds of yards away on an intersection I will catch radar from car coming towards that intersection BUT from the side road ; not the one I am on . Totally impressed and worth the money . 	Radar Detector
Just like the others said . The best one out there . I got this RX-65 Pro about 3 month man it 's worth the price . I travel around 1000 miles every other week . It has been a wonderful tool , It 's worth the money . 	Radar Detector
The above mentioned product was exactly what I needed . It fit my detector with no problem . It arrived in plenty of time , in fact , way before it should have . 	Radar Detector
When I decided to purchase this detector after seeing it in stores , I went to Cobra 's web site . I read about it , and found the price on this product to be $ 5 more than the store . I decided to check this site and a variety of others to see if they had this product . WOW , The price on the cobra site much more than the price here . This is my 5th detector purchase . I also have purchased and still own Bell 's , Cobras , Valentine one , and unadins . Although I have found this detector to be second best to my Valentine one , This detector is 120 dollars as opposed to the four hundred range . As with any detector except the V1 , this detector really detects about 180 degrees . It does not have seperate rear detectors . However rear detecton is verry rarely necessary unless you are going below the min . speed limit . I found this detector to be on par or better than any other detectors I own . It 's sound needs to be louder , but it 's actual detectoin is supurb . This detector preforms like a detector more than twice it 's price . If you are looking for 250 detecton at a 100 dollar price , this is your best shot . 	Radar Detector
Goes off alot on automatic doors with K band . But when there is a cop with radar , watch out !! This thing finds them a mile out and quick . A little expensive , but great performance . 	Radar Detector
I have a Valentine one and I bought this for my GF cause she drives 30-40 min to go to work . It caught every single State Troopers in I-20 within 1.5 miles and even the ones that are hiding in the bushes . I love it but I wo n't trade my Valentine 1 for it because of the range comparison since Valentine one still trumps this V955 . Overall for the value and the features it is well worth it . Pros : Very minimal False alert -LRB- malls and certain places -RRB- Features Voice Alert -LRB- its a dude -RRB- Laser detection Price Cons : Nothing yet !! : -RRB- 	Radar Detector
This is a nice unit . The voice is not as clear as I would like . Otherwise it is working fine . 	Radar Detector
Very good value for the money ; very little falsing , sound reduces after initial contact so you do n't have a continuous , loud blaring . I have 4 other Bels and have always found them excellent . Some people mentioned glare from the chrome on top , but it does n't bother me so far . One point I would make is the plug is now like a telephone jack rather than the older , prong type so in the unlikely event it breaks , you can not use your older power wires . Hint : when the suction cups got old and do n't stick , they can be replace with the small ones sold in hobby shops ; just remove the wire hanger hook . Works great ! 	Radar Detector
My old Bel unit lasted forever and then would n't keep its programming . This new unit seemed good , but I got the dreaded `` service required '' message within two weeks . The message went away later , but I have no faith in the unit now and figure it will quit right outside the warranty period so ... back it goes . This unit seemed to sense everything pretty well and the auto mute is a nice feature . . -LRB- it never gets my neighborhood standing radar for some reason . -RRB- 	Radar Detector
I really can not say how this works , because except a few situation that I have had so far , there was not any more situation that I can test it . But , so far in my a few experiences , it works well , two of them in a highway and one situation at city . The only problem with this item is , false alarms that most of the time happen in city and urban area -LRB- because of automatic doors and etc. -RRB- , so you really do n't know that it is a police car or it is false , because you ca n't see police car in that crowed .

I am happy with the easy use of this unit , it has alerted me many times since I have been using it . If I needed a second unit I would buy the same product , 	Radar Detector
"Cobra a brand and name that is known for Radar Detectors . This is not my first Cobra porduct , I have the <ahref=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001TUYQT6/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/184-1095013-3029356""> Cobra XRS 9960G Voice Alert Radar\/Laser Detector </a> in one of my other vehicles . I thought I had the best `` high tech '' radar detector that was currently out in the market . I would of never expected Cobra to come out with another type of radar detector so soon that would be compatible with Apple products . Since I own an iPod Touch , I was eager to install and test out Cobra 's newest product in my other vehicle . The Cobra iRadar is fully functional with or without using an iPhone or iPod Touch . The main purpose of using the iPhone or iPod Touch is to see the visual alerts and control the settings . Otherwise , just using the iRadar by itself will give you audible alert and LED colored light alerts depending on what kind of signal it has picked up . Connecting your iPhone or iPod Touch is done by pairing under the bluetooth menus . There is no need to have a WiFi or Internet connection . The bluetooth pairing function allows the visual aspects of the iRadar to be viewed and controlled via the iPhone or iPod touch LED touch screen . First off , I was disappointed that the dash mount did not include a spot to attach my iPod Touch . It would have been nice if Cobra would of came up with a mount that would allow both products to be stationed next to each for easier visual purposes . I do n't have a mount for my iPod Touch so it made it quite difficult to try and place it somewhere where I could see the screen without it tipping over . I do have the option of buying a mount like the <ahref=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000MPIX3E/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/184-1095013-3029356""> Kensington Car Mount for iPod </a> , but I really do not like all kinds of electronics or cradles mounted all over my windshield and dash . I already have a GPS navigation system with power cord sitting on my dash and my cell phone and bluetooth 12V cables hanging around too . So for this reason I opted out on using the iRader with my iPod Touch . The purpose is to hear the alert go off instead of trying to view a picture while driving . I would rather keep my eyes on the road . So let me talk about the unit itself . It is sleek and quite small in size . Offers 360 degrees of protection . I prefer not to have anything mounted on my windshield , so I purchased another <ahref=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001DSIMAI/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/184-1095013-3029356""> Radar Detector Car Dash and Windshield Mount </a> to use with this unit . It sits on the mount securely with no vibrations . The higher the unit is position the better the reception and range , so make sure there are no obstructions such as front and rear window antennas in the way to give false signals . It does offer City\/Highway modes . In City mode lessens false alerts such as bank and municipality security alarms . It can tune out some of the false alarms , but not all . It also offers safety alerts such as approaching emergency vehicles or road hazards . Provides coverage on all bands including X-Band radar , K-Band radar , Ka-Band radar , VG-2 -LRB- detects vehicles with radar detectors -RRB- and POP Mode -LRB- POP radar gun sends a rapid transmission get a quick and accurate speed check without alerting approaching vehicle , but the speed can not be locked -RRB- . I think the time it picks up the signal could be better , seems to not have a quick detection in regards to the distance of the radar bands . Overall I consider this an OK radar detector for the price . I prefer the Cobra XRS 9960G over the iRadar model , but since this is a pretty new technology out in the market , I have faith the Cobra will do some tweaking and adjustments and come out with a new and improved iRadar in no time . "	Radar Detector
The BEL Vector 955 is better than I expected . There are very few false alarms and detection of radar or lazer is at least a mile or more . It has saved me already on two occasions since I received it 2 weeks ago . I would rate it near much more costly detectors . Amazon has once again come through with quick shipping and excellent value . I 'll be back ! 	Radar Detector
This 5-1 Auto Charger with 4 USB ports and 1 DC Socket is a very convenient piece of car attachment . Great to charge your cell phone , GPS , Bluetooth , etc. . 	Radar Detector
This is a great little product . For the price you pay for similar radar detectors easily goes up to $ 500 , you get all of the great features with this little device . You can use your phone with the device for all of the GPS capability , or you use the device without a phone and it works just fine . Great detection range , it tells me even if radar is behind me . Pros : Small Feature packed , GPS , Bluetooth , etc 360 degree detection iRadar app is easy to use and has many features Cons : Not battery operated , needs to be plugged in User reports pop up all the time , you can falsify them , but sometimes they go away before you can confirm or deny the report Summary : Great product , get it if you are looking for a radar detector , easily the best detector you can buy on the market hands down for under $ 499 	Radar Detector
This thing blew a fuse twice , even with nothing plugged into it , then we gave up on it . Maybe the quality control is lousy . 	Radar Detector
Ku band is in use in California . This unit lacks that detection . In addition , it is still prone to false Ka band readings -LRB- as are other Cobra 's -RRB- and , with the exception of iPod , you can not run other apps on the iPhone4 while using this . 	Radar Detector
does not seem to work very well on Ka-Band and Lazer as I have passed many police cars and speed traps without a beep but it works well on the K-Band . 	Radar Detector
Very pleased with this product . This is the second Beltronics I have purchased and like the first is a good value and I am happy with it . One thing you should be aware of is that it needs it 's own power supply from the vehicle . Putting it on a splitter i.e. with another device -LRB- GPS , mp3 player , etc. -RRB- will cause it to give a service required warning . I learned this from Beltronics customer service department . 	Radar Detector
nice design & easy to use and the additional 12v 2 way adapter is nice no tickets so i guess its working !! 	Radar Detector
I purchased this detector as it seemed like a great deal for the price . It did actually perform fairly well , I never had a problem with it detecting , only issue is the display . As others have mentioned , the display is very hard to read during the day , especially in sunlight . 	Radar Detector
Good product . Gives a fair warning of police radar presence . Wish it gave a better warning in some cases though . The reaction time in a few cases was mere seconds but usually this is not the case . I like the programmable features and they 're easy to use and the detector remembers them after you turn it off and on again . I bought this after seeing that it was considered the ` best under $ 200 radar ' by more than a few sources . I found mine on Amazon for $ 50 dollars cheaper than a lot of the other bigger sites . I paid $ 153 total to get it to my door . Detects on all the bands used to catch speeders . Now I need a laser jammer . 	Radar Detector
Received the mount a few days ago but was unable to try it out until today . The suction cups are a little bit bigger than the OEM but work great . Did not fall or slip once and served it purpose . I recommend this product to anybody looking for a replacement bracket ! 	Radar Detector
I am gonna be short here , I bought this Beltronic about 8-9 months ago . This is my first radar detector and this is the best device I have ever bought in my life , this is an everybody must have in the car . I do n't mean I wanna be racing around , but unfortunately speed tickets have become in a millionaire industry in the whole country so I do n't want to contribute with my money to the most of the time arbitrary practice . I have the detector set it up in highway , I never disconnect it from the car power outlet . I start the car and turn it off and never touch the Beltronic . So far so good , excellent ! and many , many times I have known in advance where are the hidden police cars or the unmarked ones `` servicing '' the community . 	Radar Detector
Does get a good amount of false alarms but in City mode it will automatically mute X-alerts -LRB- That is the ONLY reason for 4-stars on accuracy -RRB- . Picks up radar signals from a very good distance away and I have not had any issues with it at all . Overall , VERY satisfied ! Works perfectly and does not cost as much as some other detector . 	Radar Detector
This is my 2nd Beltronic radar detector . I ended up giving my 1st one to my wife !! She absolutely had to have it since she does a lot of travel . This device has NEVER been wrong . It is absolutely fantastic in giving you plenty of warning in advance about the radar coming at you in all directions . I ca n't say enough about this device . The manual is a must read since it explains the various types of signals -LRB- banks , city driving versus highway , etc -RRB- . I will probably own one of these as long as I can drive . 	Radar Detector
I have had several detectors but this one picks up radar siginals before you can find the police . The only draw back to this unit is that it does not have a automatic shut off . 	Radar Detector
Very good product . It gives a warning of upcoming radar signals from a very good distance away , before I can even see where the signal is coming from . Highly recommended . 	Radar Detector
I would recommend this product , it work very good and comes in a great travel case . I would suggest that you determine your instalation before ordering , direct wire harness extra . 	Radar Detector
I purchased this detector because my previous one was not picking up laser signals anymore . This detector seems cheaper and has more false alarms than my old cobra model -LRB- which was much less expensive -RRB- . While this detector does pick up laser radar , it does not pick up KA or K bands as quickly as the cobra model did . Pros : Laser detection Voice alerts Cons : Annoying tones More false alarms More expensive . I would probably purchase another Cobra detector in the future and avoid this Beltronics model . 	Radar Detector
Its been about 2 months now since I purchased this and I have never been disappointed since then . It picks up all bands as described and lets me know of cops with `` ON '' radar guns wayyyyy before they are in visual . I have never missed a cop-car after installation . I have never regretted purchasing this detector especially when I KNOW that I got the best that there is in the market . LASER : The unit will alarm you no matter what kind of laser beam it detects in 360 degrees , and often it is not from some cop , but from some modern cars , or private home\/shop alarm systems . X , K , Ka Band : Surprisingly , even in city mode , where it is supposed to cut-out innocent store alarm systems -LRB- like kroger , walmart , gas-stations -RRB- , it always chirps\/alarms , which can get irritating if you pass through the same route everyday . The only practical problem , and it is not any Radar Detector 's fault ; is that if some cops choose to keep their radar guns off , then it ca n't detect such cars , which happens in my area very often -LRB- mine is a relatively small town with easy going life compared to Houston nearby where most cops have their guns ON most of the time -RRB- .

There are many different products on the market in this area but Escort rules the roost . I believe it will do the job it 's asked to do . Just watch out for the Laser . If your detector pops up `` Laser '' its to late . lol 	Radar Detector
I purchased a radar detector for my husband for Christmas and he returned it because it was n't the one he wanted . The seller is claiming that a unicycle seat was sent back -LRB- we do n't even have a unicycle seat ! -RRB- . I contacted the seller and they are now claiming it must have been the Post Office . No , the package weighted 2 lbs 5 oz . -LRB- weight of the radar detector -RRB- . Then , I checked the site from Amazon , and noticed that I had given them a 5 star rating and ` Great Seller ! ' feedback . YEAH , RIGHT !!! It appears that their system provides automatic feedback after each order ... that 's why their ratings are so good . Anyway , beware of this site ! I 'm serious ... something 's not right with this company and I may have lost $ 247.00 !!!!!! 	Radar Detector
So far so good . Even though I do not drive at speeds that would normally require a radar detector , it is great to see those who are out to get you . It was n't until the law enforcement communities of Nevada and Utah started to use undercover vehicles and setting up speed traps to increase revenues that I found it necessary to buy the Vector V995 . So far so good , I have found it to be a very useful tool . It would be nice if the P.D. started to be more concerned in protecting the public instead of getting the public ... 	Radar Detector
I am very pleased wth this item , it has already saved me from a couple of citations , make sure you are in a state that lets you attach it to your windshield in calif. you can not use that method . 	Radar Detector
The product appears to warn me about many sources of radar in my area - hospitals , etc. . I had this product a week and was on the freeway traveling with the speed of the traffic and I received a $ 300.00 speeding ticket with no warning from the detector . I have gone back to my old way - personally scanning the horizon for police radar . I seem to be more reliable . 	Radar Detector
I got the models and the reveiws mixed up , thought I wanted the 995 but actually wanted the 65 cause it had better laser results . Radar detection on the 995 is great , with plenty of warning time . I do n't know about the laser detection because it has not sounded off yet . 	Radar Detector
This is a very good radar detector : the best . Covers alot of area and alerts you well ahead of the police radar . unit is pretty heavy ; requires the extra heavy duty dash\/windshield mount which is not provided in the kit . the suction cups in the kit are too small to hold the detector level at the windshield . 	Radar Detector
Unit has very useable features and is simple to use . Tones are a little annoying , but maybe this is a good thing . Memory function and volume control are very useful . Detection seems to be good . Lot 's of false alarms due to sensitvity being so high . This is a given trade off . Voice is easy to understand . Automute is a very nice feature in congested areas . 	Radar Detector

Seriously logitech ... could you have designed a worse peice of junk software to control this remote ??? The software to setup the remote is complete tripe . I would compare it to iTunes . IT 'S JUNK ! It 's slow . It 's hard to use . You 'll be sitting in front of the computer for hours waiting for your remote to be perfect . I could go on for hours but I do n't want to waste your time , so I 'll just point out the junk features . The software is slow . I 'm not sure what it 's doing between lags but it 's at least a couple of seconds between button clicks . The software is a stand-alone wizard based program . So you 'll have to answer a bunch of multiple choice questions just to get to where you want to go . A web based app would have been more appropriate for this internet based remote since it pulls the control settings from the internet . Every time you update your remote from the software it overrides your manually settings . So you 'll have to readjust the remote using the help button . This happens EVERY damn time you click `` update remote '' which is quite often . This remote\/software package is not a setup once deal . you 'll have to come back to the software often for it to be perfect . This will literally take hours due to the poor design of the software and it 's overriding of all manually set controls . DO NOT PURCHASE THIS POS ! 	Remote Control

I have the SKYFI2 hooked up to my home stereo and am impressed with how easy it was to get it working . While the sound is n't CD quality I was n't expecting it to be . It 's on a par with FM but the music choices are 1000x better . XM has great music channels and I have n't listened to the radio at home since I bought this . I like the display and the artist and song titles . The remote works great and the FM modulation works well even in the crowded Washington DC airwaves .

Since I did n't want to fork out $ 400 for a new Harmony remote with RF capabilities , I decided to purchase this RF remote control extender after reading the reviews . It works better than I expected . It 's wonderful to be able to mute and fast forward from my kitchen while watching the TV housed in my family room . However , I have noticed that I have to push buttons more than once at times . Also the battery capacity is not great . The idea of it recharging the battery in the deviceis a good one , but does n't work very well . About every 5 or 6 days , I recharge it in a stand alone battery recharger , which works better . All in all it 's absolutely worth buying . 	Remote Control
I love it ! . Very Easy to set-up . Updating it once every 2-3 weeks does seem to help resolve issues . Set-up is done by going to Logitech site and creating a profile under your user-name . From ther-on it installs the Client Software on your machine and updates the remote when you need . Also , Logitech just changed its Setup Web Site with a new front-end interface with Colorful Buttons that invoke different Actions which is far better than 1 month ago . The old set-up screens were very confusing . Overall , I still love it ! . 	Remote Control
Overall I like this product for its combination of price and functionality . I do agree with the issues others have mentioned about the keyboard buttons being too stiff , the mouse being inaccurate , and the range of the IR . You do get used to these drawbacks . I use mine for a media-center remote and some internet browsing . If the keyboard and mouse was better I would use it for some gaming as well -LRB- It would be great for RTS 's and RPGs ' -RRB- . I like the overall feel and size . It reminds me of an xbox controller in size and feel . If the they could fix the problems , even if it added $ 20 to the price , it would be a great product . I would recommend it to someone as long as they understood the shortcomings . 	Remote Control

It is unfortunate that there is not an option of a rating of `` zero stars '' . This is very likely the worst piece of gear that I can remember ever buying . I did not get around to starting to program the Harmony unit until about one week ago . Well it still is n't programmed primarily because the unit can not hold a charge long enough and the software does nothing but tell me that it can not get an internet connection . Besides these major points I think this 890 is truly a piece of junk . This is due to many things not the least of which in my case are : The programming problems , The failure to hold a charge , The build quality is incredibly poor , The buttons are too small and very unresponsive , Despite Logitech 's promises to the contrary this unit does not work with my lighting system -LRB- I checked with them before buying -RRB- , It does not work with my DVDO unit which is an important unit in my setup , You need great eyesight to even hope to read the functions on the buttons , I do n't have enough years left to live to sit on hold with the ironically named Logitech Customer Care people -LRB- only to be told the same thing I can read off the internet -RRB- or the days and days it takes them to respond to an email .

Bought the L5 Remote for my iPad and was impressed right off the bat with how easy it was to program the TV and the receiver , but to my dismay I was not able to program my Cable Box since it is a pretty generic box \/ remote . However , I posted my issue on the L5 Forum and an administrator promptly responded and they custom created a remote for me that I was able to easily download . Now I can control all my devices on my iPad with ease . It 's pretty cool . 	Remote Control

Cuando lleg&oacute; el env&iacute;o me sorprendi&oacute; lo compacto y bien construido del art&iacute;culo . Su funci&oacute;n es bastante simple , funciona a trav&eacute;s de un infrarrojo que tiene un alcance m&aacute;s que suficiente desde varios &aacute;ngulos . Permite enfocar -LRB- modo AF -RRB- y luego tomar la fotograf&iacute;a . Incluye una peque & ntilde ; a funda con velcro que se puede adjuntar a la correa de la c&aacute;mara para f&aacute;cil acceso . Honestamente , no me parece un accesorio imprescindible y definitivamente es muy b&aacute;sico comparado con otros remotos disponibles en el mercado , sin embargo te dar&aacute; la libertad que no da el temporizador para fotos grupales o cuando quieras tomar una foto sin el m&aacute;s m&iacute;nimo movimiento .

I set up a mini-home theater with a panasonic digital projector , sony dvd and onkyo 7.1 amp\/rec . Surprisingly , none of these remotes allowed use in the dark . The Harmony 550 works perfectly for what we wanted . Using the computer to program how I want to use it was intuitive and very simple . Programing allows for one-touch turn-on of all devices for a particular activity , like watching a movie via the projector or even playing x-box on the big screen . Of course all essential functions for a particular activity can be easily controlled with the Harmony ... and especially in the dark . The promotional info is accurate so get the details from there . In short I am very pleased with this purchase . 	Remote Control
This is the only way to trigger a D90 remotely . The quality of the product is superior . Simply take is out of the package , activate the included battery and you are ready to go .

I am using the Next Generation Remote Extender -LRB- plus extra battery\/transmitter -RRB- to control a Directv remote and Pioneer Elite DVD player located in a bedroom closet . There are 3 closet\/bathroom walls between the living room and the location of the `` flying saucer '' base station . There is a slight time lag but so far the system has worked flawlessly . No programming required ! I did have a Universal programmable remote with rf blaster -LRB- which has now been recycled -RRB- and was a pain to program . 	Remote Control
This is a great remote and was easy to set up . I think they should make the remote with a soft rubber outer shell so it does n't slip around while using . The buttons are to small and at times you have to use both hands to use some of the functions . I would buy another for my other video room . 	Remote Control
I received the item in a very protected package , and in a very good condition . It works well when I open DvD player which comes with mac . Nevertheless , the menu boton does not work with any other player . Also if you do not open dvd player the menu boton does not do anything . With itunes it is the same , menu does not do anything . I think it is a problem with OS X Lion because with previous OS it opens a menu even if you did not open any software before . Since i wanted for Power Point presentations and volume issues , it works well for me , but possible you want it for more than that . 	Remote Control
This is an awesome remote for $ 6 and free shipping . Are you kidding the dang thing glows in the dark for goodness and changes the channel and volume . A flawless working remote with large buttons that does what remotes are designed to do . 	Remote Control
This remote includes many pre-set remote layouts and has a learning feature . The buttons are well laid out and the overall remote feels comfortable in the hand . However , this remote does have some quarks and limitations . Most of the presets are very limited , containing only the most common buttons -LRB- volume , power , etc -RRB- . As such , this remote with the presets alone will not fully replace an existing remote . The more esoteric buttons will have to be learned from the original remote . Likewise , the presets are not all inclusive . This remote only had the presets for one of the three devices I wanted to replace . Using every alternative method described in the manual , I never was able to find any preset that would work with those other two devices . The only remaining option available was to use the learning feature . Since one is going to program dozens of buttons into this new remote , it helps to have a plan before starting . My solution was to create a spreadsheet listing each of the buttons on the new remote . Afterwards , I studied each of the old remotes to determine which button would be programmed into which button on the new remote , listing each button in the spreadsheet as I went along beside the selected button on the new remote . To make the remote easier to use later , I tried to stay consistent between the various devices , with similar functions programmed into the same buttons -LRB- the menu buttons for the four devices into same button on the new remote , the door\/tray buttons into the same button , and so on -RRB- . When I finished , I finally started programming the new remote . The learning feature was much more combersome to program than I expected . It required a precise sequence of buttons , with only five seconds allowed between keystrokes . It often took longer than five seconds to refer to the manual or my notes to find the proper buttons to press . Anyway , if you miss a keystroke , or delay longer than five seconds , the entire sequence has to be started again from the beginning . Also the learning feature memory is limited to only 50 to 70 buttons -LRB- small print in the manual -RRB- , which is not a lot considering many remotes today have twenty , thirty , or more , buttons . Since presets seem to use a separate memory area , you can conserve learning memory by always using whatever preset is available for your device . Of course , not all devices will have a preset available , or will have a preset with all the features desired . However , try several presets until you find one offering the most features used by your device . At that point , your remote only has to learn the other buttons . Another memory saving technique is to always hold the button down on the original remote while learning . The gives the learning remote time to study the signal to obtain the number sequence instead of just recording the signal . The three or four digit number sequence requires far less memory than a recorded signal . Finally , if a button is n't in the location you prefer , copy the sequence from the old button instead of learning . In the end , using careful memory management , I was able to fully program four full remotes into this one remote without running out of memory . However , if the memory limit mentioned in the manual is indeed accurate , I seriously doubt anyone could program eight remotes into this one . Anyway , with all that finally out of the way -LRB- and the spreadsheet printed to help me remember the buttons -RRB- , this remote is now a real pleasure to use . Unlike the original remotes -LRB- now in a drawer -RRB- , the buttons on this remote are laid out exactly as I want them . And , since the memory is retained while changing batteries , I probably wo n't have to program any more buttons until a new device is purchased or this remote wears out -LRB- seems fairly well built , so not a major concern -RRB- . I 'm going to knock off a star for the learning limit not disclosed on the box -LRB- or in advertising I 've seen -RRB- and the combersome learning process , but will give this item an overall positive rating . After all , the price is very hard to beat . 	Remote Control
Works as expected and I have another one set to a different house code . We use this one mostly to trigger a chime so I can be `` called '' if I am playing Xbox games in the soundproof theater room ! If using these controllers and you have a larger house you will also need a device to route the signals to both legs of you main circuit box . there is also one of the link devices that plugs into your 210VAC outlet to be able to signal across bot legs .

I bought this to replace a Phillips learning remote . The remote dose learn some things but if you enter in the channel you want it will not be able to use the enter button because it is only able to be used on Sony TVs not a big deal to me . I mainly got this for my Sony Receiver because it has more functions to use and the Phillips just would n't do . I can use this remote on my IPOD dock with my Sony Receiver . This remote will not learn any of the functions of a Recordable DVD player like going to set up finishing a disc which is a good if you have little ones who like to play with remotes . If your looking to up grade your remote this on is not bad if you do n't mind its limits in learning which I do n't mind because it does do the basic functions which is turn the items I want on and off and play .

I did a lot of research before purchasing my unit , including talking to a company tech support person , who responded promptly and was very helpful . I was able to set it up with 6 components in a closed cabinet in 20 minutes . I put the sensor in the cabinet behind speaker grill cloth below my Pioneer Elite 60 '' plasma TV . I have had no problems whatsoever with IR interference . Works great with my Logitech Harmony One universal remote . 	Remote Control
Bought one ... died approx 1 year later , got another one and ... it died approx 1 year later . Same reason as most others , it stops charging in the cradle - wo n't make contact .

I mounted a TV on the wall in my bedroom . I bought this product so I could hide my DVR behind the TV and be able to switch channels . It worked , but extremely SLOW ! It also required me to have to aim the remote EXACTLY at the device . There are several settings on this . I have tried all , but it may work better once I try to adjust it to the exact setting . So far , I am not impressed . I have relatives that have this same item and it works perfectly for their set up . 	Remote Control
So far this has been working very well . I have used it for over 1 week now and it is better than the Griffin iTrip that I have for another iPhone . Less static and less cables to worry about . I have n't used the remote yet , but I am very satisfied . 	Remote Control
Love this device . Only 1 issue ; it takes 5-10 seconds for the remote to complete communication with the marco , so you have to wait until the Harmony is talking with all the devices . Over-all ; I think its great . 	Remote Control
Although it takes a little ` tweaking ' to get it just right -- it is well worth it . It replaces all your other remotes completely . I highly recommend . 	Remote Control
First note that the 880 I bought was from the refurbished listing here on Amazon , but my review should still apply here to the brand new 880 . -- The Harmony could not have a more apt name , it brings harmony to your entire home entertainment system . In my case 6 remotes are now tucked away in the drawer and only the Harmony remains to control it all . The best part of the Harmony is not that it simply replaces the remotes you already have , after all any simple budget universal remote -LRB- that costs a fair amount less -RRB- can do that . Where the Harmony exceeds it that it is an intelligent remote . Yes it will act as a bridge to replace all your other remotes , but the Harmony is smarter than even that -- it brings interaction between all the remotes . Through setting up of activities , you simply need to press a single button on the Harmony and it will do every single command action necessary to bring up the viewing mode that you desire to do -- Press `` watch TiVo '' for example and the Harmony will turn on your TV if it is off , will cycle the TV to the correct input , turn on the TiVo if necessary , turn on a audio receiver if necessary , set the audio receiver to the input it needs to be on , and though that may sound complicated as you think of all the steps -- it 's all automated , to you it 's just a button press away . Then if you tire of watching live TV and want to watch say a DVD , press your watch DVD activity and the harmony will change the input on the TV to what it needs to be , turn off the tivo -LRB- If you 've set it to do so -RRB- , switch the audio receiver input as need be , turn on the DVD player , and -LRB- if you set it up to do so -RRB- even eject the dvd tray for you so you just need to walk over put something in and retract the tray . And it 's not hard at all to set this up : simply attach the Harmony via the included USB cable to your computer , fire up the Harmony software , and the software will guide you through setting up your entire home entertainment center , all you need to know is the make and model of all your components . The software will search it 's massive online database of devices , download the configuration , and set up most everything automatically for you . I did not run into a single device that the Harmony software did n't have database info for , and that included a 10 year old VCR . Do n't like how the software pre-configured the remote layout for one of your devices , or the way it goes about activating an activity ? No problem , the software lets you fine tune and adjust every little action that you can think of . You can change the assignment of commands to any of the Harmony 's hard buttons , and you can configure the `` soft buttons '' -LRB- the commands that show up on the LCD -RRB- to whatever you like , rearrange them as you like -- whatever . It 's brilliant . There 's nothing really to say short of that this device was thought out -- and thought out well . It can handle most any different ways that your devices do things . -LRB- for example it has different modes for chaning inputs on the TV , use the one that your TV 's included remote uses . Does your TV have direct buttons to each input ? Harmony can control that . Does it have one button that cycles through the inputs ? Harmony can control that too , and it always remembers the input it left the TV on for the next time you choose an activity to switch inputs -RRB- . The versatility is astounding . If you like tweaking , you 'll love this remote . Yes you can have it up in running in 10 minutes about if you 're happy with all the default configuration -- but if you want to tweak so it 's exactly how you want it -- you may end up spending additional hours getting everything just right . But the great thing is that you CAN get it jsut right , it is fully customizable . What the harmony does not have hard buttons for , can be set up in the LCD soft buttons . The LCD is a small rectangular color screen , with four buttons on each side -LRB- for a total of 8 -RRB- . When you switch to an activity or a device it switches the screen to the soft buttons you set up for that activity or device . one command enxt to each button , for a total of 8 commands per page . But do n't worry if you have more , because there are previous page and next page buttons on the harmony that let you scroll through more pages of commands if you have that many you want to use . The 880 has a built in motion gyroscope . The Harmony turns off the LCD after a few seconds of non-use to conserve batteries . But the gyroscope allows the remote to detect when it 's been lifted and tilted , meaning that everytime you pick up the remote , if the screen is off , it will instantly light up just for you . -LRB- But do n't worry , if that does n't sound appealing to you , you can turn this feature off in the software just like anything else ! There 's a `` glow '' button that can be pressed to manually light the screen in that case -RRB- The 880 has the advantage of coming with a included base station\/cradle . When you place the 880 in its cradle , it automatically begins to recharge the battery . The base station is a nice looking horizontal cradle , with a depression that is molded to fit the entire horizontal bottom of the remote . The cradle also has a round Logitech logo in the middle of it , which is surrounded by a translucent plastic ring which glows blue when the cradle has been attached to the AC adapter , so you know that it has power . Placing the 880 in the cradle is no harder than simply laying it down horizontally upon the cradle -LRB- so the LCD and button side of the remote is up -RRB- . That 's it . If you 're wondering if the Harmony has support for controlling your device -- ask yourself this : Is the original remote for the device infared ? If the answer is yes , then the answer is that most probably to the point of definitely the Harmony supports it . It most likely will be in the Logitech software database , but even if it is not , the Harmony is also a learning remote -- it has a IR receiver on the bottom of the remote . If there is no pre-existing configuration for your device in the database , you can simply go through a wizard for having the Harmony learn all your original remotes commands . That process only involves aligning the front of your original remote with the sensor on the bottom of the Harmony , and pressing the appropriate buttons and clicking through wizard on the Harmony 's website . Be wary of devices that use RF for their remotes , as the 880 does not have the ability to control RF -- not without help . Some devices such as home environmental systems have optional devices you can purchase that will accept IR commands -LRB- from the Harmony for example -RRB- and then the device will translate that into RF commands . That would be an additional purchase of course , but it 's worth looking into if you find yourself in that situation . I can not speak any more highly about Logitech 's customer support . I had to contact them on a couple issues , and my experience was a great joy . One was a configuration issue , which was that my TV simply did something in a certain way that is out of the usual and not easily setup through the Harmony software -LRB- I believe this was really a fluke case though -RRB- . I contact Logitech about this problem and within a couple of days a very courteous and helpful technician responded saying that they had altered my Harmony setup online to rectify the problem , and to simply reconnect my remote and update it , and it should work properly now . Which I did . And it worked first go ! The other issue I has was that in my package from Amazon I received the wrong USB cable . . I believe this was also a major fluke . Logitech not only agreed to send me a replacement USB cable , but they did it no questions asked , and free of charge , and I received it about a week later . Great company -- great product . There is only one thing you probably should be mindful of with the 880 , which is that there are two versions of the cradle . The original cradles had a known problem that made charging very difficult and inconsistent -LRB- As in the remote would not charge most of the time as it did n't make proper contact -RRB- . Logitech released a revised cradle that solved this problem . I 've had no problems charging , so I believe I received the new one . If you do have problems -- please do n't give up . First try cleaning the charging contacts on the cradle and remote with a small amount of rubbing alcohol , if that does n't help , then get in touch with Logitech right away ! They 'll make it right and send you a new cradle right away . -LRB- I 've read about this problem on a few message forums , and in all cases Logitech always took care of it -RRB- . So it goes without saying I highly recommend this remote . I balked at first too about paying so much for a remote , but I could n't be happier with my decision to give it a try . Once you use the Harmony you realize it is so much more than a regular universal remote -- it really should n't even be compared with the run of the mill average universal remotes . If you 're in the market for unifying your home theater experience , or if you simply just want to retire a mess of remotes that you have to juggle , give this remote a very serious consideration , I think it 'd be hard to be displeased .

The Next Generation Remote Control Extender works \* exactly \* as advertised . It 's an extremely clever idea , and no surprise that it claims to hold a number of patents . Setting it up could not be simpler : Just replace one of the batteries -LRB- either AAA or AA -RRB- in your remote with the supplied battery\/transmitter , position the receiver in view of the equipment to be controlled -LRB- or use the included `` eye '' , if required -RRB- and you 're in business . I 'm using it with a TiVO HD and the standard TiVO remote control , at a distance of about 50 feet . It 's room-to-room , so I do n't have line-of-sight , and the RF transmitter\/receiver works perfectly , repeatably , and accurately . I 've used other `` remote extenders '' with poor results , and a lot of frustration . In short , for $ 50 , the value ca n't be beat - it 's well worth the price . I highly recommend it . If you need a simple-to-install , reliable , remote control that works with your EXISTING remote and above all , WORKS , then this is the one . 	Remote Control
This is much cheaper than a stand alone universal remote , and does more . Using the touch screen for a remote takes a little getting used to , like it did for the phone , but not bad . The benefits definitely outweigh the disadvantages . I also like the idea of having a backup for my remotes because I 've had a few stop working or disappear . 	Remote Control
serves purpose . Only problem is with the line of sight . But I was aware of it before buying and perfectly ok with it . 	Remote Control
I got the Harmony 550 to control my Samsung LCD TV , HD TiVo , and Samsung Blu-Ray player . All of this equipment is brand new and supported by the Harmony 550 remote . After some initial setup frustrations , I 'm happy to report I 've been using the Harmony 550 for four days now without issue on any of my components . Perhaps more importantly , the remote allows my wife to easily control all of our new equipment without having to really learn anything about how it is all set up . Setting up the remote was not as intuitive as it really should have been . I 'm computer savvy and was helped by being able to understand what it was the software was trying to coax out of me or the original remotes at every step . The software is easy enough to use , but the process it takes you through seems a bit cumbersome . It tries to guess at all of the activities you want given all of your components , butI think this step probably hurts more than it helps . I 'd rather just start with a clean slate of activities that I select myself . In my first two attempts , I was unable to create a `` Listen to Music '' activity that did n't also want to turn the TV on . This should be simple to do , and I imagine it 's possible , but I was n't able to easily and quickly figure it out . The default mappings for my devices were pretty sufficient . I changed a few of them on the TiVo HD -LRB- most notably moving thumbs up and thumbs down to the up and down arrows - their logical location -RRB- . I shuffled any of the controls that were relegated to the LCD so that the ones I use most often are on the first page . I still have a bit of shuffling I 'd like to do , but all of the critical functions are covered . Using the remote is a breeze . I do n't have to worry about what input my equipment is hooked up to . I do n't have to worry about which control handles the volume for my Blu-Ray player . I have n't had to use the `` Help '' button once . My TV supports discrete IR codes - remote codes that tell it `` power on '' and `` power off '' instead of simply `` toggle power . '' The same goes for switching inputs - my TV can be told `` switch to HDMI2 '' rather than having to scroll through each input to get there . When using a remote like the Harmony , this leads to fewer sync issues . The Harmony will work if it has only toggle and cycle controls but you may find yourself using the `` Help '' button a bit more to synchronize components . I have a few minor gripes with the remote itself . It 's difficult at first to distinguish between the respective channel and volume controls as they are flush with the face of the remote and have no space between them . Those buttons , along with the navigational circle and the `` OK '' button , are a little loud when pressed . They give off an audible click noise that I really wish they did n't . The other buttons are as quiet as they should be , though . Overall , the remote gets 4 stars . Setting it up is more complicated than it really should be and may lead to a bit of frustration , but this is a one time thing for most users . Once setup the remote works wonderfully and indistinguishably from the original remotes . 	Remote Control
So this wired control for a DSLR , and in my case the Nikon D3100 , is a great third-party option for people who do n't want to spend full price for the first-party product . Pros + Does everything the Nikon wired remote can do , but for -LRB- ATW \* -RRB- a third of the price + It 's freaking -LRB- ATW \* -RRB- $ 10 + It has a great big handle , so you can grip it with confidence + The wire is pretty strong for something being only $ 10 -LRB- ATW \* -RRB- Cons - It 's build type reflects the price , it 's cheap plastic with a cheap connector . but the wiring is surprisingly strong -LRB- as noted above -RRB- - If the camera is turned on and you plug in this wired remote , the camera wo n't realize it 's there . you have to turn the camera off and then back on for it to work -LRB- not a deal breaker but a minor annoyance -RRB- overall it 's a great product , except for a couple things , but honestly you can buy three of these and still would n't cost as much as one of the nikon versions . i 'd say a definite buy the photographer on a budget \* ATW stands for at the time of this writing \* 	Remote Control

Any OPtoma Pico PK201 projector owners need to own this . The remote does almost everything . I say `` almost '' because it operates every funtion of the projector , minus turning it on . The remote will turn off the projector , but you still have to turn on the projector from the unit itself . That being said , very OTHER function is fully controlled . It changes the brightness setting , changes source input , mutes the sound , changes the volume , and has a directional pad to navigate the onboard menu . I use the projector with the Wii , my HD video camcorder , my Iphone , and digital camera . The remote is amazing . Buy it and you wo n't be sad . I gave it 4 stars because of the lack of the power on function . Truly , it should be 4.99 stars . It 's near perfect for what it does . 	Remote Control

"I happened to come across this remote again on Amazon.com and amazon.com pop-up tells me that I bought this exact remote over a year ago . I thought I should write a review even though it already has so many good reviews . After using it for over a year , this is still my primary home theater control device . It works well and controls all my equipments nicely . Logitech updates the software to keep up with new equipments . I recently bought a new DVD player <ahref=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000UIA6YM/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/176-5427121-6803338""> OPPO DV-980H 1080p Up-Converting Universal DVD Player with HDMI and 7.1 CH Audio </a> , a new TV -LRB- Pioneer PDP-5010FD -RRB- and Logitech already has the remote code support for them . For codes that are not included by Logitec -LRB- such as the Zone 2 control codes for my Onkyo TX-SR604 receiver -RRB- , it can be easily captured using the Harmony 's learning feature . The only things in my home theater the Harmony can not control is the Sony playstation 3 . The PS3 uses a Bluetooth remote , not an infrared remote . The only drawback of the Harmony 659 is that it consumes the 4 AAA batteries quickly . However consider its functions and ease of use , I still give it a 5-star rating . "	Remote Control

I purchased this remote when my Harmony 680 fell into the pets water bowl . The upgrade was near flawless . A quick call to customer service solved the minor problem I had with one button being mapped to two different devices . Customer service was able to `` remotely '' -LRB- no pun intended -RRB- solve the problem . Battery life seems reasonable . My only complaint is with the `` motion sensor '' inside the remote . When sitting idle , the remote turns off the LED screen . When you grab the remote , it turns it on . If you set the remote on a sofa , any movement turns the screen on for the preset time . The motion sensor can be deactivated totally , but it is generally a handy feature . 	Remote Control
I bought one , it would n't charge , then bought another , and it charges some of the time . Setup was n't too bad , a little buggy but if you spend a little time on it it will work . Once set up , it worked like a charm . But the charging is horrible . I read the reviews and bought anyway , which was a mistake . Once in the cradle , it will charge for about 5 minutes , then it stops , it 's madening !!!! If you could use normal batteries , I rate this higher . Save your money until Logitech does better QA .

I do n't review products ... normally . But , this is a remarkably clever product ; and it really works ... as advertised . It was opened and up and running in less than 5 minutes without having to read directions . I could not be happier . The hardest thing about setting it up was getting it out of the plastic package . : - -RRB- Too early to comment on some product categories like Unit Life ; but my first impressions could not be better .

If you want vibration free tripod shots , this remote is a MUST . As most photographers know , tripping the shutter on a tripod mounted camera can produce unwanted vibrations . With this remote , that is no longer a problem . Set the camera for a 10 second release , press the remote button from in front of the camera and just walk out of the field of view . For those Blue Hour photographers with a Nikon DSLR , this will be your best friend . 	Remote Control
I have a Dell Inspiron laptop , with Win XP . Installed with absolutely no issues , and the quality of the recordings exceeded my expectations , given the mixed reviews . I have n't used the product to record television ... just for converting my older home movies . It records directly to mpeg , then I re-encode using divx to cut down on the file sizes . I 'm very pleased with the results . Reading the other reviews , there seems to be some driver issues that I did not personally experience . I think for the price , it 's worth it to give this product a chance . Read the directions before plugging it in , etc. , etc. . . 	Remote Control
I love this remote . It was easy to set up and it is relatively easy to use . I certainly love the fact that all my equipment -LRB- tv , dvd , xbox , etc. -RRB- all works with full functionality with this remote . For me , this remote works great . I will state though , there are flaws . First of all , the cradle for the remote is not ideal for being sure you have perfect contact with the power tips . Also , this remote is NOT ideal for someone who is buying this for an older person . You still have to work your way around it , especially when you have multiple components hooked up to it . Its buttons are smallish and could be difficult for those people who need larger buttons . As for the software , I just went straight to the website and downloaded the most up to date software they had . I did n't even take the cd-rom out of the package . One beef , it is minor , that I have with this unit is why ca n't it have a find function on its cradle in case you have misplaced the remote . I mean , cheap hand help phones have this feature , why not an expensive remote as well ? Overall , I would recommend this unit to anyone trying to consolidate their remotes . I will also say , I am happy I waited for the price of this model to drop to make it more appealing to purchase . Hope this helps . 	Remote Control

"I found this remote so difficult to program that 1 year after purchase , I still do n't use it . If you are techie type , you would probably have no problems . I am not . I did a lot of research before purchasing this and was pretty soundly the best on the market . That is why I chose it . Some day I will sell it on the internet . It will be like new . Actually , I just sold this on Craigslist . Hey , I am 63 and this was too much for non-technologist generation . <ahref=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00093IIRA/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/192-0324385-8043626""> Logitech Harmony 880 Advanced Universal Remote Control </a> "	Remote Control
Easy to use - just plug in and go . I use this : on my motorcycle - I used the holder and velcro strap included - attached it to my handlebars . With the large buttons it is easy to control the ipod even with gloves on . In my house - I use it to control my ipod attached to my stereo . Only drawback - they say it works up to 60 feet - seems to only work up to about 30 feet away . 	Remote Control
I got these specifically to use with the Men 's Scottevest Travel Vest . The standard iPhone headset as well as two other sets of earbuds I had already had too short of a cord between the split and the buds themselves making them too short and too tight to allow movement of my head despite there being a good foot or more of cord coiled up in the pocket where the phone lives . These give good range , at least on the XL version of the vest and have the bonus of being black and blending in with the fabric nicely . I nicked the \* 's on the sound quality and isolation just because they are not quite as good as the Shure E2C 's or larger over the ear headphones . This does not mean I feel these are not excellent headphones though . The quality is good and require far less than max volume to attain good isolation from the environment . The headset feature works nicely , clear sound on both ends of the phone . The in-line remote ends up at a perfect spot right along the lapel once wired into the Travel Vest . Taking advantage of the internal wiring capabilities keep cords well out of the way . Highly recommended if you 're looking for a set of ear buds compatible with the Men 's Scottevest Travel Vest -LRB- Disclaimer : Yes , I know how geeky the vest is and yes , I love it despite\/because of it . -RRB- 	Remote Control
I recently upgraded my TV to a Sony NX800 . I have a Sony BluRay DVD , DirecTV and TiVo . I can get any of the remotes to work 2 devices but I could n't get away from a coffee table with remotes . This Sony remote worked out of the package with my TV and my Bluray player . It comes with a COMPLETE list of codes for any device -LRB- warning have a magnifier if you are over 40 and wear reading glasses -RRB- . The programming is sraightforward and took about 15 minutes to find the correct codes for the TiVo -LRB- 20618 TiVo 2 -RRB- and the DirecTV HD satellite receiver -LRB- 41377 -RRB- . Ten minutes of patient instruction with my wife and now no remote clutter . One remote that works all the devices with all the features . The manual that comes with the device is thorough and explains which buttons correspond to buttons on your old device -LRB- ie colored buttons on the DirecTV remote are now the `` A , B , C , D '' on the Sony universal remote -RRB- . Good value for the money . 	Remote Control
The product arrived ahead of time and appeared to be in great condition , although it was not the product that was shown in the description . Upon using the device , I realized it had only one function , and that was an iPhone charger . It did not transmit to my vehicles radio , there was no display , and the remote control did not work even after purchasing a new battery . I guess there is a reason its 5 bucks ... 	Remote Control
I bought this remote just over a year ago . At first it was great ! I got it set up and it worked well with everything . Just the other day however , way past the warranty dates , the thing went haywire . Everything lit up and then it froze . I could n't do anything with it . I looked for trouble-shooting tips in the manual ... There 's nothing . I called RCA and their technicians do n't know anything about the remote . They just told me to take the batteries out for a couple of minutes , push any button for at least one minute , put the batteries back in , and then try to reset it . Nope ... It 's a no-go !!!! 1 star is really pushing it for this item . I only gave it that much because I had to to write this review ! 	Remote Control

This product is admittedly not the easiest to setup . I have a receiver , dvr , dvd , and TV to control . Setup took me about thirty minutes . Then I realized I had control over where the buttons are displayed and I spent about another 3 hours trying to get all the commands I needed to display on the appropriate pages . After it was all setup it 's a breeze to use . The help button is great for when a command does n't fire but I found that turning the system off and back on usually fixes the problem 9 out of 10 times and is 100 times faster . Now even my parents can use the TV when they come over to babysit . Negatives ... The most used buttons give out after a while -LRB- the DVR 's skip ahead and replay in my case . In my setup these are located next to the display on the remote . -RRB- Plan on buying on of these once a year if you watch TV nightly . -LRB- and enjoy setting it up again . -RRB- 	Remote Control
This learning remote truly does it all . From the most complicated of audio\/video applications to the simplest of commands , I find myself relying on it . I am no longer thinking about the original equipment remotes . The web site is easy to learn , intuitive and reliable . The LCD screen is very adequate , and most buttons are where you 'd expect them to be . And , if you do n't like where that special button is located naturally - change it . I did ! 	Remote Control

This is a great remote , very nicely built , and has great protential , but unfortunately it is crippled somewhat by the software . It took me more than 4 days to program it the way I wanted , but once that was done , it is as good as any remote you could get . It can learn almost any command and do anything , if it were n't for some restrictions by the online software , but fortunately there are ways to get around some of the problems . Pro : Huge database of devices , and for those that are not in the database , you can easily learn it if you have the original remote . One of the best part about the database is that you may find some features that were n't available from original remote . For me it was discrete input buttons , so I do n't have to scroll through 6 video modes to get to a particular device . This alone was worth the price . Con : very complicate to program the remote perfectly . Software is very restrictive , and some options that you may want to use is hidden in layers and layers of options -LRB- like repeat timing -RRB- . They enforce this `` activity '' scheme , which is great when watching DVD or other things which require multiple devices , but for me , I watch tv most of the time and only use my tv and nothing else . So I would rather stay with just the old fashion universal remote functionality when watching only tv . Fortunately there is a way to get around this , by setting one of the buttons as a power toggle , and setting the power option of the TV as `` always leave on '' . Also it does not allow programming of macros . I was able to get around this with another old universal remote . I create the macro I wanted on the old remote and have the logitech learn the macro in `` raw '' mode , which works great . 	Remote Control
The logitech 880 is a great remote for people who wish to control their audio\/video system from one remote . This is not to say that the Logitech simplifies anything though . While most basic functions can be accessed from the `` activity '' screen , making some adjustments will require you to select that device and then access the item through a menu . There are a few extra button pushes to access certain items . The top menu buttons are awkward to press , requiring a second hand or repositioning the hand you use to hold the remote . I bought this with the intent of making our system easier for my wife to control . However , she has not been able to adjust to the activity based functions . I guess pressing a button that says `` Watch TV '' is not a replacement for traditional power buttons . Customization is this remotes greatest strength and weakness . I have spent probably two hours fiddling with various buttons and menus . Do not expect this remote to work the way you want it to out of the box . You will need to invest some time in customizing it to take advantage of what it can do . Also , the Logitech did not control my Olevia 537H TV correctly out of the box . I had to teach the 880 certain functions and reassign some buttons . At this price level , I expected the Logitech to have all of that information available . Is it worth it ? Sure , but not with a few caveats . The Logitech does n't do anything better than your standard remotes , it just condenses everything down . In fact , it can make certain functions more time consuming than just picking up a 2nd remote . This remote is best suited for people with MANY devices where the macro functions can be particularly useful . If you only have 3 remotes sitting on your couch , you are probably better off keeping them . 	Remote Control

I mainly bought this because my wife complained about the Comcast remote being too clumsy and complicated . The Harmony 880 was a little complicated to set up , but not as bad as some others I 've had . The computer interface made the process pretty mistake free . I was concerned that it might have problems with my TV -LRB- a Panasonic HDTV -RRB- because you have to cycle thru the inputs to get to where you want to go . But after the first time I used the Harmony 880 , it worked like a charm ! And the price ... way too expensive at $ 250 , but I can live with $ 126 !!!! 	Remote Control
I just purchased my Canon Rebel XSI and wanted to include myself in some family photos . I always used the delay timer in other cameras I have owned and it was always a rush to get back into the picture before the timer activated . The other feature that is great about using this wireless remote is you can take multiple shots if someone moves or you think you want to retake some shots with different facial expressions . This is a tiny small accessory that attaches to the neck strap and is always with you when you travel with the camera . 	Remote Control

I bought the ML-L3 remote for my Nikon D40 because the camera has no provision for a cable release . I use the camera on a tripod for copy work and pressing the shutter button manually causes a slight movement that can blur the image -LRB- even on a tripod -RRB- . With the wireless remote , that issue is solved . Initially I thought the remote could only be used while pointing it directly at the front of the camera since that is where the sensor is located . Much to my surprise , however , the remote works from any angle around the camera including from behind . 	Remote Control

This is one of those things that until you have it you did n't know you needed it . Now I wish I had bought one when I bought the camera , I use it all the time to take close up and remote pictures . I can now be in the pictures I take !!! Could use a longer range but if it is in direct line with the camera it works great ! I will buy another because it is so small that I know I will lose it at some point . But it does have a very sturdy case that can be attached to the strap of the camera so that should prevent loss . I love and use it all the time now !!! 	Remote Control

Wasted two days working with this remote . It often forgot the few components that it learned . It had no clue how to work my plasma tv . It turned on the home theater sound about one in four times . I wasted hours with customer support . I would suggest finding out if your components are already known by logitech . If the remote needs to learn anything it can have problems . The biggest problem I had with it was powering up the tv or changing inputs . Customer support could n't get these settings to work either . Some have left good reviews , all I can say is make sure your items are in the logitech data base . 	Remote Control

Bought this for the wife for christmas , she 's a huge harry potter fan . She got a great kick out of it after we got it programmed and it was a lot of fun .

I 've been using this remote for about a year and a half now . It has some great features that I ca n't live without , however the craftsmanship and ergonomics of this thing really ruin it for me . First , the good ... I love how this Harmony switches on and off multiple devices with the press of a single button . That feature is the bread and butter of this remote and it 's great . Instead of wading through the inputs menu of multiple devices on multiple remotes , I press one button and the remote takes care of it all . If a command is missed by a device , for whatever reason , the `` help '' button almost always fixes the problem with one press . I would rate this remote a 3 or 4 because of these features if not for the shabby build quality . The first remote I had for about year before it needed to be replaced . The charging dock stopped charging the remote . I contacted Logitech 's technical support and without any hassle , they sent me a brand new remote . I 'd rate Logitech 's tech support A + , but I am not reviewing their service , I 'm reviewing this remote . I 've been using the second remote for 6 months now . I press the volume up button and it turns the volume down . It 's broken ... 0 for 2 As these remotes broke on me I became more critical of the design . I realized I disliked the screen . I bought the remote because of the screen and now I hated it . It is a novel idea but it takes up way too much button pushing real-estate . Besides hitting it once to turn things on I rarely use it , and because of it , buttons that I use often are all tiny and scrunched at the bottom . Besides the size of the buttons the design and layout of them also leaves a lot to be desired . All of the function buttons are almost exactly the same size and there is not any tactile differences between them . This leads to lots of miss-presses . Also , the number pad is extremely low on the remote which makes using it without two hands very unbalanced and uncomfortable . I was hoping this remote would be the end-all , be-all remote . Unfortunately , it was not for me . My next remote needs to have the single-button-for-multiple - devices feature , like this one , but it also needs big and chunky buttons , and a more ergonomic design . 	Remote Control
To start , my remote was branded `` JYC '' on the top . Right out of the box , this product impressed me , very solid construction , no visible flaws , the cord is even a rubbery one - seems durable at the moment . This remote is fully featured and has can be setup for delays , long exposures , intervalometer -LRB- you set # of photos , and time between shots -RRB- , and sound can be disabled too ! -LRB- yes , it beeps every second -RRB- . I did n't have any problems with the shutter lock on mine unlike the other reviewer . perhaps he got a bad unit . There is a nice 2 color LED on the upper right , green on half press -LRB- to focus and whatnot -RRB- and red on full press . The remote performs identically to the button on the dslr . My only issue with the intervalometer is that if you need to set it to , say , 200 photos , you 're going to have to do a lot of button pressing to get to that number . better off setting it to '' -- '' mode , and stop the photo taking manually . Maximum Limit is 399 Photos - I have n't tried taking that many photos with it yet . There is even a backlight - not very bright but good for night sky photography . I popped open the cover and observed that some of the solder joints were a bit messy , but they seem to work at the moment . Not going to try to fix something that is n't broken . The makers of this remote seem to have really thought this little device through . ~ 20 $ shipped ? Bargain ! 	Remote Control

I had an old universal remote , but with all the specialized buttons on equipment these days , it had become obsolete . You pretty much have to have something with a screen that can display the correct names of the various specialty buttons , or else you need to be really good at memorizing stuff . I not only wanted something that could control EVERY feature of EVERY device , but it also had to be convenient . When you have to go into the receiver mode to change something on the receiver , then into the cable box mode to change something there , then into the TV mode to change something there , well , it 's actually easier to just pick up the remotes that came with the devices than to push all those buttons on the universal remote . I 'm happy to say that this Harmony 880 does everything I could ever want a remote to do . It can easily control every feature of every device , but also do it with the utmost of convenience . I really did n't think too much of the `` Activity '' mode before I purchased this , but once I started using it , I realized it 's a truly brilliant idea . It makes all the difference when it comes to convenience . For instance , in the `` Watch TV '' activity mode , I 've programmed the remote to control all functions of the cable box , allow me to go into the menu on the TV , and control often-used features -LRB- like surround sound mode -RRB- on the receiver , all at the same time . Without having to go into different modes on the remote . Very , very cool ! Of course you can choose which button controls what , and label the buttons next to the screen exactly the way you want them . But nothing is perfect - I was having a problem with programming certain buttons in the software , after which I would hit `` Done '' , which is supposed to save your changes , but my changes were n't being saved . I called up Harmony support , and got a hold of a very nice gentleman from Canada . We figured out the problem - I had programmed the exact same command into two different buttons . It does n't like that . Once I deleted one of those , everything went back to working perfectly . I 'm using Windows Vista , and other than the little confusion I just mentioned , the software seems to work just fine . Overall , I could n't be more pleased with this item . It truly does everything I could want it to do , allows total customization , looks very stylish , has an excellent button layout , and even has a recharging base so I never have to worry about running down the batteries . A solid 5 stars . Update : I 've had this 3 years now . After about 2 years , the number buttons got sticky and you really had to mash on them with your fingernail to get them to work . After 3 years , the up arrow and channel up buttons have both quit working . Considering the price of this product , a 2 - 3 year lifespan just is n't acceptable . I also had occasion to call customer service once , but free customer support only lasts for a certain time after purchase . After that , they want $ 30 just to talk to you , which of course includes no guarantee that they 'll actually be able to help you with your specific problem . Unacceptable . Update # 2 : After 4 years , the volume up\/down control , channel up\/down control and cursor up arrow button are all basically useless . Four years for what this thing cost ? Unacceptable .

... pick this Canon remote . I purchased this one after being disappointed with the Shoot one I got earlier . The Shoot remote works , but the range was really weak . Could you imagine being in the group-shot scenario , and having to mess with your weak Shoot remote to the point of having to switch to the camera 's timer anyway in the end ? This Canon remote does what you expect it to , with a much greater degree of reliability , from an acceptable distance , and it even comes with a little case . If\/when you can afford the price difference , buy this genuine Canon product . Just realize - it only works from the front -LRB- self-portrait style -RRB- - unless you attach a mirror system ...

I like this FM transmitter . I 've heard about how these transmitters give poor quality sound but It sounds great in my truck . I found one station that works and have n't changed it since .

I purchased this rice cooker because when I made rice in my 8 cup rice cooker I either did n't eat all of it and threw much away , or I only made a little and the bottom ended up burning my rice because it was too powerful for how little rice I had in there . This rice cooker was just right for the amount of rice I cook . It 's compact and efficient . I will say that I am worried about breaking the lid as it 's made of glass and is very precariously set upon the top . It almost feels like it does n't fit the cooker . Pros : Easy to use - simple press down to cook lines inside pot for easy measurement of water Small amounts of rice at a time to reduce wasted food Cord is long enough Inexpensive Cons : Precarious glass lid -LRB- ... -RRB- 	Rice Cooker

I bought an earlier version of this rice cooker a couple of years ago and have been delighted with it . Based on my recommendation , two friends have bought them . And I myself just bought a third one -LRB- the new version -RRB- as a present for another friend . Nothing to add to the positive comments from others in this forum . We have n't checked out the bread-making capability yet , but the new one makes rice and steel-cut oatmeal just as well as the old one . My one small complaint is that it is difficult to clean next to the hinge . But that 's minor , compared to the cooker 's overall quality and convenience . For what it 's worth , my favorite everyday rice by far is Kokuho Rose rice , which cooks perfectly in the Sanyo . You can buy the rice at any Asian food store , and at many supermarkets that have a large `` international food '' section . 	Rice Cooker
I just got this , and just ate my first meal from it today . Brown rice -LRB- the hardest to cook well -RRB- , and some steamed organic carrots , broccoli , baby bok choy and mustard greens . Some dried oregano and a little lemon juice for flavor . Perfect rice , delicious meal ! I followed the grocery store recommended proportions -LRB- 2 cups water to 1 measure of rice -RRB- for bulk long-grain brown rice , not the user manual -LRB- 1 up water to 1 measure of rice -RRB- and cooked it for about an hour , adding the veggie steamer at about 45 minutes . It went to warm after about an hour , and rather than risk it burning the rice on the bottom , I let it sit on warm for 5 minutes and then unplugged it and left it for another 5 minutes . I stirred it with a silicone spatula a couple of times while cooking . -LRB- The plastic spoon was missing from the box , but I would not have used it anyway , because I want to preserve the teflon as long as possible -RRB- . The results were , to repeat , perfect . A simple meal , totally delicious , cooked without a kitchen . I like my toys , and I was looking at a stainless steel Japanese model with a supercomputer running it , that cost north of $ 250 . I bought this one on impulse , and it did the job for about $ 14 . I do n't know how long it will last , and I do n't care . It will pay for itself in 3 or 4 meals . A great intro to using a rice cooker , and I may be using it for years to come . Recommended for a single person if you are cooking a complete meal , or 2 people if you are cooking rice as a side dish . 	Rice Cooker
This is my first rice cooker and i have to say that I could n't be happier with this product . I mean really what more could you really ask for . Add rice , water , salt and butter -LRB- if you want -RRB- hit the button and forget about it . go on with the rest of your cooking . It has a `` keep warm '' function that happens automatically so your rice is nice and warm . And the clean up is so simple that my 5 year old can do it and she does ! 	Rice Cooker

Owning a Zojurishi is so way worth it . Why ? It just plain cooks the rice as well as it can be made . I few years ago , I relocated to a far away local and eventually purchased a run of the mill rice cooker , and never liked it . Finally purchased another Zojurishi and now think I was silly for the time I did not have it . Full features and cooking options are cool too . The only draw back on my current model is that it does not have a run off for excess condensation , like my other one had . This does not affect the quality of my rice , just a noticeable difference . I shopped and Amazon offered an excellent price with free shipping . No brainer . 	Rice Cooker
Had the rice cooker for maybe 3-4 weeks before it broke on us , try another brand I have been let down by Black and Decker many times , no idea what it is they just become faulty too soon after purchase for my liking . 	Rice Cooker
This is smaller than is written in the product description . I could only cook 1 cup of brown rice ; if I put in more rice , it would overflow and mess up the table . Otherwise , there was no problem with the cooker . 	Rice Cooker
My wife and I became busy recently and decided it was time to finally get a rice cooker to save some time in the kitchen . We bought a cheap old-school rice cooker and the rice would scorch , water would boil out of lid , and the rice was worse than cooking the rice on the stove top . Then we decided to invest in a good rice cooker . The Zojirushi NS-LAC05 is everything we hoped for and more . We wanted a rice cooker that would make great rice , that could handle smaller amounts of rice , that had a timer , and could handle a variety of different rices . This rice cooker is a dream . - It 's attractive . We 've already received compliments from guests . - Its footprint is very reasonable for a small kitchen . - With a thick , stick proof bowl the rice does n't burn to any spot and clean up is simple . - It easily makes rice for 2 adults -LRB- 1.5 of the `` cups '' for us -RRB- but could handle 4 adults -LRB- 3 `` cups '' -RRB- with normal eating habits . Note : the cups are n't full size cups of rice . - It does a great job on a variety of rices ; there are different settings for different rices and the measurement markings appear correct for different rices . So far we 've tried long grain brown , medium grain brown , sushi , jasmine , white basmati , brown basmati , and brown\/white mixes . We have n't had a bad batch of rice . - The computer 's fuzzy logic algorithm -LRB- i.e. `` Micom Neuro Fuzzy '' -RRB- constantly adjusts the temperature so the rice comes out perfect every time . I also think the cooker starts out at a low temperature and gradually steps up the heat but I 'm not 100 % sure . - The heavy bowl seems to distribute heat perfectly and there 's no scorched rice or crust attached to the bowl . - The timer is convenient for setting the rice to be completed at a specific time , at which point it keeps your rice warm . We 've found it completes cooking within a minute or two of the timer setting . There are two timer settings that you can adjust ... presumably so you could have your rice prepared for breakfast & dinner in Japan . - The retractable cord is a nice feature . - There 's even a little holder for the included rice paddle that attaches to the side of the cooker . We 've even used it to make Polenta . Just use 1 Zojirushi-cup of corn grits , chicken broth up to 2-cup brown rice mark , and cook using the white rice setting . When it 's done , put the mixture in a bowl and let it cool to room temperature . I 'd highly recommend this rice cooker . It 's probably not big enough for a big family but for a single person , a couple , or a small family it will probably fit the bill perfectly . I ca n't over-emphasize the quality of rice the cooker produces ... it 's like a dream having rice as good or better than a restaurant at home . We probably eat grain cooked in this machine 6-7 nights a week . Once you switch to this Zojirushi you 'll never want to go back to your old ways . 	Rice Cooker
I had a cheap rice maker and decided to upgrade when my daughter moved out and wanted mine . This is one of the greatest additions to my kitchen . As well as making the greatest rice , expecially for sushi , it also makes wonderful hot cereal that you can wake up to when you set the timer the night before . Throw in some dried fruit and spices and it is a wonderful smell to wake up to as well as good for you . The old rice maker used to get crunchy stuff on the bottom and the brown rice was sometimes chewier than it should have been but never this one . It also steams stuff to perfection in a couple minutes . I have n't used it as a slow cooker yet but I have no doubt it will be great . I love it , it is worth every cent and Amazon was spectacular at getting it to me . I ordered it right before Christmas not expecting it till after the holiday and it got here in 2 days , just in time to make Christmas sushi . 	Rice Cooker
I bought this as a gift for my husband who is a rice-aholic and considers himself a connoisseur of rice . He absolutely LOVES this rice cooker ! Its very easy to use and makes very good rice ! This rice cooker is highly recommended ! 	Rice Cooker
For the price , this is a beautiful rice cooker . The pictures really do n't do it justice . It is very well made and solid . I 've made great wild and brown rice with it . For this , the only drawback is time . It takes over an hour for brown rice . It was perfect , I just wish I knew how long it took before I started dinner ! My daughter and I got this one together and she loves it . She says it 's her rice cooker . I 'm looking forward to making a few of the other recipes , for things like oatmeal , and other time sensitive dishes . 	Rice Cooker
My wife and I wanted to cook brown rice for our kids but never had the time . We bought it as a Christmas present to ourselves and we could not be happier . We are in love with the ease of the programing mode , we get perfect rice right on time all we have to do is remember to set it up in the morning before we go to work . Our kids love the brown rice and the songs that the cooker plays when it is finished ! Clean up is really easy can not say enough about how great this rice cooker is . 	Rice Cooker
I bought this little rice cooker over 1.5 years ago . As others have said , it 's looks very small , almost like a toy . I intended to use it only occasionally to make rice . But after discovering how easy it is to use , and how dependably it cooks the rice - have used it several times a week . I love the smell of the steaming rice that escapes from the vent while the rice is cooking . I usually make the maximum amount which is a huge plate full for one person or a very good size portion for two people . I make white and brown rice and sometimes make the packaged rice side dishes -LRB- with spice packets -RRB- and they all come out great . This is a great value and has been very dependable . It 's one of my favorite purchases from Amazon . 	Rice Cooker
I bought this rice cooker on one of the lightning deals from Amazon , but after using it , would pay triple if I ever have to replace it . It 's a tiny rice cooker , but it 's perfect for multiple types of rice , quinoa and oatmeal . I use the cooker every morning to make a single serving of oatmeal . The device is really a set-and-go sort of thing , and automatically shuts off when the rice or grain is 15 minutes from being ready . As I said in the title for this review , I 'm guessing this is going to be my best purchase of 2011 . 	Rice Cooker
This is my first rice cooker , and I love it ! Very easy to use , and I recently found out that it is pretty dummy-proof . I was planning on doing rice and steamed asparagus together and , not thinking , pushed the wrong setting on the cooker . While it took me 5-10 minutes to realize this , once I pushed the correct button the cooker adjusted for the mistake and the rice came out very well . That was my first time steaming vegetables as well , and they came through really great too . The take-out tray in the inside also makes it pretty easy to clean . I typically make smaller batches of rice for 1-2 people , and they come out great every time . It was a little bigger than I was anticipating ; I was hoping to get a smaller machine but overall am very happy with my purchase . 	Rice Cooker
it is so beautiful and fits girls ! i think it is enough for a college student ! I like it very much ! 	Rice Cooker
This rice cooker is wonderful . You throw in the rice some water and forget about it . Then in about an hour you have great rice . Also has a delay timer and will keep the rice warm for hours . It sings ` twinkle twinkle little star ' when its done . Very convenient 	Rice Cooker
My wife and I just love the rice cooker because of the quality of the cooking bowl and the design layout is very simple and straight forward . The cooking time is about 35 mins for two people and 55 mins for four people . Overall , this is a good rice cooker and we love it . 	Rice Cooker
This is the perfect rice cooker . I love its tiny size -LRB- its footprint is just a little larger than a gallon of Crystal Geiser water -RRB- , the ease of use , the nifty retractable cord , and the timer -- oh the timer ! What a wonderful invention . Makes dinner so much easier to plan . The only complaint I have is that it is MUCH too small for our little family -LRB- me , my husband , and our 18-month-old baby -RRB- . Other reviewers have said it 's perfect for a small family . Not so for us . Maybe it 's because we eat more rice than the average `` small '' family , but after one use , it 's quite apparent that we will be selling our gently used one and buying the 5.5 cup version . We eat both brown and white rice , but I 've only cooked white rice so far . Prospective buyers should know that the max capacity for white rice is only TWO cups -LRB- not the full capacity of three cups -RRB- . Not sure why . All I know is that `` for best results , '' the instructions recommend not cooking any more than 2 cups of white rice . Hope this helps . Other than the size not working for us , this cooker is great . 	Rice Cooker
Perfect rice every time . White , brown it does not matter . The start up timer is geat . Timer can be set for a completion time . The warming feature keeps the rice edible for about an hour after cooking is finished if you are not too fussy . One annoying thing is that the countdown timer only becomes active in the last 10min . If you are syncronising the completion time for food this is kind of a nuisance . The other annoying thing is that it cooks very slow . There other models that cook faster , but they are more expensive . 	Rice Cooker
My first rice cooker , and I was surprised that `` 6 cups '' does n't mean 6 cups ... but rather `` 6 Oster cups '' , which are much smaller than a normal cup . If you lose -LRB- or melt -RRB- their provided measuring cup , you 're mostly screwed . All that said , it does work well , and frees up a burner on the stove to do other things , just do n't expect to make `` real cups '' of rice . 	Rice Cooker
I want to start eating better , so I 'm exploring some simpler Japanese foods . Right now , that is onigiri -- rice balls stuffed with fish or something salty , and then wrapped with nori . I ate these for breakfast nearly every day when I was in Japan because you could pick them up at the convenience store . Anyway , after making a couple batches of rice on the stove -- which required a lot of watching and tending -- I decided to check out rice cooker prices . Turns out , you can find them cheap enough to make getting one completely worth it . This little cooker is plenty big enough for one serving at a time -LRB- though it 's capable of three cups of cooked rice -RRB- . Someone else 's review mentioned traveling with this ... completely feasible because this thing is tiny ! The cooking bowl is sufficiently non-stick -- stove cooked rice in the pan I have was a mess . With this cooker , not a grain was wasted . Super hassle-free . Great value . Very glad I bought this . 	Rice Cooker
First time worked great ! Need to adjust the water depending on the type of rice . Easy to do and great to have rice soooo easy . 	Rice Cooker
This is NOT a food steamer . I purchased it as a Christmas present and I 'm STILL trying to get -LRB- . . -RRB- to make the situation right . Their solution was to just send me a steamer tray which wo n't work if the item is manufactured to only be a rice cooker . I 'm asking them to send me a product that matches the item description . I 'll let you all know if they honor this request . Meanwhile , do n't buy this product !! 	Rice Cooker
I used to have one rice cooker from Black & Decker and it worked very well . So I decided to buy another one . This one is so small and besides , it broke down after two months . I smelled something burnt and the light was off , so we unplugged it . It never worked again . Though the price is low , you get what you paid for . 	Rice Cooker
I love this rice cooker ! I make a lot of rice - usually white , brown , and mixed . I could never get the brown & mixed grain rice cooked right in my old-style rice cooker . It 's turned out perfectly every single time in the Sanyo ! This cooker is very easy to use and the instructions that come with it are clear . The machine comes with two inner pots and two inner lids - one for rice & another for everything else . The rice pot is heavier than the everything-else pot . Both cook just fine . I 've steamed lots of veggies using the steamer basket . I even made the bread pudding recipe from the manual a couple of times -LRB- with the addition of brandy-soaked raisins -RRB- . The Sanyo cooks rice so perfectly that I 'll happily overlook the two minor negatives I 've encountered . 1 -RRB- The interior pot is not non-stick . Rice does n't stick to the rice pot . -LRB- I usually add a tiny bit of oil to the water . -RRB- But , things really stick to the everything-else pot . 2 -RRB- The steamer insert is plastic & has acquired a faint orange tint from cooking carrots . That 's probably the nature of the plastic . In my book these are really minor negatives . I 'd buy this product again . 	Rice Cooker
This product is great I received it 2 days after purchasing it . I use it everyday it 's perfect for a dorm room or a little apartment . Also , it makes perfect rice everytime for one person or more depending on how much you like to eat , plus it was great price . 	Rice Cooker
Ever play with one of those Easy Bake ovens when you were a kid ? Well get ready for a similar experience because making rice has never been so easy or so fun . LOL , I know I sound like a television commercial but seriously , if you 're obsessed with rice like me then you absolutely must have one of these . So simple to use ; just pour the correct ratio of rice and water in the removable bowl , plug the steamer in and push down the little button -LRB- like a bread toaster -RRB- , wait a few minutes and viola ... delicious rice . Also the bowl that you actually cook the rice in is porous enough to resist clingy rice and therefore super easy-peasy to clean up . I received mine as an Amazon gift from a friend after I mentioned to her that I usually made instant rice because ... well because I am really lousy at boiling the regular variety . And so speaking from that perspective , let me say that I think this would be a perfect gift for just about any occasion . It 's relatively attractive and really small -LRB- considering you can make a ton of rice with it -RRB- and would probably look great just about anywhere . So if you love rice , then I highly recommend this wonderful rice cooker from Oster . : o -RRB- 	Rice Cooker
love this cooker ... being an indian you know we make all ur food and veggies in cooker ... made malai kofta and fried rice quickly with its help ... . great price works great no complaints ! 	Rice Cooker
I had to have a great rice cooker . Not just one of those cheap ones with the glass lids that almost no one in Asia has anymore , but a fancy , computerized one . So when I saw this rice cooker on Amazon and saw that it had a separate pot for steaming\/slow cooking , I was sold . I actually had my eye on a 5.5 cup Zojirushi cooker before , but the features -LRB- compared to this Sanyo one -RRB- just did not compare or justify the price difference . Have had this cooker for about three months now , and have used it at least once a week -LRB- some weeks more , some weeks less ... it varies due to my schedule and pantry items -RRB- . Rice comes out cleanly and evenly-cooked every time -LRB- even if I add too little or too much water -RRB- . I 've been cooking jasmine rice and brown rice in here , and have been able to keep both jasmine and brown rice in the fridge for up to five days without it spoiling and getting too hard to eat -LRB- especially for fried rice -RRB- . I 've also steamed dumplings in it , and the only complaint I have regarding that is that I wish there was a better steam tray for this unit . The steam tray that comes with this cooker has concave dips in it to accommodate 8 eggs , and that gets slightly annoying , but only from an aesthetic point of view . Not really a dealbreaker ! The recipe booklet that comes with this cooker has some great recipe ideas . I 've only tried the beef rice jook recipe so far . It 's a bit on the thick side -LRB- like the consistency of REALLY thick oatmeal -RRB- , but it at least gives you a starting point to tweak the recipe to your liking on some popular Asian -LRB- mainly Chinese -RRB- dishes . Timer function is great , if a bit confusing to remember the first few times , along with the 12-hour warming function -LRB- though I 've never had to use the warming function for longer than an hour so far -RRB- . No warming function for rice porridge , but if you turn the unit off and then back on again , it will automatically stay on `` warm '' . The noise that this unit makes when your food is done is also not the usual somewhat-annoying , very cheesy musical tunes that a lot of other fancy rice cookers have . It 's just a standard beeping noise , and not too annoying or long . Overall , I could n't be happier with this cooker . If I can find a better steaming tray so that I can maybe steam some meals with my rice , I would be in heaven . This cooker definitely has the potential to do it all . 	Rice Cooker
This is my first rice cooker and I do n't really understand how I ever lived without it . It is really easy to use . And the rice always comes out perfectly . For a super fast meal , through in some veg in the steamer tray and I 've got a complete meal . I was a little worried at first about the size , since I only cook for myself . But once I have rice , I find different ways to eat it and I 've never regretted having an abundance of the stuff . Definitely a win . 	Rice Cooker
Everything is good with this product , just it is too small even for one person . I sometime want to steam some vegetable but it is too small . 	Rice Cooker
The description is misleading . It has a capacity for 3 cup of cooked rice , which is less than 1 cup of uncooked rice . This is a toy , not even made enough rice for 1 person . Do n't buy it . 	Rice Cooker
I admit it - - despite being raised in Hawaii , I never had a rice cooker of my own before . I always wanted one , and for a number of reasons I felt like treating myself to something luxurious and fabulous using my tax refund . So , after reading the descriptions of this rice cooker , I ordered it despite the ridiculously high price . It is great . All you do is measure the rice using their little measuring cup and put it in the rice cooker , add water up to the line , push the button , and forget about it until you hear the little song that it plays when the rice is done . I had been eating `` boil-in-the-bag '' rice but this is so much easier and definitely a huge step-up in quality of the cooked rice . I am a single person and find that by cooking the smallest amount I get one and a fourth cups of white rice , which is just right for me . This is produced by filling their measuring cup with rice up to the 1\/2 cup mark plus water up to the corresponding line on the bowl . The `` cups '' measured with their measuring cup are n't a full cup but some other unit of measurement . I probably eat rice twice as often now that I have the rice cooker because it is so easy to use . Rice comes out perfectly every time , and clean-up is a breeze -LRB- though I did n't see anything about dishwasher-safe , so I just clean the bowl and measuring cup and spatula manually , but it hardly takes any time at all -RRB- . I am retired so I have n't tried the timer , but that should be a great feature for working people who could come home to find warm , perfect rice done and waiting for them . This rice cooker takes up less room on my countertop than I had expected , and it looks nice as you can tell . UPS delivery was fast and it arrived in perfect condition . 	Rice Cooker
I had this product for less than a year and I went to cook rice one day and the cook lever would n't stay down . It kept popping up like it does when the rice is done . . I 'm very dissapointed , usually Black & Decker products are good products , but not in this case . I 'm on here looking for a new one , and I can guarantee it wo n't be Black & Decker 	Rice Cooker
this is a really good rice cooker and very simple to use , all you do is add rice , add water -LRB- according to how much ever rice you put in -RRB- , and stir after 15 minutes and it 's done after about another 5-10 ... i use it about 2-3 times a week ... 	Rice Cooker
I have used my Zojirushi Fuzy Logic -LRB- I have no idea what fuzzy logic means -RRB- Rice Cooker for at least 3 years for medium grain white rice . The rice is always purfect . This year , I discovered `` Rice Select '' brand rice blends and love the Royal Blend Whole Grain : Texmati brown and red rice with barley & rye . You can order this rice from Amazon . The `` Semi Brown '' setting works perfectly and takes about an hour to cook . I live near Denver , so the altitude is a factor . I add water just past the mark on the cooking pan so the rice is not dry when done . The clean up really is not that hard and is way better than a pot of rice overboiling on my stove . 	Rice Cooker
I am japanese and moved away from my mother who made rice all the time . Practically lived on rice . This thing does the trick . I just make rice . Put it in freezer bags and store it in freezer till i want some . Then throw a little in microwave . Or make sushi . Yeah it may be a little messy . If u want something totally clean . Ur stupid ! Move back in with ur mommy then . And she can do it for u. Everything is messy ! Quit being lazy and clean it up . There is absolutely NOTHING wrong with this thing . Although I wont be using the steamer much . If any . I just like rice ! 	Rice Cooker
Really like the timer feature , which lets you set the finishing time . Perfect right on time , every time . Not sure if cheaper models do the same job , but I can definitely say that this one does it very well , and I 'm very satisfied . 	Rice Cooker
Black and Decker engineer their products in America . This allows them the legal right to say made in the USA . Never the less , all of their products are still made in China and shipped to an assembly plant in Mexicali where assembled and packaged complete with a made in the USA sticker to sell here . Having said that , the Chinese make a terrific rice cooker for Black and Decker to sell us and my only dislike is you can not turn off the `` Warm '' feature which stays on after cooking . So if you do n't take the rice off or unplug it when it 's done you can dry your rice out . 	Rice Cooker
for the new years resolution to lose weight , I am cutting down on starch foods . The Zojirushi rice cooker is perfect for that reason . . setting the program is simple and you are able to set it in the morning for whenever you wish it to be ready for your meal ... 	Rice Cooker
It 's a great rice maker - makes good rice without effort . My only cause not to give it 5 stars is that it takes a long time to make the rice - approximately 2-3 times longer than my old cheapo rice cooker . BUT the rice it does make is way better . I especially enjoy the timer function so I can wake up to freshly made rice or oatmeal in the morning . I would say that it is definately worth the money so far . 	Rice Cooker
There are a number of issues with this product that make it a deal breaker . 1 . After NINETY minutes , the brown rice was just getting done . It was only a cup and a half of rice . Lord help us if we actually wanted to make more ; I 'd have to start it in the morning ! 2 . the rice was gloppy , closer to rice pudding than brown rice . 3 . It does not cook 16 cups of rice . It cooks 8 . 4 . The steamer sits INSIDE the unit , so if you want to make the full amount of rice , you can not simultaneously steam . This product is going back . I definitely would NOT purchase this item . 	Rice Cooker
Why buy such an expensive rice cooker instead of a cheaper one ? This rice cooker makes the best rice I have ever tasted . Zojirushi is a respected brand for quality , and this is a quality device . I like that the cord rolls up into the body , and it has a handle for easy transport . The inner pot can be removed easily and is simple to clean . I do not need to scrub it at all , and the rice never burns on the bottom . I like the features and how easy it is to use . I especially like the timer feature . It was worth every penny and I look forward to using it for years . 	Rice Cooker
I received this rice cooker as a present , and I love it ! It cooks the rice perfectly and steams the vegetables well . I have not tried to cook meat it in , as I am a vegetarian , but it works great for what I need . I do add extra water when steaming vegetables while cooking rice . I have cooked asparagus , brussels sprouts , and zucchini in this while also cooking rice . I have noticed it sputters a little , but mine does not make a big mess as other reviewers have noticed . I love that I can switch it on and walk away until ready to eat ! 	Rice Cooker
http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/review\/create-review\/ref=cm_cr_pr_wr_but_top?ie=UTF8&nodeID=&asin=B002DML11K# I purchased this item to use for cooking long grain brown rice , because my sister had a smaller model that cooked brown rice well . I had never used a rice cooker before . I kept changing the ratio of brown rice to water after trying it the way the instruction booklet said ; but the rice never got done enough . Unfortunately , I missed the return window ; so must keep this item . I believe it probably works well for white rice , but white rice is not as nutritious as brown . I did not try to cook white rice with it ; because I do not eat white rice . It would help if the descripton specified that a 6-Cup Rice Cooker means it cooks 6 cups of raw rice which is A LOT of rice ! 	Rice Cooker
Perfect rice everytime , with the added delight of `` Twinkle , Twinkle Little Star '' when it sets off for the cooking journey . It also makes perfect hot cereal from steel-cut oats . I totally recommend this rice cooker . 	Rice Cooker
I purchased this for a friend . I thought -LRB- at this price -RRB- it would have a stainless steel interior cooking bowl and interior . Poor assumption on my part . My friend will not eat from ANYTHING with an aluminum surface so I ended up keeping it for myself . The unit has an aluminum lid the bowl is aluminum that is coated with a non-stick surface inside and out . It is very easy to clean . It is a top quality unit no doubt . The interior bowl is marked for water level and you get a scoop with a prescribed size for the unit . I have cooked white rice , brown rice and steel cut oatmeal in it . For my liking the white rice needs more water than the bowl measure requests . My origional thought was the unit was too expensive for what it did but I like it very much . After one year of use , I ca n't say that there is another appliance that I have enjoyed and got so much use out of . I am a fan of this appliance beyond words . The rice is always the same , perfect . I add a little extra water for my liking . 	Rice Cooker
I believe it is the best machine out there to cook perfect rice . No burning or hard rice on the bottom . Perfect for a couple or a single person , anymore you would need a 5 cup model . The warmer is awesome ! It still warms the rice like you just cooked it , without it going smelly or hard . Another great feature is the programming , it cooks when I want it to cook automatically ! The bad qualities of this product is minor . I wish they would make a more attractive style . Even though it is stainless steel accent , there is still that plastic white around it . Also the porridge setting works , I was mistaken for it to make congee . So it does makes mushy rice porridge , but it does not make watery congee rice . I wish it comes with a steamer rack , but I guess this version is too small . Another minor thing is the cooking programming time , it goes by military time , not by 24hr . 	Rice Cooker
THIS WAS THE BEST THING EVER , WE MADE SUSHI AND THE RICE Came out perfect and so did the sushi , it is everthing they said it was and more we steam vegtables with fish in it and it is great . thank you . 	Rice Cooker
I just got this cooker today , so durability is not something I can rate yet . These are the things I like ; 1 . No plastic . This was important for me . Both the bottom rice cooker and the steamer tray are metal . The lid is glass . 2 . Nice and compact . I cook for my wife and myself , so I do n't something huge , and of course storage space is always limited . The steamer tray is small ; on the other hand , the manual claims that this can cook up to 5 cups of rice . 3 . Easy cleanup . Yes some of the rice made a gooey mess in the bottom , but a little soaking took it all right out . 4 . Inexpensive . 5 . Multi-purpose . I have used it once so far , and here 's what I did . I put some brown rice in the bottom rice cooker , and some salmon , broccoli and cauliflower in the steamer tray . The manual says nothing about steaming anything other than veggies , but I thought I 'd try it . The result : Excellent . The salmon was cooked to perfection , and so were the vegetables . So I had a complete , tasty , and healthy meal , all in one cooker , and so long as I was prepared to let the bowl and the tray soak for a bit , cleanup was a breeze . Oh and you can make soups , stews , etc. instead of cooking rice . It 's not a large-capacity cooker but it would make plenty of stew for two people . Things I do n't like : 1 . No timer . It apparently senses when the steam is gone , and then switches to `` warmer '' mode automatically . The only control is a switch that goes from `` cook '' to `` warmer . '' This also means that you have to unplug it to turn it off , though that does n't bother me . That 's about the only thing I have to carp about so far . It did n't bubble or spit at all . If I can get at least three or four years of regular -LRB- and by regular I mean nearly daily -RRB- use out of this thing , I 'll consider it an extremely good value . Update June 2010 : OK sometimes it does bubble and spit a bit . Nothing terrible . I 've used it probably 25 times altogether without any problems . Considering the low purchase price , I 'd call this thing a good value . I 'd buy it again . 	Rice Cooker
Excellent product and great value . I only cook 1-2 cups of rice in it . Not sure it would cope with any more than that as it is quite small . 	Rice Cooker
Small but powerful the rice comes out great . My only qualm would be that if you it sitting in the pot for a long time , it starts to clump a bit more than is optimal . 	Rice Cooker
I 'm one of those people who believes in `` the less clutter , the better , '' so I 'm always loathe to purchase kitchen equipment that I might never use . I fear complicated and difficult-to-clean devices in particular . In my house , things that are n't dishwasher safe go to Goodwill in a hurry . No part of the Zojirushi cooker is dishwasher safe , but that did n't stop me from falling in love with it after the first batch of perfectly-cooked rice . Unlike the pots I used to use to cook rice , this little machine 's solid non-stick coated bowl sloughs off any and all bits of rice with the lightest brush of my hand . It 's a cinch to clean . Handwashing the rice cooker bowl takes thirty seconds . That 's less time than it used to take me to prewash\/scrub the pots I used to use to cook rice before putting them in the dishwasher . What 's more , the rice comes out perfectly and evenly cooked ; the machine plays cute songs when starting and stopping the cooking process , making cooking seem a little less awful -LRB- I hate cooking -RRB- ; the timer function means I do n't lose any sleep getting fresh rice ready at 5 AM when I pack my husband 's lunch ; and the mixed rice function lets me throw in bits of chicken or other items to be cooked at the same time . I could n't be happier with this rice cooker and would recommend it to anyone who is considering a small cooker for their own family . 	Rice Cooker
I recently bought this product to replace one that the lid broke and I really like it ! It cooks and steams very well . I 'm very pleased with its looks and the size is compact , which is perfect for my small kitchen . 	Rice Cooker
I ordered this rice cooker to replace the one I had for about 15 years . I like this model that came with the big spoon holder which I now use every time . It cooks rice well : as someone said in a review posted before I placed my order , a rice cooker is a rice cooker . And since it is the same size as my former rice cooker , it fits the old pot that I had . A full batch of cooked rice in this pot easily serves 6-8 hungry people . The delivery was also timely so I am very satisfied with the purchase . 	Rice Cooker
I received this machine 10 days ago and I 'm completely satisfied with it . Every batch of rice is perfect , and it 's a snap to clean . The timer is a terrific feature . One note though : some reviewers have warned that the white rice capacity is only 2 cups . This is n't the case . The same scale on the bowl is used for both white rice and `` mixed '' rice . The scale is misleadingly labeled . The manual states that the white rice capacity is 3 cups , while the `` mixed '' rice capacity is 2 cups . Do n't let this confusion hold you back . 	Rice Cooker
This thing is the perfect size . It works wonderfully . It 'll make enough rice or steam enough veggies for at least two . 	Rice Cooker
This rice cooker is right appropriate for me and my roommate , and it looks so cute . I expect it would last long . 	Rice Cooker
I have been using this rice cooker for 10 months now , and it has made a perfect batch of rice every single time . It is easy to use and clean up , and the warming feature works perfectly -LRB- I have accidentally left it on for over an hour without any issues -RRB- . Highly recommended , especially at under twenty dollars . 	Rice Cooker
I 've had a simple rice cooker for years and consider it the only single-purpose appliance that 's truly worthwhile . A close relative has mobility issues that keep him from easily attending food that 's cooking on the stove . I got him this little rice cooker and he now very easily makes a simple dinner in it . He cooks the rice and toward the end adds tofu on top to warm up . The meal can be varied by adding spices , sauces , sugar snap peas , scallions , right at his desk or table while he 's doing other work . And the rice pot is very easy for him to clean . The three-cup size is very light in weight , takes up little counter space , is perfect for his solo meal , but big enough to make rice for two people when his partner is home for dinner . 	Rice Cooker
I can say it does the job without having to stand over it and the rice comes out perfect . I have seen the other reviews that say to unplug it after cooking is done but I have tried both ways and it did n't seem to change anything so save a bit on the electric bill and unplug it for the ten min standing time the rice will stay warm for hours even unpluged The one con is that it does indeed brown the rice on the bottom but it you let is sit for the correct time as said in the instructions it comes out fine . If you really need to pick out the browned rice it only amounts to a few bites so not much of a loss 	Rice Cooker
This model makes exceptional and easy rice . But whoever the idiot was that decided it needed a carb -LRB- hole -RRB- should be reprimanded . Previous models with a bubbling lid worked just fine and avoided having a starchy mess all over your counter and floor area . I suggest lining the surrounding counter with damp towels , and one on the floor as well before turning this messy machine on . 	Rice Cooker
So far , I have made Sushi Rice , and Brown Rice . Both were cooked to 100 % perfection . I used vegetable broth in the place of water for the brown rice , and no other seasoning was needed . Delicious ! You wo n't regret this purchase . 	Rice Cooker
Bought the rice cooker from Amazon Nov ,06 based on the excellent reviews . Expensive rice cooker but it 's nice looking and it cooks beautiful and tasty rice better than most of the restaurants !!! I 'm so happy that I go with the right choice ! 	Rice Cooker
Its really a awesome rice cooker for 2 persons . Smaller one and keep the rice warm for quite some time . And easy carriable too . 	Rice Cooker
Just back from a month long trip to Japan and loved the convenience of using the rice cookers that were in all the apartments I stayed at . I decided it was a must have and bought this item based on the great reviews it received . I 'm absolutely thrilled with this rice cooker . It really is just so simple to use & the rice quality is great each time . I have to admit that I have not tried using the `` fast cook '' feature so can not comment on that . If you have a small family & do not need to regularly cook more than 2 cups of rice , this should do the trick . 	Rice Cooker
It was working for a month and stopped working . Initally the lights did not come up and we do not know whether the cooker is working or not . probably due to defective wiring or some things . Black & Decker should make the quality process more stringent when they procure -LRB- parts -RRB- it from outside . 	Rice Cooker
I do n't have much to add that has n't already been said . I 've owned this rice cooker now for 7 + years now -LRB- it was actually my first non college textbook purchase from Amazon -RRB- and it 's perfect . It works great for 1-3 people , and I 've never had any issues with it that were n't caused by my own mistakes of measurement . I will say that sometimes you have to figure out the best combination of water level\/cooking setting for the rice you are trying to cook , but once you 've got it the way you like it the Zojirushi cooks it consistently every time . I also have not had issues with the nonstick coating of the bowl except for a few scratches caused by someone using a metal spoon to scrape rice from the bottom , even they are minor though . Overall an amazing product ! 	Rice Cooker
easy to use and works well and can steam veggies as well also comes with accessories with good overall quality . 	Rice Cooker
I am the mother of 4 and always looking for ways to trim the budget and still eat well . We are a `` from scratch '' family and rarely , if ever , buy convenience foods . Rice is a natural go to food item when you 're trying to eat well and save money at the same time . I never seemed to be able to get it right , however ! We never had rice just because I could never cook it right . It would either be too hard still or too mushy or I would burn it on the bottom of the pan . Really , it 's rice , it should n't be that hard ! Fast forward to a week ago when the Aroma rice cooker entered our life . We now have a new love affair with this frugal grain ! Rinse the rice , toss it in and forget about it ! It 's perfect every time ! This is a busy Mom 's dream . We LOVE our rice cooker and I can not imagine a more expensive brand doing a better job at all . Should something horrible happen and our rice cooker fail in the future , we will most definitely be trying to replace it with this exact model again , very quickly ! edited to add : Used this rice cooker to boil potatoes for mashed potatoes tonight . Did a FANTASTIC job . Just put in the diced potatoes , water to cover and hit the white rice setting . Once I heard the water start boiling , I let it go for 10 minutes and then drained . Just be careful getting the pot out due to steam . This was great and we 're excited about being able to do this in the hot summer months when we need to boil something without heating up the entire house ! 	Rice Cooker
I have been used Aroma ARC-1266F Rice Cooker for about 3 months . It works pretty well . My wife also likes the nice-looking style . 	Rice Cooker
I had an AROMA rice maker , and it was ok , but this zojirushi is far , far better . No crusted bottom , and the rice is truly perfect . Very easy to use , very easy to clean and a perfect amount of rice for a two people household . Worth the money definitely . I have a zojirushi Breadmaker also and I am sold on this brand . Superior quality and performance in both appliances . 	Rice Cooker
It makes excellent rice , I 'll give it that . But after 3 years of relatively light use -LRB- It spent 8 months of that time in storage while I was searching for a permanent job -RRB- , the bottom is flaking . Not scratched , actively flaking . I used the scoop provided and most of the time , I just wiped the pot clean . Occasionally , I used dish soap -LRB- chemical-free -RRB- and a non-abrasive scouring pad when starchy residue built up . It made excellent rice and porridge , but now I 'm looking at dropping another $ 100 + on an appliance when it should have lasted longer . One of my Asian friends is still using her mom 's first Zojirushi and it 's 20 years old ! I absolutely ca n't recommend this rice cooker . 	Rice Cooker
The only reason this did n't earn a 5 star is that it takes SO LONG TO MAKE RICE . Now ... I know rice is rice , and there 's no quick and easy way to get it from the grain to the Chinese Box , but cooking two cups of this properly -LRB- meaning following instructions perfectly and letting it sit after cooking to allow the grains to finish puffing -RRB- takes an easy half an hour . I doubt there are inexpensive machines out there that can cook it faster , so I guess I could give it a 5 star for effort ... but overall , for a little cooker under $ 20 , we 've been VERY happy ! It 's nice to just throw in rice and water and let it sit til its finished ... no stirring or making sure the grains do n't burn . You wo n't be dissatisfied . I do n't leave many reviews here , but thought this could help as I did n't see others talking about this in their reviews . Enjoy ! 	Rice Cooker
I love this rice cooker . It 's easy to use , and rice stays fresh and warm for hours . Now , I can eat freshly cooked rice any time I want to . Since I purchased it a month ago , I have been practically eating rice 3 times a day -LRB- I am an Aisan -RRB- without gaining weight -LRB- like I would do with American food -RRB- . Yes , I am very happy with this rice cooker . 	Rice Cooker
This rice cooker is excellent . The rice comes out fluffy and seperate . Most importantly , delicious . Excellent choice . 	Rice Cooker
I bought this thinking it would take up so much less space on my counter top than the other model I had in mind . I got home to use it and was so disappointed until I read a comment someone else made about a review . It did sputter and spit and shoot rice water on my counter and the rice seemed to stick-the trick is to add a little butter or oil of your choice and a little salt . Now it works like a charm ! I usually add liquids and butter first , then the rice . I start it up an hour or two before I want to actually eat the rice , or even longer . I 've let it run for 3-4 hours before . It keeps the rice nice and warm all that time . I use this about every day-we love rice and I just started a gluten free diet so I 'm eating more rice instead of noodles . I 'm glad I checked the reviews after the initial disappointment . This one is a keeper . 	Rice Cooker
This is a very nice rice cooker . The 1st one I received - worked once , and then started burning the rice after that . Contacted Aroma customer support . Their representative was very cordial and helpful and instructed me to return the cooker since it was malfunctioning -LRB- the cooker screen displayed a `` C1 '' and the cooker would not turn off -RRB- . I returned to Amazon for replacement with no problems . The 2nd unit works great , and cooks brown rice excellently ! It does take longer than my previous rice cooker . Brown rice takes from 100 to 105 minutes to cook . It also requires less water than my previous cooker which was a surprise to me . I hope to cook many a cup of rice with this cooker -LRB- if it continues to function well -RRB- . 	Rice Cooker
Do NOT buy this hunk of junk . Mine worked great - for the first 12 times i used it . Then it stopped working . So i went to aroma with the warranty info and they were great in sending out a replacement , a week later . Or it WOULD have been great if the thing worked . On the first go , it did what the first pile-O-junk did - stopped working . Do n't waste your time or your money on this product . 	Rice Cooker
I used to have a Zojirushi rice cooker before it broke . This one is no were near that good with quality or the way it cooks rice . However for the price it is a great little rice cooker . Easy to clean and use . I would say the only real drawback is that is does tend to burn rice on the bottom of the pot if you do n't watch and stir occasionally . I usually end up adding a quarter cup of water or so with brown or white rice to avoid burning . Besides that works as advertised and you get what you pay for . 	Rice Cooker
I bought this item back in March 2010 and have used it a minimum of 3 times a week every single week since purchase . -LRB- My Wife Is Filipino -RRB- We have NEVER been disappointed with the quality of rice this cooker makes . We have also used it to make beef stew as a slow cooker and used it as a vegetable steamer also . It still makes rice the way it did when it was brand new . Even the non-stick coating on the 2 included pots is still fully intact and looks brand new . It 's operation has been flawless . The only thing you might have to make adjustments to as you use it is to learn the right amount of water to add to your uncooked rice to get the desired consistency you like . This is NOT a con but a learning curve . Now we make only make 3 cups of rice at a time 3 times a week . We do this because the rice sticks together after 24 to 36 hours and we like freshly cooked Jasmine rice whenever possible . The clean-up could n't be easier . The steam condensation is collected inside the cooker . Very Well Made . I HIGHLY Recommend This Item . 	Rice Cooker
Its so small that it will probably be good a for a serving for a 5yr old . . No exaggerations here ... size does matter 	Rice Cooker
I 've never owned a rice cooker before so I found this wonderful . I just dump in the rice and water and then push a button and ta da ! It works great for my family of 4 - makes just enough rice and is small enough that it does n't take up a lot of space in my kitchen cabinet . However , like the one star reviews say , it does stick to the bottom -LRB- we just soak overnight after using -RRB- and probably does n't produce the correct consistency for a rice connoisseur . But for a novice like me I found it a great addition to our kitchen ! 	Rice Cooker
I bought this model because of the `` titanium bowl , '' as I wanted to avoid teflon . It turns out , the bowl might be a teflon-titanium blend , it might be titanium with a teflon inner coating , it might be God knows what . I have had the rice cooker for three years and yes , it has been great . Until the bowl started flaking , like any other teflon bowl . If you see gold spots inside your bowl , then it 's flaking and you have to throw it out . The problem ? There is no replacement bowl to buy . I have been on the phone with Sanyo and various parts distributors all afternoon . The part -LRB- the inner bowl -RRB- has been back-ordered for 3 months and the parts distributors have not been able to get any information from Sanyo . I find that strange , considering they are still manufacturing this rice cooker !! So now , instead of spending $ 20 on a new bowl , I have to spend $ 100 + on a new rice cooker . Do you think it 's going to be another Sanyo ??? I do n't . But what to do about the darned teflon bowl that they all have . I might have to get a stainless steel model , and suck it up on the cleanup . Or maybe a Zojirushi , and I will just have to commit to buying a new bowl every year . At least you can buy a new bowl for those . 	Rice Cooker
This rice cooker is the best appliance I have I have had many rice cookers and this 1 does the job perfectly You ca n't go wrong with this 1 buy it now ! 	Rice Cooker
Had a rice cooker for years but it was getting as worn out as me so I tried this one and if I could replace me for what I did my rice cooker for what I did and have a good one as this I would . 	Rice Cooker
We love this rice cooker , it 's not so large and perfect for the two of us . Does fair job of brown rice if you let it soak for a while first . I recommend this rice cooker for a family of two or three . 	Rice Cooker
This is a Japanese brand , but product is made in China . So , ca n't expect the high quality that made there ... not to mention safety for your health . The cooking pot is heavy , which is good . The Teflon ? which is use , I ca n't say the same . I have the buy the Zojirushi NS-ZCC18 model , which is made in Japan with the quality that come with the high price . 	Rice Cooker
I love this rice cooker . It 's perfect for a single portion and so easy since it comes with a measuring cup and has lines to indicate water level . I 'm asian and grew up eating rice and this cooks it perfectly and fast . 	Rice Cooker
I have a bigger rice cooker but my house never need that much rice . So , I was searching for a smaller rice cooker . And I came across this little rice cooker . This must be smallest rice cooker I 've ever seen ! When I took it out of the box I could help but laugh because it so cute ! Anyway , this little rice cooker works very well . And give me just amount of cooked rice I need for my household with just two person here . The non-stick coating is great , very easy to clean . 	Rice Cooker
First it 's a good rice cooker , not expensive , do what it is supposed to do , and quicker than another rice cooker we have . Second it works also as a `` slow cooker '' in my home , and we are satisfied so far . Third , I like its transparent glass lid , easy to see through . So , recommend , esp . considering its relatively lower price tag . 	Rice Cooker
Had this rice cooker for two years . It recently died . I found the problematic part that needs to be replaced , but can not get replacement part from either manufacture or their service centers . Talked to them several time without finding any solution . Bad customer service and low quality product ! 	Rice Cooker
Bought this as a present . The recipient , early 20 's college student , loves the practicality , ease , and convenience . Perfect rice everytime . 	Rice Cooker
We have had this rice cooker for a month and have used it 4 times . I experienced none of the problems that a small number of reviews indicated . With that in mind , this is one of those things that performs so well that you wonder how it could be such a bargain . 	Rice Cooker
This worked for less than a month . I would n't buy another one of these . Sure hope B&D improves this product line . 	Rice Cooker
I bought a program called `` Delicious Library '' to run on my Mac . I wanted to inventory my book collection . I needed a bar code scanner to read the ISBN code on the books . I ordered this scanner - the wired handheld USB automatic laser barcode scanner reader with USB cable . It was delivered promptly and worked right out of the box with no problems . I am very satisfied and have used it for over a month again with zero issues or problems . 	Scanner
From the first time I used this printer , I should have known it was possessed . Every time I tried to print , it would spew out a blank page first -LRB- sort of like Linda Blair in the Exorcist -RRB- . If I did n't use it for a day or two , it would start printing cryptic things like photos without blue , graphics without green , or my personal favorite , black text without black -LRB- very hard to read -RRB- . To fix this required going through an elaborate ritual called `` head cleaning '' which involved flushing huge amounts of ink into the nether world -LRB- it must collect somewhere inside the machine , but there should be about 6 gallons in there by now -RRB- . Finally after a year of light use , it prints only blank sheets with random globs of liquid black ink . I keep waiting for them to spell out `` obey me '' or `` kill them all '' or something , but so far they just look like squashed beetles . The best thing about this printer is that it was almost free , since when I bought it Epson was offering a $ 30 Visa gift card rebate , and they sent me three over a two month period . I even e-mailed and told them they had sent me too many , but they never replied , so I used them without guilt . Maybe they were feeling guilty about selling such a piece of absolute garbage . DO NOT BUY THIS DEMONIC MACHINE ! As Bobby Bare says in that old country song : `` Since there ai n't no zero , I give you a 1 ! '' 	Scanner
This all in one printer was a great buy ! It was easy to put together and easy to install . I was concerned about installing the software on my Mac but it was not a problem . 	Scanner
We are past and current owners of Microtek scanners . Presently we are using a Microtek E6 on a Macintosh Quadra 950 . I purchased the Hewlett Packard ScanJet 4200C , at a higher price than the Microtek scanners presently available , for our new Windows 98 PC computer . Frankly , HP has a lot to learn about sharp and knock your socks off scanning . They should give Microtek a call . Also , their auto scanning quality is good for the kids projects , but lacking in quality for professionals who need to use the scanned images in graphics for printing . The scanner wo n't turn off and it is a matter of time before I will have to track down a bulb for it . Personally , I would like the opportunity to trade this inadequate scanner for the cheaper , Microtek . 	Scanner
I 've had the Epson 810 for a few weeks . Originally I had a photo printer hooked up to a print server and a separate fax . The Epson 810 replaced this entire setup . The fax and scanner are excellent . Print quality is superb . 	Scanner
As a photo printer , this has proven to be an excellent choice . The quality of the prints has been outstanding , and setting it up was very easy . As a scanner , it is a bit slower than I would like . However , it does a very good job . Scanning in old household papers , I found that it managed to capture fairly faint test from some handwritten documents . Overall , we are very pleased with the C3180 . 	Scanner
I was looking for a home all in one product to connect to Ubuntu . Linux computer . Checked the HP LP-LIP site for a list of supported devices and HP 's site to see which were currently offered and found this C3180 to appear to be the best match . So I bought the box - took it home and downloaded latest HP-LIP package . The software self installed very easily on Ubuntu Feisty 7.04 ! Both printing and scanning worked first time and seamlessly for all users configured on the PC . I have not tested all features exhaustively yet - but I was very impressed by the ease of getting this compact unit to work with a Linux environment - I have had more trouble installing under XP with other hardware ! So anyone needing a compact home all in one for Linux - give this one a try . 	Scanner
Scan snap is incredible . It is the gateway to becoming paperless . Sign up for Evernote , purchase Scan Snap , scan all of your paper into Evernote using scan snap , and throw away the paper ! Evernote makes all of the text in your scans searchable . Scan snap can index the text in the pdf files it makes as well , but evernote does this after , which makes the scanner go faster . Since you very rarely need the original copy of the paper you keep , scan snap and evernote are a much better alternative to paper folder and a file cabinet . All of your scanned images are searchable in Evernote , so I can call up anything i have scanned , and find it in seconds ! No more paper piles , no more filing , this changed my life ! 	Scanner
I LOVE this small scanner . It is very portable , scans books , pictures and other documents that you could not or would not like to place in a traditional scanner . Color or black\/white option . You purchase and insert the micro SD card of your choice . When you plug it into your computer , it acts like a small hard drive and you search pictures on it easily . Wonderful device for getting scans of all those family history items that ca n't leave someone 's home , the library or repository . I would buy it again in a heartbeat ! 	Scanner
The GiiNii scanner lived up to it 's description . Upon opening the package I scanned over 1500 photos when my parents visited and it worked great ! For the price , you ca n't beat it ! 	Scanner
We purchased this printer because of its promise of high quality printing . When it prints , it does a fair job , as good as any other printer in this category . But , it 's very finicky . Many misprints and paper jams . Seems to be extremely sensitive to the type of paper used . It 's also difficult to print forms on this printer -LRB- such as labels and business cards -RRB- as it often does not align properly . Ink is often smeared . Other features seem to work okay . The network capability is great - but there are so many new networkable printers coming out that I would hardly call this unique . Overall , an okay printer if you 're willing to baby-sit it . 	Scanner
The case is a solidly constructed with enough space for the scanner and corresponding cable and then a little more . I love it looks like it will last a long time . 	Scanner
I purchased this printer for my home office for light business and personal use . The set up was extremeley easy . All you do is enter your network key in the printer for your wireless network and put the install disk in and within 5 minutes you are printing . The quality of the documents & photos is great and this printer is quick . I read a review where someone thought the printing was noisy . I do not feel it loud at all . The only critisism is the lid - it is flimsy but the rest of the printer is solid . You can not beat the quality for the price of this printer . I would highly recommend . 	Scanner
The pen rarely is accurate . The pen does not link to the computer well when working in word . I have to go over the line four or five times to get it to read in word . The desktop application is not very user friendly . When attempting to replace the batteries , the pen did not take the AAA batteries I used . Both the batteries that came with it and the ones I replaced them with were duracell , and the replcement batteries did not fit . They were too small . I had to squeeze the back of the unit to get power and then it did not stay on . Overall , I thought the pen was not worth the money and is virtually useless . 	Scanner
I use this scanner primarily to listen to FIRE\/EMS frequencies . Programming is a little time consuming , but once its done you 're all set . I like that you have a choice of antennas and power sources and that this scanner does n't take up much room wherever you choose to use it . 	Scanner
Nice looking , compact printer , makes clean , crisp copies . Attention Mac Lion Users : Before you add the Epson printer to your Print and Scan preferences , delete any existing printer -LRB- s -RRB- you 've previously installed , otherwise the Epson wo n't install . 	Scanner
I bought this scanner 6 months ago to replace a . . scanner that just wore out . After scanning one picture the computer lost the scanner . I would reinstall , scan one picture and lose it . The tech support was worthless they told me to unplug my other USB stuff , then they told me to reinstall the software , which was tough . No change . I bought a new computer with XP pre-loaded this machine can not find the scanner . What a hunk of junk ! 	Scanner
This is an incredible scanner . The capabilities go far beyond most of the competition . Epson should however be embarrassed by the included software , and whoever made the recommendation and final decision should be fired . The functionality and UI are both so bad as to make them unusable except for the simplest tasks . Not what I expect from a scanner in this price range . 	Scanner
This scanner is great for long sheets of paper . Does n't do the little stuff like gas , food , etc. . Sent back for a scanner that does the smaller pieces of paper . Otherwise , for large sheets this scanner is great ! 	Scanner
If you have Windows 7 beware ! I changed to Epson because the print heads on my HP printer went out after 15 months , so after reading all these great reviews thought I 'd try the Epson Artisan 730 . Got it a couple of weeks ago and set it up and it appeared to be pretty simple ; one of the first steps was for it to check for updated drivers which I did . Since I 've been busy , all I did between then and today was print , which it did fine . Today I tried to scan items and it wo n't scan to my PC . Get a message , `` Epson Scan has stopped working . A problem caused the program to stop working correctly . Windows will close the program and notify you if a solution is available ; '' must not have been available because I did n't get a notification . Uninstalled and reinstalled and now get message , `` This version of Windows is not supported by Epson Scan . '' What the heck ? Tried again ; same thing . Started Googling and discover there is a known issue with Windows 7 and on some obscure part of the Epson site it said to download their program there & not use the CD provided with the product . Did what they said and guess what , still can not scan to my PC nor do I have the Epson icon or access to the Epson Event Manager to change settings . Have sent a message to Epson for help -- but come on , this is supposed to be a simple to install printer . Way too much hassle and time wasted for this product and am having serious regrets about purchasing it . 	Scanner
I have owned this printer since August 06 , and bought it reluctantly because of the problems described here , but I need a front paper loader and I have had very good luck with HP in the past . So I compromised and bought Staples ' extended warantee , which I normally never do . So now , January 07 , when I got the `` out of paper '' message with the tray full , I thought ` uh-oh , here 's the problem everyone was complaining about . ' However , it turned out that there was a paper jam . Removing the back panel , and carefully removing the paper stuck inside seems to have cleared the problem -LRB- with my fingers crossed -RRB- . Other things I do n't like are that the startup time to print one page seems extraordinarily long , and it goes into ` maintainence mode ' much more often than I would expect -LRB- although I could give it that one if it kept it trouble free -RRB- . I also had trouble printing my Christmas address labels , which printed fine on my old HP , but I ruined one page of labels because it printed low on the page . I had to manually cut 1\/4 '' off the top of the label pages to get it positioned correctly . It also ` notches ' the top of the paper occasionally . So even though the quality of prints , copies , and scans is very good , I would think twice before buying this again -LRB- although if it were still the best looking front loader around , I might go with it -RRB- .

This product was first shipped with styrofoam residue on the INSIDE of the case ... this caused spots on all of my pictures . <p> But Amazon was very quick at replacing the defective product . On second try , I found the 2400x2400 dpi resolution to be so much more than was necessary that I was shocked . My experience with inferior products worried me about buying anything less . At 2400 , you could probably make highway billboard posters without any added granualarity ! <p> As for speed , the scanning rate is very quick for 400dpi and less . The software included on the CD-ROm facilitates productive work . Perhaps the biggest surprise for me was how powerful , precise and quick the photo negative\/slide scanner is ! This feature kept me from returning it . It , too has nice editing tools in the software and integrates well with Adobe products . <p> If I were to buy over again , I would downgrade to the 4400 series . 	Scanner
The Good : Scans quickly , software is easy to use , very portable . The Bad : A bit tempermental , does not always recognize a sheet to be scanned , jams easily and multiple scans need to be hand fed . wee bit pricey . Overall : Better than the flatbed scanner\/printer combo . 	Scanner
I bought this product to help me with note taking for my Master 's . I was very disappointed in it . The pen itself feels very flimsy . It DOES NOT come with a standard USB cable , instead it comes with a cable that has a male end that looks like it should plug into a phone or other mobile device . This cable also has a spur that comes out of it with a female end that will accept an external hard drive cable -LRB- the one page directions did show the pen with a standard USB cable -RRB- . The software was fairly straight forward to load . The installation process put an icon in my taskbar and a shortcut on my desktop . When I clicked on the shortcut it told me that another instance of the program was running and that I should uninstall it and then restart the scanning program . It took me awhile to figure out that it was refering to the instance of the program running in my taskbar . After that I just ignored the desktop shortcut . I then connected the scanner pen to my laptop and attempted to scan . Nothing happened . I realized that my icon in the taskbar was n't showing the pen connected . The only way I could get the pen to connect was to right click on the icon and select a setting . This connected the pen but I still was n't scanning . I could n't get the scanner light to come on at all . I then uninstalled and reloaded the scanning program with all of the same results . I contacted Ectaco through email and explained my steps and the results that I was having with their product . After 3 working days of no response from technical service I sent the item back to Amazon . I 've heard really good things about this device , not just from the reviews here but other students who have successfully used it . I want to believe that I just got a defective product -LRB- it happens -RRB- but the total absence of a response from technical support , the non standard USB cable , and the software quirks all add up to the one star review .

I bought this as a gift but the recipient is truly pleased and uses this product every day . 	Scanner
If you are running vista , save your money ! Do not buy this scanner !!! Tech support will get it to print to their crappy software , but your computer will not recognize the driver . You will not be able to use it with any purchased software . 	Scanner
I deliberated a while before getting this scanner , comparing reviews for other Epson and Canon scanners . So far I am really impressed . Have used it mainly to scan 6x6 and 4x5 negs and trannies , also positive images . Really happy with the results . The only limitation to resolution is my internal memory . The Epson , Silverlight and Abbyy OCR software - all of which are included - are impressive . Both the Epson and Silverlight take a little tweaking - I have not yet fully fathomed all they may be capable of . I love this scanner . 	Scanner
I am amazed at the many things this scanner does . The product is wonderful . The instruction sheet needs improvement . Some features could be better explained . 	Scanner
I researched multiple scanners in -LRB- this -RRB- price range before finally purchasing the 1250 photo . My primary use was scanning for the Web , so the 48-bit , 1200x2400 resolution fit perfectly -LRB- Web supports 72dpi - scan at hi-res then resize -RRB- into my plans . I 've used both the 35mm neg adapter and the slide film adapter and they both perform flawlessly -LRB- although the negs seem to turn out better -RRB- . The `` dust '' mentioned above is true although it is actually a fog under the glass that I 've seen before in certain scanners . My guess is that it 's a result of step taken -LRB- or not taken -RRB- in production . I sent Epson an email inquiring about it and they told me that I can take it in to an authorized retailer for repair . I thought of opening it up -LRB- negating my warrant -RRB- and cleaning it myself but I honestly can not see it showing up in my scans . The neg\/slide adapter pushes the scan down a couple of inches , missing the fog . The only re-touching I do in Photoshop is for minor dust specs that reside on the front of the glass . -LRB- ... -RRB- ... <p> All-in-all this is a great little scanner for the money - the fog is a minor detail . The final result is perfect for my medium . 	Scanner
I needed a scanner to be able to connect original docs for business records , and this was a simple fix to my needs . Reasonably priced for a portable scanner . Small enough to go anywhere , and easy enough to use that I can take it to meetings and out in the field . A number of other users warn about following the directions for installation , and they mean it . Do not plug in the unit before you install the software . I followed the instructions and had no problems whatsoever . I was able to start scanning docs in minutes . I am very pleased with this product . 	Scanner
This scanner comes with a fully functioning Adobe Photoshop Elements 2.0 CD and the scanner is less costly than the software alone . <p> Regarding the scanner itself , I purchased the scanner to digitize many photographs and documents . The image quality seems to be good . The scanner is powered by the USB connection so there is no external power cord . The speed is n't great but its sufficient for my needs . <p> The scanner has a really great feature called multiscan which is its strongest and weakest feature . This allows you to put more than one photo in the scanner and the scanner scans in each photo into a separate JPG file . When this works it is awesome . Unfortunately about 25 % of the time it ca n't find the edges of the photos correctly and the result is that you have to scan the photos separately . <p> I also like the ability of being able to scan to PDF for documents .

woah , 1999 called . . and wants it out dated scanning tool back . - I do n't even know where I have this damned thing . I know I do n't have any of the cameras anymore . WHEN I did have the cameras , and this little doo-hicky , it worked like a charm though . I think I was under the guise of . . OOH LOOKY ! SMALL AND CUTE ! . Do they even still make these ?? 	Scanner
This thing is awesome ! Perfect for a desk or a laptop bag ! Very portable and easy to install . I like the fact that it is USB powered . 	Scanner
Really slow , low quality , crappy software and no power switch . And good luck getting technical support ! My emails got bounced and I could not get through on the phone . Oh , and Epson offers you a `` free '' web space to post your photos ... I read the fine print and it says that you lose your rights to pictures you post ! Epson can claim your photos as its own and use them without even acknowledging you , let alone compensating you . So here 's the summary : bad product , bad service , and they try to take your photos for themselves ! 	Scanner
This printer was the deal of the day , and needing a printer for school , I decided to buy it . Only $ 60 ! I never one regret the buy . It 's a fantastic printer , easy to set up to a wireless network , as well as to print\/scan\/copy . Does exactly what I need it to do , plus more . I have a laptop with 64-bit Win 7 and I believe on the 64-bit , the drivers on the installation CD do n't work properly . So I had to go online to the Epson website and download the correct drivers . Was n't a problem at all . Very pleased with the purchase , especially as a deal of the day . 	Scanner
We needed a document scanner for our 7-person small business . Given the choice , I would never buy this again , nor any other Epson product . - By far the biggest problem is the scanning through the Automatic Document Feeder . The resulting PDF pages have a big , white border around the edges -LRB- corresponding to about 3-5mm -RRB- , and the pages are often skewed . I had the purchased unit replaced , same problem with the second unit . Compared to a fax or a photocopy , that 's fine . Compared to any other self-respecting scanner , like the Canon this replaces , that 's awful . Really awful . It makes business documents look like post-digestive system biological waste material . Worst thing about it is that it 's a fundamental design flaw . - As mentioned in another review here , the scanning software -LRB- Epson Scan -RRB- only allows one instance of it to be running on the local network . Having mulled that over for a while , it makes sense that only one person can be scanning at a time . But on the other hand , I 'd rather be able to have the program running and just lock the scanner to my computer -LRB- and have it unlock either manually , or automatically after a period of inactivity -RRB- . - Does n't come with any OCR software . For this price , it damn well should . - The network card really is n't of any use , which makes the price premium over the GT-2500 vomit-worthy . Should have got the cheaper one and shared it through a standalone computer connected by USB . Damn . - The network configuration utility -LRB- EpsonNet Config -RRB- is buggy on a Mac . Had to configure the IP address through Windows , as it refused to run `` Could not find the files required to run the application . '' Support could n't figure it out either . - Support is pretty awful . If the unit is defective , they expect you to take the unit to one of the Epson `` Care '' -LRB- sigh -RRB- centers . So , not only is the unit defective and expensive , you should eat the cost of the fuel and salary to get it fixed - like it would be so difficult for a large multi-national corporation to arrange for shipping labels . Also , you have the usual jumping through multiple Indian hoops before going around the world back to our doorstep in Long Beach CA . Stick to HP . Giving Epson a chance was a mistake . 	Scanner
This product seems to be a godsend for our office . We have a lot of paper , and we get more in here every day . The Scan Snap very quickly will scan both sides of the paper -LRB- faster than your average laser printer can print them out -RRB- . It creats pdf files from these that are easy to move around and rename to fit your organization 's organization . THe only problem that we have been having is that paper often misfeeds . It tends to pull the paper in one direction and then jams . Clearing jams is easy and quick , but it is still a bit annoying . Overall , this is a great product and I would highly recommend it for any office to help in digitizing . It also makes a great system for scanning documents to send via email . 	Scanner
Pros : Lots of functions , excellent BW and Color quality . Solid small business machine and a bit faster wireless printing than the specs claim . When it 's proved itself for a few months , I 'll amend my review . Cons : The cartridges are bit pricey , but still within the average range for laser printers . If the quality holds up , I 'd say it 's well worth it . Note : I did read numerous reviews on All-in-one laser printers before buying this one . This Canon ImageClass had more positives for the price and I paid just $ 399 + free shipping . Canon packaged this printer very securely , too , so it ships very well from the vendor . 	Scanner
This scanner worked wonders the first day I used it . I scanned about 200 pages that all turned out nicely . There were a few jams but were easy to fix . The second day everything went to pot . There is a little rubber pad that keeps the pages going straight . This part stopped doing its job after about 60 pages and then everything went squeegee . I went to the Xerox support website that offers replacement parts . They did n't have the part ! I then contacted Office Max where I had ordered it and they no longer have the part ! All they could do was send a whole new scanner to replace mine . I checked google for the part and found it costs over $ 35 to replace ! This is n't worth the hassle . It 's too bad because the scanner looks nice on my desk and does a very nice job until the part goes out . 	Scanner
If what you want is a scanner for home use without expecting bells and whistles , this is your solution . It is dependable , produces good colors , and has helped me throw out a bunch of written stuff that was cluttering my filing space . I have also had time to scan my wedding pictures that were taken when digital photography did not exist . Now I have them in my computer and they do n't look faded anymore . 	Scanner
We purchased the HP Officejet Pro 8600 Plus printer to replace a Lexmark printer . The quality of the printer when printing documents is great . The issue is that it will not print envelopes in MS Word 2007 . HP lists this as a `` known problem '' and offers a solution that did not work . Amazon should list all of the `` known problem '' so that you can make an educated decision about if you want to buy this product . We are very dissatisfied with this purchase ! 	Scanner
I had been building a ` Keeper Bin ' in what was a laundry basket of all my ` Keeper ' type documents . One weekend with this puppy , and it is all digitized . - Sensitive information to local PDFs - Everything else to Evernote . All I can say now , is that this device will be a permanent part of my Bill\/Record keeping process . I can not reccommend this device enough . It is not as fast as the more higher-priced models , but ti is small , and gets the job done . Perfect size for the desk where I park my laptop on occasion . I use a 2011 MBP with OSX 10.7.2 on it , drivers\/software work perfectly . Would like some more automated PDF naming options however . 	Scanner
Bought this printer for $ 99 . The printer is nice except you can not print on the lowest quality print setting . If you do the type is unreadable . When I first got this printer I printed about 20 pages for work at the lowest print setting to save ink , after the printer spit out the 20 pages I was amazed that many of the words were too light and garbled to read . Why make this setting if it does n't work ? Printing on `` standard '' print works just fine and is clear . Wireless , making copyies , and scanning , work well on this unit with no complaints . My only other problem with the Epson 545 is that I ran out of black ink and the machine refused to let me do any other job on it . I needed to fax one page to a client but because I was out of black ink it would just give me an error message when trying to do any other non-printing job . I called Epson technical support and they told me until I replace the ink cartridge I am out of luck . Could you imagine if yout car ran out of windshield washer fluid and then your heat and radio would not work ? Kind of a stupid design caused by the greed to make people buy ink regardless . So ... just make sure you always have extra ink on hand , and never print on the lowest qualtiy print setting and you will be fine . I still have an old Cannon Pixma that lets me refill the ink cartridges and has no chip that counts the number of pages I print . Those were the good old days . I needed the Epson for wireless printing and scanning so it is what it is . 	Scanner
I already owned a scanner from Visioneer . But my father was moving and wanted to throw away hundreds of slides that he had . When my brother and I were very young , my father got into take slides . These slides have a lot of memories that I wanted to save and digitize so I went shopping for a new scanner that could scan slides . I decided that instead of spending money on a specialized film & slide scanner that I would purchase a flatbed that had an adapter . I compared the Microtek 4800 to an HP model and came home with the Microtek . <p> Plug it in , everything went smooth . First things I noticed were the faster speed and much better image quality than my Visioneer 7200 . I was happy to make the purchase . But then , I went to original task at hand . I pulled out a slide and gave it a shot . THE MOST HORRIBLE IMAGE QUALITY I HAVE EVER SEEN . The same thing goes for the negative film too . If you are looking to scan slides and film , invest in a good one . I sold my self short by being cheap and buying a scanner with this adapter . <p> I still like the scanner , but for positive scanning only . The OCR function works great . I wish it had a fax feature though . The power button issue is not a problem for me because I have a switched surge protector under my monitor that allows me to switch off\/on peripherals at my desire . <p> ... 	Scanner
HP has lost their way , I am an outdoor and wild life photographer and have uesd HP Photosmarts -LRB- seven of them -RRB- over the last 15 years . Been on the phone to East India and Canada for months trying to get quality prints . Now they tell me I ca n't use their best Vivera inks with their best 11.5 mil paper , The last straw , gave my new Photosmart away and went with the Epson Artisan 835 as reccommended by an old friend at Office Depot . I am blown away with the quality , detail and colors of this printer . I may get rid of my HP 13x19 as well : Larry 	Scanner
Installation This printer was extremely easy to connect to my wireless network and install on my computer . It detected my wireless network immediately . I just had to enter in my password and insert the CD in my computer to install the software . The ink cartridges were also very easy to install . This Epson does seem to be slightly larger than other all-in-ones I have had in the past , but that was n't such a big deal for me but it also comes with benefits such as a very large paper tray , and a rear tray for specialty papers . There is also a USB port conveniently located on the front of the printer so you can store scanned documents to it or print\/copy from the usb . Printing Printing is extremely fast and the quality is excellent . It prints 2 sided by just checking a box in the printer settings which is great to save paper on larger documents . The 2 sided printing is extremely fast . I 've used other printers before that take forever when using 2-sided but this is not the case with this printer . There is also another tray in the back to store special paper such as photo paper or envelopes . The color quality , whether its a photo , or a business document is very good and looks professional . One thing I have not setup yet is the ability to print from my Android phone -LRB- also works with iPhones -RRB- . There is another neat feature that will let you email a document or attachment to the printer using the printers unique email address . The ink cartridges is special formula by Epson which is supposed to reduce the smudging of your documents . This technology does seem to work as I have not had any issues with smudging , even when I printed something with various colors that covered 75 % of the page . As for the noise level , I would n't consider it noisy , but I do n't think its quiet either . Its certainly acceptable given the price of it . Auto Document Feeder The ADF can handle up to 30 pages and works great when scanning or copying several pages of documents . It makes scanning\/copying\/faxing so much easier and faster . Scanning The scanning feature of this printer is fantastic . Right from the printer , you can select to scan it to a PDF . There are 3 scan options -LRB- scan to pc , scan to pdf , and scan to email -RRB- . My favorite is the scan to PDF because I like to have documents on a PDF . I just have to place my documents in the ADF , select scan to PDF and click start . The document is then transferred and saved automatically to my PC -LRB- via wireless -RRB- and done so very quickly . I like not having to convert the file and that it saves it to a PDF for me automatically . By choosing the other options , you can save it as another file type . Copying The copy feature makes perfect copies of everything I have copied and the speed is quick . I have copied color documents , B&W documents , receipts , etc. . . Everything I have copied has come out very clear . Faxing This all in one also has a fax which works very well . I like that I can fax a document directly from PC which allows me to fax wherever I am in my house , but also saves me from having to print and then manually fax it . The fax software was very easy to use and it includes a built in cover sheet if you need one . LCD Display The LCD display on the front of the printer allows you to access all the various functions of the printer and to view\/change the setup options . It is very easy to navigate around the display . Overall I am very pleased with this printer and highly recommend it . If you are in the market for an all in one printer that is loaded with features , than you will love this printer . I have used Kodak , HP , and Lexmark all in ones prior to using this Epson Workforce and this one is by far the best , not just in print quality and features , but also in ease of use and installation .

Bought this to replace my Canon LiDE35 which would not run in Windows 7 environment . Was not completely sure from the on-line description whether the LiDE110 was Windows 7 compatible but it is . Not blazing fast but not advertized to be so . I especially like the direct `` Copy '' feature that obviates using a separate utility for this -LRB- my main use of a scanner is as a copier as my printer is not a `` 3-in-one '' . 	Scanner
Please do not waste your money . I have had one for 2 years and have reloaded the software to make it work at least 30 times . 	Scanner
I had 3 HP printers -LRB- all-in-ones -RRB- and they all died within about 6 months of each other -LRB- after very little use , I might add -RRB- , so I was ready to find another manufacturer who had a better quality product ... I found it in the Epson printer . Set up is a breeze with this all-in-one printer\/copier\/scanner \/ fax -- just follow the step-by-step instructions and it 's up and running . The print quality is good and the speed is very fast . Faxing and copying are so easy . The LCD screen is bright and easy to read , and the touch pad is a real plus . I 've printed over 100 pages already and the ink use seems very conservative -LRB- meaning I wo n't have to change the cartridges too often -RRB- . The only negative thing I can think to say about the Epson is that the paper trays are lightweight plastic and feel somewhat flimsy . But even after changing paper sizes and reloading the paper about 5 times already , I 've not had any problem with the trays . I would definitely recommend this all-in-one ! 	Scanner
This is easily the worst printer I 've ever owned . I tried to use it on my Macintosh network through the Airport connected by USB . I tried to connect it directly to one of my computers through USB . It did n't make a difference on the setup , which basically only does about half of what 's advertised . Even after downloading the latest drivers , the scanner was nearly useless . My 5-year-old $ 100 flatbed did a better job and had more features . The ink cartridges last for 70-90 pages . I 'm on my 6th or 7th one in 3 months , and tired of the Office Max people knowing me by name . I got this for free as part of an Apple promotion , and still feel like I got ripped off . 	Scanner
I have an extensive I.T. background , working helpdesk and tech support for various organizations over the last 5 years . I have installed and uninstalled hundreds of printers , mostly because it is usually so easy to do . In fact , I 've \* always \* recommended HP products to all my clients because they are so simple , reliable , and essentially ubiquitous . <p> Not so for this printer ! I have spent , and this is no exaggeration , the better part of 5 work days on the phone with tech support \* just trying to install the printer \* . Whereas some people can install with no problem , when there is a problem , it is catastrophic . Installation issues include : <p> \* Having to install the drivers -LRB- all 450 MB of them -RRB- multiple times ; according to their support site , HP tells you some machines require multiple installations before they work . WHAT ? <p> \* An installation program that crashes with no error or warning . Suddenly , it 's just gone , and nothing 's actually been installed . Or , of course , there 's my favorite : An error message that 's simply a blank pop up window . Pretty tough to address that one . <p> \* An uninstall procedure that 's 4-steps deep . That 's right -- you have to run their uninstaller FOUR TIMES , and each iteration takes longer than the last . Be prepared , if you call tech support , to uninstall OVER AND OVER AGAIN , and repeat the same process OVER AND OVER AGAIN . <p> When you call a tech support line and their first idea to address why the install program does n't work is to update the drivers for your USB ports on a machine that 's only 6 months old , they 're fishing for answers , but nothing 's biting . AVOID THIS PRINTER AT ALL COSTS ! Sure it 's cheap , but that 's because it does n't work very well !!!!!! 	Scanner
One problem after another ... mostly due to the Wi-Fi connection . We frequently have to go through the Add a Printer wizard via Control Panel to get the printer to function . The scanner has not opertated from day 1 . We use Dell Inspiron 1520 laptops running Window Vista . I would not recommend purchasing the computer , the HP product , or the operating system . None are ready for prime time . 	Scanner
I am very pleased with this scanner . Easy to install and no problems scanning from pictures , to documents . I like the fact that I didnt need to buy an all in one . As it is much more reasonable price for this . 	Scanner
Linux users looking for a great , cheap film scanner need look no further . Colors look great from negative film , and the scanning utility is stable . There are a few `` cons '' : - Some noise and banding is visible when scanning severely overexposed negatives or in some very bright highlights at 2400 DPI or higher . I shot a whole role of 400 speed film with my meter set at 100 - oops ! - It is not a fast scanner at 2400 DPI , where I scan negatives . - The Linux driver works great , but needs to be downloaded and installed according to the directions found here : Overall , it is a wonderful scanner - the perfect choice for the broke photo-hobbyist , especially if that person happens to run Linux . I do n't know if any other film-capapble scanner is Linux friendly , but the Epson brand is very well supported ! 	Scanner

Do you like to buy expensive ink all the time ? Do you enjoy extremely water-soluble inks -LRB- even a slight amount of humidity or perspiration on your hands will easily cause your printed work to smudge away -RRB- ? This product is deceptive . On the outside it looks nice , it is loaded with useful features such as a high-quality scanner and nice looking prints at an affordable every day low price . However do not be deceived . This product is inferior to previous HP printers I have owned , it seems they are abandoning their commitment to high quality for high profits through the use of cheap water-soluble inks -LRB- e.g. rubs off extremely easily -RRB- provided to the consumer at low amounts and high prices . You were warned from one unhappy HP customer . 	Scanner
I got this for my father who is n't the MOST computer savvy person in the world . Fortunately I was there to help him set it up ... and then scan all his slides ... This is the least user friendly piece of equipment I 've ever used . If you plan on getting this for someone older who may not be the greatest with computers , keep on looking . Scan quality is pretty good , internal memory is VERY small , so you can only scan a few slides at a time . Overall , I ca n't say that I can wholeheartedly recommend this product . Not to mention the price you pay for something that , once you 're done scanning all your slides , becomes a very expensive paperweight . \*\* EDIT \*\* 04\/2012 Dropped rating from 3 stars to 1 . This scanner overexposes . Slides , when viewed with the naked eye with a bright white background behind the slide , appear crisp and full of detail . This scanner washes all of that away . It 's a real shame . Please heed my warning and do NOT purchase this scanner . 	Scanner
The scanner is fine-takes a little getting used to , as I had a different model that did a little more before . But it bit the dust and I could not afford to replace it . The greatest part was getting this scanner through Amazon . Husband lost his higher paying job last year , so things are tight with the new budget and Amazon has been a big help . I use my Amazon card for nearly all necessary monthly items , gas , professional fees and dues , etc and the rewards I get help me purchase items not in the budget . I got an Amazon gift card from the National Association of Realtors for taking part in a survey and , by watching the prices , got the scanner on clearance for only a few dollars out of pocket . That makes it a great scanner . So , while I may only be giving the scanner 4 stars , I give Amazon rewards program 51\/2 stars . 	Scanner
Printing is fast for an inkjet printer . Print quality is very good . Color is bright and true . The scanner is good . The size of the scanned pdf file was larger than from Paperport . The image to pdf conversion is slower . Overall workflow is also slower . Software installation on a Vista computer is a breeze . The wireless functions worked perfectly . The Amazon price is very attractive . 	Scanner
I have a new MacBook Pro running Leopard 10.5.2 and the DS Mobile 600 scanner works perfectly for scanning documents , receipts etc. . Instead of using an application like Preview or Adobe Acrobat , I am using free programs like ` Yep ' or something inexpensive -LRB- -LRB- $ 30 -RRB- like ` Receipt Wallet ' and ` Document Wallet ' . ` Yep ' has the advantage of easily cropping out any black background from documents less than 81\/2 X 11 as well as being able to ` tag ' the document for easy keyword retrieval later . Also , in response to another reader 's comment , I am easily able to store the USB cable in the provided carrying case along with the scanner . 	Scanner
This printer has very few redeeming qualities . It worked as it should for the first few months I had it -LRB- have owned it for 6 years -RRB- , but developed numerous problems after only 6 months . It jams up frequently , has trouble even taking paper from the paper feed unless I literally help feed it in , the scanner and copier work sometimes but not others -LRB- what fixes this or causes the problem is hard to determine -RRB- , and here 's the worst thing : it will stop working completely at times , saying it does n't recognize the color cartridge -LRB- the problem that seems to be most common for owners of this printer -RRB- . The ONLY solution I 've found that is at all reliable is to completely reinstall the software . Easy enough if you still have the disk , but also a huge pain in the butt . Look here HP Support website -- -RRB- -LRB- ... -RRB- for downloading new software\/drivers , etc. . I just reinstalled the software with this for the 5th time since the original installation , and now everything seems to be working perfectly , including scanning and copying . Still , I would bet that my printer will once again become possessed within the next 6 months , and I 'll have to reinstall the software again . TLDR : This printer is TERRIBLE , and unless you like frequently reinstalling the software , you should definitely get a different machine . 	Scanner
"Pros : Straight forward set up . Good directions . Good print quality . Control panel was intuitive . Good that Epson included full ink cartridges . Overall a good product . Cons : My Artisan 810 had a defective document feeder out of the box .

I 'm using c-pen 3.5 to scan text from books written in English and in Polish -LRB- lots of additional diacritic signs so challenging for any OCR -RRB- on a Macbook pro with Snow Leopard system . For that purpose and on that system cpen 3.5 works just great . When its connected to the USB its very fast and accurate . When it is connected via bluetooth it works bit slower and with some errors but still with impressive quality . Its true that it doesnt recognize underlined text very well but beside that I didnt notice many problems . I was using it also when book was on my knees and accuracy was bit worse then . I had some problems at the begining as I couldnt switch the default language to Polish but I was helped by support and they fixed the problem in 24h by giving me line of code to write in the terminal and that fixed the bug in the software . I was told that they are going to fix that in next version of software . Installation and pairing with bluetooth could be more intuitive from the point of view of macuser . I cant switch of the sound of succesfull scan which of course can be eliminated by turning of system sound but its a bit annoying . But other than that the product does all I need . So far worth its price . 	Scanner
I love this scanner . The best features are : 1 . I 've scanned hundreds of photos and it never would have been possible without the multi-scan feature . You can lay 3-4 photos on the scanning bed and the multi-scan feature will save them as separate image files and even straighten them for you . The only problem is that if you lay a photo at the ver top of the scanning bed , it gets cut off , so that you have to leave about an inch of empty space at the top . Occasionally it will detect two photos as one and you will need to rescan - but this can usually be avoided by making sure the photos do n't lie too close together 2 . It is so slim and can live on my desk without making it look cluttered . If you do n't have space on your desk , it is lightweight and slim enough to store in a nearby closet without being too much of a hassle . 3 . You do n't need to plug it into an outlet , just a USB port - this is great for 2 reasons : the first is that power strips are usually so crowded with plugs , it is one less thing to have to jam in there , and also if you are storing it in a closet you do n't have to get behind your desk to plug it in . The second is probably not important to everyone , but we live overseas right now , and it 's nice to know that when we move back we wo n't need to buy any kind of plug adaptor or converter to keep using it . 4 . The software that comes with is handy and simple to set up and lets you select a file name that it gives to each file in the whole group you just scanned as a base name and attaches a 1,2,3 , etc after the name . Maybe all scanning software does this , but I find that very handy for organizing my files . When I scan , I 'm not usually in the biggest rush , I just scan while I 'm doing other things so i do n't pay too much attention to how fast it scans , but I think it 's about a minute to scan a bed full of photos -LRB- 3-4 depending on photo size -RRB- . Overall , a great purchase and I would definitely recommend . 	Scanner
I did n't think it was possible to do a competent all-in-one that is also a good photo printer . But I think this is it . Very easy setup -LRB- including wireless networking -RRB- -- I think it took 1\/2 hour . On the photo side , it uses 5-color photo inks which makes for better photo quality , and has a separate photo 4x6 tray which you can identify when you send to the printer , so minimizes the hassle of switching out paper -LRB- or ink cartridges , which our last printer required -RRB- . My only wish is that the paper tray also took full-sized photo paper -LRB- ideally 8.5 x11 -RRB- . Other than that , great experience so far . I should also mention that it includes a feeder tray for faxing and copying , so you do n't need to feed one sheet at a time . Overall , huge improvement over my last HP all-in-one that I purchased 18 months ago , which recently gave out on me -LRB- only time will tell if that will be an issue with this one -RRB- . 	Scanner
I listen to it almost every day and it does the job . It is very easy to use . I will enjoy it every day . I am a railfain and listen to the railroad frequences . They come in clear . Thank You 	Scanner
I completely agree with Jeff - this is a great scanner for the money & I am also going to upgrade to get ICE ... I think the other 2 reviewers are at the point I was initially - the manual offers no assistance in how to adjust this scanner to get the best performance . You need to go on the web and search out help from others who have had success with this -LRB- there are many -RRB- and other software -LRB- vuescan if you are comfortable with it -RRB- can help too . I use Photoshop CS after the scan to perfect the picture and I mostly deal with slides and very old negatives which are often dark . With the right settings it works well , it just takes time to play with it and find the right settings . I have not had the `` on - off '' problems in turning it on , but if you leave it , it will turn off , I think it does that to prevent overheating . Overall , great product , but slow & takes getting used too . 	Scanner
it works well and looks fine , however , I did n't read anywhere in the ad that said it was incompatible with a actiontec router -LRB- buyer beware -RRB- 	Scanner
After owning a scanner that required software on my computer , this is a relevation ! I can scan 10-12 slides at a time to the internal storage and then transfer them to my computer via usb . It acts like a drive . Fabulous . Crisp clear resolution . 	Scanner
"</div> <spanclass=""tiny""> Length : : 4:06 Mins </span> Although I 've had a bad experience with an EPSON printer in the past and switched to using CANON printers , this printer has regained my feelings towards EPSON again . Pros : + WiFi ! -LRB- for easy set-up to configure the printer with the network for the first time , you 'll need a USB cable temporarily -RRB- + Fast printing -LRB- for text . Printing a high quality 8x11 photo roughly took about 5 minutes -RRB- + Automatic Double-sided printing + Two trays for loading paper + LCD menu display\/card reader + Black sleek look\/All-in-One Make sure that you have the GLOSSY side\/printing side \* FACE DOWN \* when inserting in the `` Cassette 1 '' tray ; I 've wasted some photo papers not realizing it printed on the wrong side . Also , you want to be careful when you print that you have the correct `` Cassette '' \/ tray selected when printing . Even though it does print fast , it can take awhile for the first time the printer needs to `` warm-up '' before printing . "	Scanner
i need software becuase this product locks up in windows me it just does n't seem too work it worked fine in windows 98 thats all thank you donald 	Scanner
After doing three uninstalls and reinstalls my scanner is still not working . The error message is that the computer can not find the hook up . The support guy at microtek tried but could n't figure out my problem . I threw the box away so I 'm probably stuck with it . My other problem with this scanner is that the support number is not an 800 number . By the time you 're done talking to someone in support you could easily spend an hour on a long distance call . Why should I have to pay for that ? 	Scanner
This was my first time trying to buy a scanner to go with my printer and PC . I was overwhelmed with all the reviews and information on scanners . I bought the Cannon D125OU2F scanner based on price and the film negative scan feature . I was not disapointed . Easy to install , I was scanning in no time . The instructions made it simple and easy to use . Since I am a novice I do n't know what I am missing in the other equipment , and for a first time purchase , this was an excellent choice . 	Scanner
Amazing to think I bought a lesser machine for ten times the price a few years back . Here 's a good suggestion : read the amazon reviews before to find out how to save time and iron out the kinks -- you wo n't regret it . 	Scanner
This scanner was easy to set up and provides very good images . I bought it to convert some old Kodak disc negatives to prints and it did a good job . 	Scanner
I ordered this machine Feb 24th 2012 , and here it is April and it no longer works . I have sent emails with samples to the company and received nothing back . My scans are now coming out with vertical blurred lines and nothing I do is curing the problem . I 've updated the software and still nothing . I 've used their software and VueScan 's and still the problems persist . Until this happened the scans were great so I 'm very disappointed . 	Scanner
If you are using Microsoft Vista 64 , you may wish to consider another AIO , as for the time being -LRB- and for over a year to date -RRB- this will be a printer only . I receieved the following from HP customer service , `` the full printing software of HP Laser Jet printers is not available for the Windows Vista 64-bit Operating system . '' This means I ca n't copy , scan , or fax to or from my PC . Unbelievable . Since I am not changing my OS , I need to research whether HP 's competitors are compatable with Microsoft Vista 64 . As a nice looking , quiet , but rather expensive printer , it works well . 	Scanner
Not a great user interface , but it does work . Seems it could be a lot less awkward to scan an image and then download the image to a computer , but for the price , the unit is OK . 	Scanner
We are not a high volume operation , so we scan a dozen pages a day , but once a week put the scanner to its test by scanning 500 or so pages . This scanner has worked great for our needs . It takes about 20 minutes for 500 pages , in 50-page bundles . The scanner is so small that it can easily fit on a person 's desk , and folds up when not in use to be barely noticeable . The software was fine to begin with and would be even easier for those who already know the details of Adobe Acrobat -LRB- we had a learning curve on this . -RRB- We shopped around for a scanner that was n't too powerful for our needs at a larger price , but found this well-priced Documate was perfect for our volume .

Works great on windows 2000 . took me few days to actually get the driver from the epson web site . but when I installed it . i have to complains , easy to use . and fast . 	Scanner
My HP720 inkjet printer died a wicked death -LRB- the rubber\/string belt that drives the ink mechanism rotted and wound string around different internal pieces -RRB- . The printer lasted many , many years and worked perfectly until its last weeks . In looking for a replacement , I decided to add the scanner option -LRB- I did not want the fax option , so did n't look at the office all-in-ones -RRB- . I prefer to stick with HP but do n't have an issue going elsewhere as long as quality is there . This printer is everything I could have asked for . It prints photos very well with included ink -LRB- have n't tried the Vivera inks yet , but can only imagine the result will be spectacular -RRB- ; the scanner is easy to use and has scanned photos wonderfully thus far -LRB- using on-screen buttons - have n't used those buttons on the machine itself -RRB- ; the copy function works as it should -LRB- both on-screen and button on machine -RRB- . I have yet to try borderless photo printing , but that was a plus when buying this machine . I also require paper to load from horizontal position rather than the back-feed vertical position -LRB- I 've had too many problems with the latter -RRB- . The only thing I 'm not fond of thus far is that the printer wo n't automatically turn on when you send a document to print -LRB- as my HP720 did -RRB- . I turn the printer off when I 'm not using it as the lights are bright , and this printer is in my bedroom . It 's almost too minor an irritant to share . 	Scanner
Before I purchased this product , I read the Amazon reviews . There were fewer of them than now , but the opinions were just as polarized . Based on the content of the reviews , I decided that the product was probably OK and that the problems resulted from a lack of technical skill on the part of the users . Wrong . <p> All I 've been able to wring out of the IRIS pen is two lines of text printed at about one character per second followed immediately by a system crash . <p> I emailed for tech support . Silly me . <p> IRIS tech support does not exist . My first email went unanswered ; my second got a reply that said they were having trouble with their email server , so try again later . Weeks later my third try produced an error message indicating email could not be delivered to the listed address . <p> Something else they do n't tell you is the pen only works off a POWERED USB port . Plug it into your keyboard or piggyback it off a port extender and you get nothing . In my case , I had no extra ports and had to buy a $ 20 powered hub , only to produce the shoddy results reported above . <p> IRIS is quite good , however , at flooding your email with ads for more of their schlocky products . <p> The IRIS Pen may possibly work if you somehow fortuitously have the necessary configuration of hardware , memory , and operating system already in existence . If you do n't , IRIS wo n't be there to tell you what that magic combination is or to help you get the pen to function . 	Scanner
I was really impressed by this compact scanner , it offers alot of functionality for it 's size . Like the S300 , it wo n't take up any desk space and it can run on AC or via two USB cables -LRB- included -RRB- . It seems to be faster than the S300 ; a single page took only 10 seconds to scan to a PDF . You can also scan directly to an e-mail attachment and scanning directly to a printer . Also included is CardMinder , a business-card scanning program that allows you to scan business cards directly into CSV or other formats ; this makes keeping your BlackBerry address book up to date , by the way . Cards took about 10 seconds each to scan and the character recognition was excellent , even complicated cards with multiple colors and images came through -LRB- nearly -RRB- perfectly . There were a few glitches but it was still far better than most other business-card scanners I 've seen . Since the scanner is portable and runs via USB , it 's a good tool to take on the road with you . Full-size pages came through fast and clear , whether to PDF , Excel , or Word . I also appreciate some of the small conveniences . For example , there 's a one-touch button that launches the scanning program automatically . And an automatic-quality feature improves resolution on documents with fine print . The ScanSnap applications is also compatible with Windows . Its scan function is excellent and there are just so many options that you can then do afterwards . Scan to Folder , Word , Excel , E-mail and Powerpoint to name a few . This is ideal for work and I would recommend it if you are looking to purchase a scanner . In the box you receive two layers of items : - Quick start leaflet and full manuals , including a CD-ROM for Windows and Mac . - Power adapter and plug - -LRB- 2 prong -RRB- power adapter and plug - 2 x USB cables ; one for data and for one power . The power variant is of course optional . - AC adapter , which also extends the cable length of the power cord . - Last but certainly not least , the ScanSnap device itself . 	Scanner
This is a sleek scanner that performs well overall . No adapter needed for power in most computers including mine which is a Toshiba Satellite laptop . You can have it to stand on its side as well . On the other hand , it is more noisy compared to other scanners , so if you really want to get it , try to see it in action first . The noise is not that disturbing but definitely noticable . The three buttons that come on the scanner do not work at all and other users have had this complaint so there is a good chance yours wo n't be working if you purchase it ! <p> I would recommend this product esp . at the price Amazon is offering but if you do n't like noisy and screechy scanners , you would be better off with another one . 	Scanner
This is one of those computer peripherals that looks good on paper but lets you down when you get down to using it because although it is higher spec than what most people will pay for , it is still designed for people who have no idea why they want it . Amateur-enthusiast hardware and price , jo-bloggs software . <p> In my case the ScanGear CS software is a let down when it comes to scanning negatives , because it tries to do everything for you . There is no option to just see what the scanner is seeing - you are presented with a varying number of thumbnails where the software has detirmined frames are . If it does n't like a frame , it wo n't let you scan it . It will crop the image if it feels like it . Rotation and seeing two frames as one is just an annoyance that can be sorted in Photoshop , but still an annoyance . Why could n't they just have kept it simple , instead of assuming that everyone who buys this is an idiot who ca n't handle software without big soft looking buttons , and does n't really care what comes out the other end . <p> If you want to scan negatives and want any control over what is get something else . 	Scanner
There was an internal leak and ink started dripping underneath my printer and overspilled onto my floor . The color of the spilled ink was green so there was something internally faulty where yellow and blue ink are dispersed . I tried calling EPSON but after an hour with tech support I finally gave up . Horrible service for a faulty product -LRB- have had less than 1 year -RRB- . 	Scanner
I have previously owned HP and UMAX scanners in this category , and this Epson is far superior . I had it installed and scanning through Photoshop in under 10 minutes . I am amazed at how accurately it reproduces the color & contrast in my photographs . -LRB- Both my UMAX and HP always scanned very dark -RRB- . I have reduced my ` touch-up ' time in Photoshop by 50 % . <p> I was also pleasantly suprised with the quality I 'm getting from scanning black & white negatives . I 'm seeing much more detail in the scans than the photo lab was able to produce in the prints . <p> I am thrilled with this scanner ! 	Scanner
This item did not work so I sent it back and the second one worked for about 15 pages then quit . Do not buy this item . 	Scanner
Warning ! This comes with virtually no documentation . There is a thick booklet , but it 's in about twenty languages with only about 5 pages devoted to any one and most of that information is useless . You are left pretty much to your own devices . There is on-screen help of a sort , but it 's so chopped and diced that it 's hard to get an overview of just how to start anything . The OCR and pdf functions DO NOT WORK with Mac OS 5 . X and I got NO response from HP when I reported this problem . I never was able to get a satisfactory slide scan . The seller DID accept a return -- less a 15 % restocking fee . The Canon CanoScan 8600F is a little more expensive , but all its functions work flawlessly , it comes with at least a hard copy getting started guide , and a single , reasonably user-friendly on-screen guide . It also has steel lid hinges instead of the plastic ones on the HP and a glance inside the workings show solid , clearly superior construction . 	Scanner
open the box , install software , plug it in and scan . works perfectly for me for scanning in all of my old photos -LRB- I 'm going all digital -RRB- . the auto scan and save mode works well , and made it almost effortless to archive years worth of photos . I also like the high spedd USB 2.0 interface to speed transfers to my laptop . I did not try the film scanner attachment , but it works great on normal photos . highly recommend ! 	Scanner
Oh my god , I should stop reading the amazon or magazine reviews or should not buy products with 5 \*\*\*\*\* reviews !! . . When I installed the Software this scanner came with , I spent whole night recovering the my PC as it crashed my outlook and I ended up with lot , lot of lost emails and headache . It did NOT scan the Business cards 100 % . I would say , it can scan only 75 % of card info . most of the time and one big disappointment , that It does not scan lender bills or any bills , so it 's use is limited . For the price of $ 175 , I was expecting more mature product but ... I think this product needs more quality control testing and more wider approach in their business area . I strongly think this tiny scanner at $ 175 is too expensive and a waste of money and if you do n't like it on day one , you will never use it . I am Returning it as I wo n't use it anymore for sure . 	Scanner
My former All-in-One Printer was the Epson Artisan 700 , however it was getting old from heavy usage after a few years , and I replaced it with this Epson Artisan 837 . It was purchased locally and not from Amazon . Loved the Artisan 700 -LRB- see my review of it -RRB- and love this new Artisan 837 for the same reasons . Photos done by the Artisan 837 are flawless , and I actually prefer it 's ICM color settings -LRB- In Advanced settings on your settings page . -RRB- to the settings in Adobe Photoshop for color rendition in Printed pictures . Made two copies of a complex color print , and compared them side by side for that test . Standard printing is also flawless . The WiFi is built into this printer , so you do not have to buy any additional parts for WiFi connection to your network ; and it connected correctly the first time to my home network . You do have the option to set it up to operate over your network , or by USB cable ; however you have to choose on setup . If you decide to change , it is simple to reload the software and set it up again for either USB or WiFi by network . This is my first All-in one printer with built in Fax , and when I needed it the Fax function worked perfectly . There is a learning curve to using this printer , but the printer will walk you through the steps to do each thing in `` Setup '' . There is also an actual instruction manual included with the printer to help ; which is much better than having to go to the web for your instructions , or trying to find items in an onscreen display from an `` Included PDF file '' while making changes to the printer at the same time . I have always loved Epson printers for their print quality , and this one did not disappoint me . Additional Bonus : 1 January 2012 . My new Smart Phone allows me to send photos taken with the phone , directly from the phone to the Epson 837 , through it 's WiFi . Not having to go through the computer , or otherwise `` Wire-up '' , to handle Cell Phone Photos is a nice bonus to using the WiFi in this printer . 	Scanner
This is my first scanner and it was recommended to me by someone who has been using HP scanners for years . It was easy to install and get started . And the scanned pictures look fantastic !!! Also , in resonse to the reviewer from Palmyra , PA : Yes , you can crop with this scanner . After the initial preview scan , use your mouse to box-off the portion of the image you want to save . Then proceed to complete the scan . The saved image will only be the portion you boxed-off . 	Scanner
After 2 + hours with a technician on the phone , we have concluded that it will not work on my PC for an unknown reason . Probably an incompatibility issue . My Pc is a Dell and operating system is Windows ME . The scanner hardware seems to work fine and the software seems to be working , but together they are not working . It is being returned ASAP . I like HP products , but this one is not working . Beware . 	Scanner
The industry has come a long way from the days when I first used a scanner . Thie HP Scanjet 4370 continually amazes me with its capacity to do everything from 2x2 slides to isolate a section of a document , scanning it , and then e-mailing it to a 3rd party . I have not attempted to use all of its features yet but I am terribly impressed so far with what I have seen . Kudos to Hewlett Packard . 	Scanner
First let me state one negative comment : Although the set-up instructions call for a USB cable , none is supplied . Fortunately I save everything and had one in my cornucopia of computer supplies . Now for the positives : I was able to set up my Lenovo Laptop wirelessly without a hitch and printed a perfect test page . The copy function works perfectly too . Then I went to set up my Acer netbook and after several attempts called Epson 's support line which was answered immediately by a technician who talked me through a number of solutions and bingo , I was my Acer now can print wirelessly . The Epson NX625 has a generous paper tray and is a solidly built unit . The ink cartridges are mini-sized . I am very impressed with this 3 in 1 and would highly recommend it to anyone wishing to print from one of their wireless units . I am very impressed with Epson 's tech support and how quickly they were able to resolve my issues . The set up instructions are written very clearly in steps to be followed . The drivers may also be downloaded from -LRB- ... -RRB- . An installation disk is supplied . 	Scanner
I bought this scanner to use while working on my ancestry . I had it just over 1 month and took it out to scan some information and where the batteries go , it was extremely hot , and smelt of burning metal . Thus it did not work any more ! I emailed the vendor and got a number for technical support , who told me that they only thing that I could do was to box it up and send it back to them at my expense and they would check it out for me , or I could reoder a new one . Well I did reorder a new one , but not from them . I went with another vendor ! I will say that while it worked it was great ! I just wished I would have gotten my money worth ! 	Scanner
I 've been waiting for this scanner for months and months but it has been worth the wait . I had it on pre-order and have finally got the opportunity to get it . I was eyeing the Microtek 6800 for quite some time but decided to hold out for a legal sized scanner that also had positive and negative capabilities . I was also impressed with the price point of $ 599 MSRP . I was expecting it to push $ 799 or more based on the speculated features but was pleasantly surprised when the vendor told me . <p> With that being said I received the scanner yesterday and immediately torn into it . I am impressed with the physical construction of the unit . The scanner has metal railings inside and is quite solid . Nothing appears cheap or thrown together and I appreciate knowing that its not just plastic that was formed together last week . The scanner is both firewire and USB 2.0 so I chose to hook it up via firewire as most of my USB ports were tied up with PDA , Printer , Mouse\/Keyboard , Smart Card Reader , etc. . Installed the ScanWizard Pro software , restarted the computer and turned on the scanner . Windows XP picked it up and I was able to do a Scanner Test to verify it was working within a few seconds . <p> Once the scanner was up and running I launched Photoshop CS and then ScanWizard Pro through the File menu . Once it was up I imported my ICM profiles for my monitor and printer . This allows for accurate color reproduction but is not necessary depending on what you are doing with the output . I was very impressed with the time it takes to actually scan . About 10 seconds or less for a preview . <p> As for the actual scans I was pleasantly surprised . I have a dedicated slide scanner but it does n't do large format items . I bought a piece of anti-newton ring glass and used it to flatten my items between the 8x10 glass plate that is included . This insures that the image is completely flat while maintaining the benefits of the i900 's glassless positive and negative scanning . Scanning at a modest 1200 PPI I was surprised at the quality that I got . Reflective scans of course came out even better . I for one am very impressed with the optics of this unit . <p> As for the main feature , Digital ICE I can honestly say that this too is superb . I 've read online how Digital ICE used to take almost half an hour to accomplish , this scanner does it in roughly a fourth of that time . The images that Microtek has online appear close to what I am getting with the i900 . It saves me a considerable amount of time inside Photoshop and on the three photos I 've tried they required little to no cleanup work beyond Digital ICE . <p> All in all I 'm very pleased with my purchase . This will compliment my Artixscan 4000 quite nicely . I could n't have asked for more and it delivers on everything it promises ! 	Scanner
This unit did n't work for 5 different make\/model cars and trucks . I contacted the seller who told me it was n't compatible with an iphone or my laptops bluetooth . I was informed it only works with android . Tried on a nexus 1 and nexus s , neither worked . Unit never powered up so I was never able to see if it was useful . I returned the product for a refund and was unable to get a replacement from the seller . 	Scanner
I have been using this printer for about a month now and I am really happy with it . I have been through quite a few all-in-one\/multifunction printers in my life and I can say this is probably the best inkjet version I have ever used , also probably the heaviest , which makes me think it is going to be with me for a long time . I know it is silly to equate weight with longevity , but the machine just feels sturdy and I am not always worried about breaking it . I tried out the scanner and fax functions and found them to work as designed . I am not a huge fan of the Epson software that comes with the scanning function , but most programs due that stuff automatically , so no worries there . All images were good scanned into the computer ; fax looked like any other fax I had sent or received . The big thing you get with this puppy , is print speed and automatic two sided printing . This is probably the fast inkjet I have ever used which is nice , if you are making copies . The two sided printing is really nice . The first printer I have ever had that came with that function . Not that it was hard to do before but it saves time of me having to reinsert the paper all the time . My big drawback is that the Epson ink is expensive , you can check the prices on Amazon , but I find genuine regular Epson ink is the most expensive of the big brands -LRB- Epson , HP , and Cannon -RRB- . And if you are using this in an office you can expect to go through a lot of ink . I do n't think it goes though any more ink than any other standard inkjet but , lots of printing means buying lots of expensive ink . I suppose you could use aftermarket brand inks , or get refills , but I have never been one to do that and I ca n't speak to how it would work . I did setup the printer to work via WiFi via a router to the computers in my office , took a little bit of time but it worked fine on all my computers . And I connected one computer via usb and it was pretty much plug and play with no problems . They were PCs running Windows 7 so I ca n't speak to Mac . Overall other then ink cost I am very happy with this machine . If you have any questions feel free to leave a comment and I would be happy to answer your questions . 	Scanner
I had a problem with these speakers in that they picked up a radio broadcast that was clearly audible when there was no sound from the source and discernible when there was sound from the source . I spoke to customer service and they said they were aware of the problem in areas with significant radio presence , i.e. large markets . I was told to wrap aluminum foil or ferrite rings around the wires . I used the aluminum foil -- the interference was diminished but still present . Also , I did n't like the design of the volume and power controls . The power switch is on the bass unit , which if put under the desk is hard to get to . Also , adjusting the volume caused static in the speakers . However , when the source overpowered the interference , the speakers do sound really good . I traded the speakers in for a Phillips pair that sound much better , are better designed , do not pick up any interference and only cost $ 10 more . If you live in a large market , definitely pay the money to upgrade to a better set . 	Speaker
This three-footed friction mount is FAR superior to the horrid suction cup mount which Garmin forces you to buy -LRB- part of the bundle -RRB- with the Quest . Now I can actually read the display while I am driving , or turn the GPS so that my front seat passenger can read it . 	Speaker
Bose is known for its quality , but usually at a formidable price , it tends to be on the more expensive side of sound products . This portable system sounds good but , at such a small size and large price , there are better options . 	Speaker
I have been looking for iPod speakers for the past month . These , by far , have been the best I have seen for the money . I like the size , the weight and the fact that I 'm not restricted to a wall plug . I feel I have spent my money well . However , do n't ever opt for the gift wrapping . All you get is a cheap cloth bag with you product thrown in there and poorly tied with a ribbon . That has been the worst wrapping I have ever seen . 	Speaker
Good speakers for the price . I highly recommend them . 	Speaker
Nice full sound , very cool appearance , reasonable cost . Would recommend to anyone looking for well priced , good sounding computer speakers . 	Speaker
I travel alot and this really suits my needs . Its compact and nice looking . It 's not studio quality sound , but I am quite satisfied , Sitting in a hotel room , by the pool the sound actally is quite amazing for its size . Easy setup , plug in the USB and in 30 seconds you are ready , Wife already wants one for her suitcase . 	Speaker
I have purchased already three of the Altec Lansing iM-237 speakers . After my first purchase and realizing how amazing this little speaker was I got two more as gifts for my family and friends . For such a small thing , this speaker has a very nice bass and clear sound . I love taking it with me when I travel . I even started using it outside when I sit in a yard . The speaker comes in a nice zip-cover so it is easy to store it . 	Speaker
When I first received these speakers , I was really excited by the chic look to them . It 's easy enough to get them hooked up , and it even came with an aux . cord and little stand for my Ipod . Great ! The music quality is a decent , balanced sound -LRB- which was exactly what I was looking for -RRB- , but falters when you try to hold conversations -LRB- via Skype etc -RRB- . Occasionally the sound becomes warbled or ... muffled , I suppose . I 've only had the product for a day , so it 's not from wear and tear . This may be simply because it 's a cheap set of speakers . Not sure . At any rate , do n't expect miracles from this , but they seem to be pretty decent . I 'm not sure if the set is worth the price , but I 'm also not sure about the average cost of speakers . So , if you 're not looking for lots of bass , it 's an alright product . 	Speaker
I have a hard case with belt clip on my I-Pod Touch which prevents it from connecting to a docking station . This cable enables it to connect up with no problems . Also I no longer have to sit on the living room floor to change songs , etc. . All the functions are the same . There is no difference in using it . It is simply a 30 pin in , 30 pin out . Just like an extension cord for an electrical device , it does n't effect the operation of the device . 	Speaker
At the price , you ca n't expect a TON , but I was still pretty disappointed in this system , compared to its competitors . As far as music went , the sound came across as very flat and 'em pty ' . Its very reliant on the subwoofer to make alot of noise , but its not good noise . No rich , vibrant tones could be had , even after playing around with EQ settings . It definitely makes noise though - this would be best applied for the budget gamer or regular user . . not particularly adapted for someone who uses their PC as a jukebox , however . The subwoofer is very strong for its size . 	Speaker
THE REVIEWER : I am a composer , live sound reinforcement engineer and own my own recording studio in the Dallas area . I am a huge fan of high-end audio , and in particular , surround sound ! When it came time to build my new PC , I opted for the newest Creative Audigy 2ZS sound card ... which more than met all of my needs for gaming and \* most \* of my MIDI and less demanding digital audio work . Now , first , I must say that the Gigaworks line-up is astounding on its own ; however , add to any Gigaworks arrangement the Audigy2 line of audio cards , and there can be no other combination for your PC ! I admit to being a long-time user and fan of Creative products , and I make no apologies for that . From my very first SB16 , through the very impressive Platinum version of SB Live ! card , each product has lived up to -- and even exceeded -- my expectations . My original purchase was the 7.1 Megaworks setup by Creative . I can honestly say , it was a good sound , but not good enough for MY ears . The midrange was weak and definitely lacking . The distortion in the low-end was evident on truly powerful 7.1 selections , and the system had numerous resonant frequency issues , which resulted in buzzes and rattles that unnerved me ! Needless to say , it WENT BACK ! FAST ! I audtitioned several systems this time , rather than just going by brand name and features . As with most , the Logitechs were appealing , but simply did NOT have what it took in the end . Additionaly , I configured my best friends ' 5.1 Logitech setup , and I HATED it from the start . Balancing the satellites and sub with the center channel was virtually impossible . Every signal fed to it reguired tweaking of some kind . Thus , I knew the Logitech offerings were OUT ! Back to Creative . -LRB- And yes , I looked at everything else from BA 's on , and nothing else had the feature-set or raw power handling capacity of the Gigaworks setup ! -RRB- Okay , the Megaworks was less than mind-blowing ... even to the point of being disappointing ... but NOT Gigaworks !!! WoW . That is it in a nutshell . I can not seem to shake this system loose . No matter how hard I press it , this system hangs with my Polks , Klipsch and even Infinity Kappa speakers . I have a set of studio reference Tannoy NFMs -LRB- bi-amplified by Carver -RRB- that I use in my studio for mix-down , and I admit , the Creative Gigaworks are more natural and comfortable to listen to for long periods . Would I mix-down my beloved work on them ... NO. . . but then , what professional would ? That is not what Creative intended them to be used for -- although some might argue they could be . BOTTOM LINE : The looks are n't as impressive as some of the Logitech offerings , but if this is what you are after , then you are n't likely to care about any of these reviews anyway ! The sound is fantastic , so they can look plain for all I care . NOTES : Bass response is very impressive -- although place the sub away from a corner and face the port at an angle away from any parallel walls to avoid TREMENDOUS standing waves and unnecessary -LRB- and unnatural -RRB- peaks -LRB- boominess -RRB- . Most audiophiles will find it necessary to attenuate the sub output -LRB- very easily done even by remote -RRB- , and most club-kids will find the bass response PERFECT no doubt ! The high-end is magical for a component system in this price-range . Frequency roll-off is natural , and though the satellites all have the exact same driver configuration , the high-end is not overly bright or tinny . The system is not all frequency-match and perfectly paired like many high-end system , though this is not necessary . Each satellite diligently and faithfully recreates whatever signal is fed to it . The system sits idly with NO audible hiss . In standby , the the system emits no heat , but at full-tilt , the amplifier -LRB- housed within the sub -RRB- can put off quite a bit of heat ! The system does not degrade noticebly even after hours of hard use . Color-coded wiring make installation a breeze for novices , but I really wish this system was wireless -LRB- at least between the sub and satellites -RRB- but we can all have a wish-list , right ?! Anyway , the wiring is probably the messiest and ugliest part of the entire setup -- though not as bad as some I have seen , including my buddy 's Logitechs . If you want to wall-mount the satellites , the wires are n't likely to be long enough . The center channel can easily go above or below your picture ... as the software provides perfect THX phase alignment and timing adjustments . The system SHOULD come with stands for sides and rears ... but again ... we can WISH ! -LRB- They are available from Creative 's website , though not exactly cheap ! -RRB- All-in-all , if you need 5.1 or 7.1 surround , and you have a VERY high-end audio card ... the Gigaworks system is the only REAL solution for you . Check one out at your local retailer ... or listen to your friend 's , but either way , listen soon ... you 'll be glad you did . The money was well spent . Would do it again ... and most of us have at least one major purchase we regret ... so enough said . Hope you find this helpful . Happy Listening ! 	Speaker
Terrific example of style over substance . Waited for weeks for a version to match the rest of the system 's color & got a pair when they were issued . Read reviews about `` technology overcoming small size '' -- baloney . No bass response to speak of ; Duets perform far less well than my 5-year-old beige -LRB- SO 20th-Century ! -RRB- Altec-Lansings for the same purchase price . Bottom line : Speakers look great , sound cheesy . 	Speaker
I received and assembled these yesterday . To my surprise , the package contained 2 stands even though the technical details on the Amazon site states ` Item Quantity 1 ' . There should be proper information to let you know there are 2 sent for each order ! Nevertheless , after the easy assembly I can say this is truly a quality product and I would highly recommend them . They are holding my monster Klipsch RS-3 surround speakers and they are more than adequate for this purpose , and look great ! 	Speaker
We purchased this phone mainly for the 5.8 GHz technology to reduce interference with our wireless internet connection . We are using this phone with Packet8 's VoIP phone service , and have seen lots of improvement in voice quality . I would recommend this phone for any person using a VoIP service or needing multiple cordless handsets . 	Speaker
I purchased 4 pairs of theese speakers and installed them in my family room -LRB- I only used 7 -RRB- for a surround sound system . they were easy to install and ended up using 300 feet of cable . For the price of theese speakers the sound that comes out is unbelievable . Billy Joel was n't kidding when he said you get more mileage from a cheep pair of speakers . The frist thing I did was put Ice Age in the Blueray Player and the THX sound check was AWESOM . My wife who really could care less about thees things was impressed I do n't think I will ever go to the movie theater again . I highly recomend theese speakers . 	Speaker
"I have these speakers connected to a DAYTON AUDIO DTA-100A amp , and i am us <ahref=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004JK8BDK/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/186-9199430-2652938""> Dayton Audio DTA-100a Class-T Digital Amplifier 50 WPC </a> ing them as computer speakers and for the price and the sound quality i could not ask for more . Excellent speakers ! I am very satisified with PARTS EXPRESS shipping too "	Speaker
I purchased this phone set for work , thinking that inexpensive replacement phones would ease the pain of things being spilled on them or dropped . The sound quality has been poor since day one , the base constantly drops calls , and now there seems to be some sort of short circuit in the base -- we can no longer use the AC adapter with the base or it turns off completely . When I purchased this set , I never imagined I would be running my business telephones off of 4 AA batteries . Other complaints : you ca n't put line 1 on hold and answer line 2 with the same handset without a `` conference call '' beginning . The incoming call volume is incredibly low and it is often difficult to hear my customers -LRB- it was so bad I had my hearing tested because I thought something was wrong with me . Yes , I 'm blonde , but this proves to me it 's the phones ! -RRB- . I will never buy another GE phone again . Period . 	Speaker
Quality sound at a great price ... This system turned my mac mini into an audio powerhouse ! Love it ; easy to use , extremely powerful sound , and it 's crystal clear . Looks sharp too ; it 's a little bulky , but for the features and quality it 's totally excusable . One of the best affordable audio systems out there for your mac . Ps . The subwoofer slams ... nasty ... I love it . 	Speaker
These speakers exceeded my expectations . I was not really keen on making the compromise of in-ceiling speakers for my rear surrounds , but was forced to due to space considerations . They sound great , and I 'm happy that I went this route . I think Yamaha are vastly underrated in the speaker category . 	Speaker
I have been using these speakers for almost a year and am still as impressed as I was the forst day that I hooked them up . These are great speakers , well worth the price . I have hear no other computer speaker that could produce such as sound stage . Superb . 	Speaker
not a very good speaker but for the price what do you expect i think the blowed speaker i replaced could keep up with these they dont sound bad until you turn the radio up to higher sound levels then you know you got what you paid for 	Speaker
These speakers work great , are affordable , and are n't they just the cutest little speakers you ever saw ? 	Speaker
after reading a lot of reviews on this , OSD and Phoenix Gold 8 `` ers -LRB- all the same OEM -RRB- I decided to get a pair of the better looking Micca M-8S speakers . I plugged em ' in to a 100w RMS amplifier and started them off slowly with some lower frequency break-in , they have very good frequency response and responded all the way down to 5Hz actually . that being said , audibly , these have a very modest low range . the mids are great and the soft dome tweeter has presence without being shrill . really , what they sound like are expensive 6.5 '' speakers . very good , but not what I expected . I added a Definitive Sub 10\/10 to my setup and it sounds magnificent . they handle power very well without distortion and I would absolutely pick up another set if the need arose . the build quality is pretty good , above that of lower-end stuff like Pyle and Acoustic Audio , but below things like Polk and well below that of Definitive tech . for their price range , they 're killer speakers and they are well made . snap them up while they 're cheap . this brand is relatively new and I see it picking up speed with this speaker line . I 'll be recommending them to clients in the ` want nice , mid range sound without the price of a very comparable Polk 8 '' . to sum up , they 're terrific , but light on the low range . EDIT : I backed the speakers with some insulation and reduced the wall cavity to about 2 ft ^ 3 and the low range came alive on these speakers . the sound stage is truly excellent . 	Speaker
this product works great for me I got my speakers and was off to the beach . The product got here very fast and in perect shape . thanks Price depot Co. . Ximena 	Speaker
Bought this pair to replace the broken OEM front door speakers in my 2005 Ford Taurus . The sound is GREAT ! Far better sound than I expected from such a low priced speaker pair . They sound great even when the volume is cranked up to the max . 	Speaker
I bought these speakers to replace my decades-old bookshelf speakers with something much , much smaller and easier to hide in a small family room . Then , I plugged in my new Samsung LCD TV into my old audio receiver so I could output the TV 's sound through my stereo system . Call it my cheap `` home theater '' setup . The Samsung TV looks fantastic , but the sound played through the TV 's built-in speakers is abysmal -- but I do n't care ! I just power-on two devices -- my TV and my stereo receiver -- to get both great sound AND great audio using my home stereo receiver and these Bose speakers . The two , small , Bose Accoustimass speakers sit atop my entertainment armoire that houses my stereo and TV . In order to improve the sound , I cut and painted two small , wooden wedges so the speakers atop my armoire are pointed slightly downward , towards the leather couch where we sit to watch TV . The woofer sits beside the armoire . The sound is good , not amazing , but okay for my set-up . I liked that the audio cables were very long and easy to install into these speakers . Just press a button at the back of the speaker to insert the bare wires of the audio cable into the speaker . Also , the audio cables are very clearly labeled red and black , so it 's foolproof to ensure you 've got the right polarity . Conclusion : These are n't a 5-star product because they deliever the best sound possible from home speakers . No , they are a 5-star product because they deliver very good sound in a very small form factor , and at a very affordable price . 	Speaker
After trying various Logitech and Cyber Acoustic 2.1 systems that sounded more or less `` okay '' , I finally decided to give the Klipsch ProMedia 2.1 's a try . In a word ... there 's NO COMPARISON . -LRB- Okay ... that 's two words . -RRB- The Klipsch 2.1 's blew away all the other 2.1 systems . Granted , the ProMedia 's cost about 3 times as much , but still ... You FEEL the music with these speakers , even at low volumes -LRB- which , in its own way , is even a better test of a speaker system than blasting them til your ears bleed . -RRB- No other system I tried resulted in the ability to feel the music like the ProMedia 2.1 's . A while back I made a USB flash drive with all of my favorite songs to play in my car -- over 1,200 songs , covering all different genres . So to give these new speakers a real world workout I plugged that USB drive into my laptop , loaded everything into WMP , hooked up the ProMedia 2.1 's , and after the first few tunes I was in heaven . I had n't heard so much out of these tunes since my old Atlantic Technology 3 piece system died . The bass took on a life of its own , as did the highs , mids , and sound stage . I ca n't speak to the durability problems since I just got the speakers at Best Buy yesterday . But judging only by the sound , they are amazing , especially for the price . Would I prefer an on\/off switch ? Yes . Am I a bit concerned about the problems cited with the DIN plug ? Yes . Do those issues offset the sound coming out of this system ? Not at the present time . But I 'll certainly update this review if\/when the DIN problem arises . For now , I 'm just enjoying music in a way that I can only describe as thrilling . And I have n't had that experience in quite some time . Listening to the ProMedia 2.1 's showed me , almost instantly , just how much I 'd been missing . 	Speaker
Here 's a case that allows music lovers to take music with them - ANYWHERE ! I 'm talking about the Eco-EXTREME , Rugged All Terrain Speaker Case . Take it hiking , fishing , or rock climbing ! The waterproof case connects to your mp3 player with a universal 1\/8 '' headset jack and works with most mp3 players . -LRB- See website for a list . -RRB- The high impact , shock resistant case is made of durable rubber , and includes a built-in 3 '' full range forward firing speaker . The sound quality is awesome - whether you 're listening to rock or classical or country western . For the technical purchaser , the speaker output is 3W RMS ; frequency response is 200Hz - 10 KHz . I even like the volume control on the front - it feels rugged and is very responsive . It requires 3 AA batteries that will provide about 30 hrs of play . It 's very easy to set up - just plug , snap shut , and play . The internal compartment can hold your mp3 player , keys , credit cards , driver 's license and cash . How handy is that on a hike ! A very sturdy , detachable carabineer is included , which allows you to clip the case on a bike or backpack . The manufacturer offers the case in jet black , cobalt blue and orange peel . Retails for $ 49.99 . I guess I 'd have to say , I like everything about this case . In other words , it 's EXTREMELY COOL ! 	Speaker
First of all , I disagree with any suggestions that the bass on this system is boomy in a bad way . I also disagree that this system sounds like a boombox . It sounds great ! I chose this system in particular because it 's THX Certified , so I knew it was unlikely that they 'd sound disappointingly bad . They sound wonderful , in my opinion , and I have n't even touched any equalizers . I got them for my girlfriend so she would n't be stuck with 2W laptop speakers anymore . I 'm breaking them in with some trance at a moderate volume right now . Mid-range is n't the best , but it 's certainly there and enough to satisfy anyone not looking to spend $ 300 + on computer speakers . The highs and lows sound great and personally I think the bass is at a perfect level -LRB- at 50 % -RRB- , definitely not boomy . In fact , it beats my -LRB- albeit 11 year old -RRB- Altec Lansing ADA885 system 's subwoofer -LRB- system originally $ 300 -RRB- . Bottom line is for the price , these things sound GREAT and have tons of good bass . Highly recommend . Definitely worth spending the extra money over a cheaper $ 60 system ... grab these instead , you 'll be glad you did . 	Speaker
Good sound but no remote makes this device a good buy at the price , but a few simple 21st century touches would be 5 star . 	Speaker
It mostly worked well for a couple of months - the only problem was that it was annoying to have to go back and forth between the speaker and the docking station to adjust the volume before getting in the shower - you pretty much have to turn the volume all the way up on the ipod for this speaker , and then turn it back down for use with your headphones . But otherwise , it was great . But then , while adjusting the volume on the speaker while in the shower , I pushed up on the speaker a bit -LRB- the buttons are near the bottom of the speaker -RRB- , and the hook that goes over the shower head went up just enough so that it was no longer hooked over the shower head , and the speaker fell to the bottom of the tub , which obviously damaged the speaker because after that the sound was full of static . I do n't know why the hook is so short ; it did n't take much at all to knock off . In the future , I would buy a speaker with a better hooking mechanism , or if I bought the same one , I would probably just put it on the floor beside the shower so that it could n't fall and break again . 	Speaker
PROS Surprisingly good sound stage . Independent adjustment for bass and treble Input for for headphones and universal mini jack for mp3 players and such . Excellent range - Highs are crisp and sharp -LRB- but not overly sharp -RRB- the lows ore deep and accurate , and it still has a solid mid-range . Cons -LRB- all minor things -RRB- bass adjustment is on the back of the sub-woofer . wire connecting the left and right speaker could be a bit longer -LRB- prevents more elaborate speaker placement -RRB- The left and right speakers are very light at the base and thus easily knocked over . 	Speaker
After reading reviews , I bought this product . I liked the design but the product arrived defective . The 3.5 mm jack is defect , which makes this product unusable . If the 3.5 mm jack was fine then this could be we a good product for its price . I requested for a refund . 	Speaker
These stands were bought after much research on satellite speaker stands for our PSB surround sound setup . I have two alpha book case speakers and the two smaller satellite L\/R speakers -LRB- do n't remember the name of the series -RRB- . Assembly was not quite as elegant as I had hoped , but the stands are sturdy and I ca n't complain too much for the price . They fit in nicely with the decor too . The first problem was the speaker mounts were too small . The small loops that go over the back fell short of the mounting holes . I remedied this by flipping the speakers over . Not exactly what most would suggest , but I do n't worry about it too much -LRB- the upside down psb label is barely noticed -RRB- . The sound is n't effected by this noticibly as the room is relatively small . The next problem : The stands are rusting . I should have expected it to as it 's an iron construction , but it happened within a week . I have to scrap it down and retouch . I 'm still holding onto them , but I hope it was just a bad seal\/paint job and maybe a stray chunk of snow or drop of water got snugged up under there . They are stable , but hard to rid of cat hair due to the texture . In a highly modern design they are fairly plain compared to some of the more sinuous and flowing stainless steel stands . However , our room is fairly simple as we live in a cape cod so they blend well . Bottom line : I 'm satisfied , but I wish they were n't rusting so quickly . 	Speaker
Bought as a b-day gift for the wife . She loves it . Uses it all the time , to the point where I have to ask her to turn it down some . IMO it puts out great sound and charges the iPhone at the same time . It 's small enough to take on trips . 	Speaker
I read about these beauties in boing-boing and the was interested . For the money these speakers are absolutely amazing . Huge sound , with amazing clarity and excellent base response . I Actually had to dial back these tiny terrors because they were too loud . At full throttle the base was muddy and tubby and really , really loud . The amount of punch delivered by the unit is astounding . In more normal operating conditions the speakers are near flawless . The base is full and punchy , the midrange is clean , and the highs are super-crisp and not a bit tinny . As my FOXL spends almost all of its time tethered to a MacBook , battery life is not a concern . The FOXL happily sucks down USB power from the Mac . I have noted that there is a buzz from the unit when operated in this manner . How the DC voltage from the USB is causing a hum is bit of a mystery that is solved by just unplugging the unit from the USB hub . It may not be the fault of the unit but of the macally 7 port hub I use . Bottom line I can not praise the FOXL enough . If music matters to you and you need a high quality portable rig to play your tunes , go no father , this is your unit . 	Speaker
Better than I thought after reading the reviews . Sounds great and easily portable . Have n't used the battery yet , only plugged in . We use it mainly for the patio and outside deck . I was looking for something that was small and puts off good sound and this does . Only reason I did n't give it 5 starts is because of price . Seems a little steep for something of this sort . 	Speaker
The Cta Digital Portable Dual Speaker is perfect as a personal listening device . They say it is for an ipod but works on must devices with an audio out jack for headphones . Yes , it is not loud , but those devices that amplify sound need batteries and this does not . Also , I purchased this to play on the beach when I come out and I am wet and do n't want to plug in ear phones . It is not too loud to disturb anyone and it is loud enough for me to hear while it is next to me . Perfect tool for the job . 	Speaker
Works great ; took me 10 to 15 minutes to hook up to my Sony STR-DH510 . Spent another 10 minutes to focus the speakers and I was done . Sound quality , not the best but , will not complain . 	Speaker
When I bought this surround sound systemn for my computer it was my first . I spent a long time searching and these speakers read better than any other in this price range . I went for it , and I made the right choice . All the cables are extremly long so you do n't have to worry about the speakers reaching . I have trouble with my center and rear speakers at first , but I quickly worked out these minor flaws . Now i love these speaker . The subwoofer will rock your world . It shakes , it rubles , and boy can you make it LOUD !!!!!!!!!!!! 	Speaker
I purchased these speaker stands about a week ago . Before ordering I read the reviews and was a little unsure of what to expect as the views were varied . Box arrived just fine , not crushed or anything . Husband put them together -LRB- but took his time -RRB- . Take a break in between if you can and have patience . Your end result will be perfect . It did take us more than a half hour , becuase of the break . Had no problem at all with wood splitting . He used only a screw driver . No problem with the size and quality . They were better then expected for the price . The plastic that covers the wires needs to be re-designed a bit . We bent them slightly and they were installed with no problem . Do n't go `` Rambo '' with the bending , or you will crack the plastic . It would be nice however to have a cover that matched the front , a one piece that just snaps in . If your looking for a low priced stand , go for it . We liked them so much , that I just ordered the 31 inch . 	Speaker
These speakers are stylish and sound great -- until you use them in the same room as a GSM phone -LRB- i.e. AT&T or T-Mobile -RRB- . The amplifier and cables are completely unshielded , and they make the loudest , most obnoxious buzzing around a cell phone that I have ever heard out of a pair of speakers . My phone makes most speakers chirp a little , but these things belch out the interference at heretofore unheard volumes . Completely unusable if you plan to charge your iPhone next to your iMac . 	Speaker
Loved this phone when I first got it -- a big , bright backlit LCD screen , satisfactory sound , solid features -LRB- flash , redial , mute , etc. ; speakerphone was n't that great , but really never used it anyway -RRB- . After a few months , though , things started to get funny . First , the screen insisted on telling me I had `` 3 NEW CALLS '' permanently -LRB- even though I did n't -RRB- . Then , inexplicably , the Caller ID information would suddenly appear as gibberish , or as weird variations on phone numbers and\/or words -LRB- for example , `` 202020202 '' or `` KALIFORNIA NJLL '' -RRB- . Finally , last week , the dial tone disappeared , replaced forever , alas , by static . Goodbye , dear phone , it was a fun year-and-a-half . 	Speaker
Sending back . Worked one day only . Possibly defective AC cord ... but unlikely to reorder . Nice size , good sound the one day it worked . 	Speaker
I recommend these speakers for outside use . We use them in our back yard patio area . They were very easy to set up . My only problem is when I move them outside the recommended range from the transmitter , which is 21 feet , there is static interference . After some movement of the speakers to eliminate static , they work perfectly . I would say that one of my speakers is roughly 40 feet from the transmitter . 	Speaker
Its got amazing sound , it 's loud and just a great product . . I own a lot of logitech products and this is my favorite one . . the only issue i have is when i use this with my macbook pro , i only get sound out of the rear speakers or the front 's depending which chord i have plugged in to my headphone jack . . I tried matrix mode and it no sound comes out , so i need to investigate my setup a bit more to see if i can at least get sound out of all my speakers rather then just the two and the sub . . Regardless , this sounds incredible ... Buy this if you want good , no i meant GREAT sounding speakers hooked up to your computer or other system u may use . . 	Speaker
I am really \* very \* pleased with these speakers ; they sound great and -- well , OK -- they look pretty cool , too . I 'm using them with my G4 powerbook and the sound is awesome . -LRB- It got a lot better , by the way , once I turned off the `` preamp '' feature of iTunes -LRB- under Equalizer -RRB- , which seemed to be introducing some static . -RRB- I purchased them thinking surely they can be used with my powerbook -- but , no , they ca n't . You have to purchase the iFire adapter -LRB- another $ 40 or so -RRB- . The speakers require BOTH the headphone outlet and the firewire outlet on my powerbook , so I can not use my firewire external hard drive and the speakers simultaneously until I get a firewire splitter or hub -LRB- which is a nuisance , but not that big a problem -RRB- . My only complaint is that Apple really ought to have included an adapter with the speakers in the first place . I imagine a lot of people have purchased these speakers without realizing that they are only `` plug-and-play ready '' if you have an iMac -- or else they have thought , once they received their speakers , that they ca n't be used . With the iFire adapter , all you need is a standard headphone jack and a firewire plug and you 're good to go . And that 's why I 'm giving this product four stars instead of five . Even with the extra cost of the adapter , however , I think these speakers are still a terrific value . 	Speaker
No dead pix . Speaker works but do n't count on good quality from 1-watt speaker . Slow shipping . 	Speaker
Great buy . Couldent be happier . Great for the money . Sound quality was great . Wasnt expecting much and was so surprised 	Speaker
Positives : -- Cheapest price-point -- Firm hold on ipod -LRB- even when in landscape mode -RRB- -- Attractive -- Ability to use Cover Flow Negatives : -- Rotation makes very terrible sound -LRB- not loud , but sounds like it 's stressing itself a TON -RRB- -- Removing ipod from dock often inadvertently initiates rotation -LRB- without pressing button -RRB- -- \*\* Audio quality extremely lacking \*\* : Terribly sterile\/tinny sounding . I also have an iHome , and it 's MUCH warmer sounding than this . The bass boost option makes basically zero difference . This is `` fine '' since I only use it in my office , at extremely low volumes , so audio quality is n't as important . I 'm definitely not very happy about this aspect , though . Neutral statement : Nobody should be concerned with how loud it can get . You 're buying a small ipod dock , not a full-blown stereo system . Get real . Bottom line : Outstanding value , but know that you 're buying a \* budget \* item , and sacrifices are inherent in purchasing budget items . In this case , they 've sacrificed any semblance of audio quality , but at least I can afford it . 	Speaker
Loved this item because the power button and volume control are on the outside ... letting you adjust the setting w\/o unzipping the item . This also has two velcro straps on the back , allowing you to attach to different items like bikes , backpacks etc. . Has good sound quality and only uses AAA batteries . 	Speaker
I dont know if I just got a bad one or what . I certainly didnt hesitate buying after reading all these good reviews . But im going to give you my 2 cents . I loved the monitor at first , it was clear bright and crisp . But then I noticed the speakers were crackly and fuzzy . Not sure what that was all about , but I didnt plan to use them anyway . Then I started noticing the light bleeding around the edges . ESPECIALLY the bottom . That alone made me want to return it . It seemed to be getting worse and when your screen is black or a dark color , with whatever your doing . -LRB- playing games -RRB- . You WILL notice it . Then I noticed a dead pixel in the top left yesterday that wasnt there before . That did it for me . Its back in its box waiting to be take to the ups drop off box for a refund . I will be purchasing a 22 inch samsung LED 1080p for about $ 50 more and im sure it will be worth it . Could have been a FANTASTIC monitor . But it didnt meet my expectations . 	Speaker
No one can hear me when I try to use the speaker phone . Conferencing the two lines together -LRB- which was one of the reasons I bought the phone -RRB- is impossible due to a lot of buzzing . If the phone worked as advertised , it would n't be bad . 	Speaker
Got it to work on Arch Linux right out of the box . Used alsa and asoundconf . . all I had to do was change the default soundcard to the speaker , listed as `` default '' on my laptop . I am using a Thinkpad T400 and this speaker is 10x better than the built-in speakers . I 'm very pleased with this product ! 	Speaker
I have owned the monitor for a few weeks now , and it has performed flawlessly . I use it as my computer monitor . I do not watch movies on it , and I have not used the built-in speakers . My monitor came with no dead or stuck pixels . Amazon shipped the monitor in its original box from Asus . It was left on my doorstep by the delivery person . I am glad no one saw it there and ran off with it . Attaching the base to the monitor is very easy and requires no tools . The base attaches securely , and is fairly stable . The monitor 's screen has a matte finish , but the bezel around the outside of the monitor is glossy . Fortunately , the bezel is thin and unobtrusive . A single -LRB- thankfully dim -RRB- LED indicates the status of the monitor . Overall , I like the plain , unobtrusive styling of the monitor . I looked at monitors from a number of manufacturers , before choosing this monitor , and many have unnecessary cheap-looking details . E.g. , a silver stripe along the bottom edge of a Dell monitor and a bright LED and lots of clear plastic around the edges of a Samsung monitor . This monitor has various display modes . Color balance and contrast are very different with each mode . sRGB and Standard modes work best for normal desktop use . I originally used sRGB mode , but the monitor was too bright in my relatively dimly lit room . There does not seem to be a way to adjust things like brightness and contrast , except in Standard mode -LRB- but I could be missing something -RRB- . No matter , Standard mode offers a wide range of adjustments , and I was quickly able to adjust the display to my liking . The control buttons along the bottom edge of the monitor are no more or less intuitive that those of other monitors I have used in the past . The viewing angle is as good as other monitors I 've looked at in this price range . I have owned and used a number of LCD monitors over the years , and I do not think that this monitor displays any more ghosting than these others . Perhaps there are higher-priced monitors that do not suffer from any ghosting-like artifacts , but I suspect that this monitor is just as good as others in its price range . This is a good monitor . Regarding ghosting , I watched a number of YouTube videos that show the `` ghosting problem '' with this monitor . The ghosting was actually more pronounced when I watched these videos on my old HP LCD monitor than when I watched them on my new Asus monitor . I suppose this means that my old monitor -LRB- which was very expensive when I bought it -RRB- had more of a ghosting problem than this monitor . It does not pay to obsess over these things . For the price , this looks to be a very good monitor , and I have no reservations recommending it to others . 	Speaker
This is a great phone . It had all the features I was looking for -- 2 lines , conf , call waiting , call id , transfer , mute , headset jacks , volume , ringer on\/off . The only problem is that you can not turn off the ringer on the handset . If your talking on one line and another call comes through on the other , it rings loudly in your ear . I called Tech Support and you can not turn this off -- only to hi or low volume -LRB- and ` low ' is n't that low -RRB- . If it were n't for this , I 'd recommend it highly . 	Speaker
Just got these unpacked and set up - and all I can say is Wow ! . Be prepared to be wowed . Have not heard any multimedia speakers that sound this good . A bit more expensive than others - but think they are worth it . Only drawback was I wish they came in white too . 	Speaker
the speaker was exactly as described , I love it ! they were received very quickly , great shipping ! Great product , batteries last forever w\/great sound ! at an amazing price ! thank you 	Speaker
As long as you have realistic expectations , these are great little speakers . They are well-suited for listening to your MP3 player at the office or in a hotel room -- anywhere that low volume listening is appropriate . They wo n't rock your house party , but you really should n't expect them to for the price . 	Speaker
as said before this is not a surround sound amazing system with bumpin base , BUT it is great for the price & just what i needed . sound quality of a clock radio or cd player works for me just fantastically . small and easy to use , the buttons are kinda cheap but not an issue for me . overall , this is an awesomely cheap way to be able to listen to ur ipod at home in the bathroom , kitchen , or bedroom or at work at ur desk . i recommend it ! : -RRB- 	Speaker
I bought this to pair with the new Denon AVR-1712 also bought from Amazon and I have no buyer 's remorse to start with . The audio is clear and sharp , bass is perfect , more so can be controlled by controls in sub-woofer . A good receiver -LRB- like Denon AVR 1712 -RRB- will make justice in buying these speakers . Denon 's ouptut is seamless and perfect with Polk speakers . I also have a Sony basic Home theater which pales in comparison . Very solid speakers , stylish and does not have that cheap look ... HD movies from HBO sounds awesome . For crystal clear life like Midrange Bose is the best . I would say Polk comes very very close or equal to it as i was hearing the sound from Syfy HD channel . It was almost like the person was sitting live in front of the TV and talking to us . Perfect bass and sharpness for the voice . Incredible ! I was so happy that i saved money from not buying Bose . 	Speaker
I thought I was getting a deal on these headphones but no matter how little you pay for these ... it is not worth it . 	Speaker
Hooked these speakers to an Onkyo 606 receiver and could not be happier . I have a small room and they are more than capable of filling every inch . 	Speaker
I bought this for my iPhone 4 . The phone will fit inside the cradle though is not firmly held in place . The one time that I placed the iPhone 4 inside the cradle the phone became very hot -LRB- temperature -RRB- . I now use the speaker with the supplied extension audio cable . It works OK this way . 	Speaker
My Kef Q900 speakers shipped all the way to hawaii , $ 145 shipping EACH from another site -LRB- a4l -RRB- and they arrived in perfect shape . But I agree there 's less foam in the box than there were in my $ 420 bic acoustech pl79 speakers that I upgraded to the Kefs from . But these speakers are truly great , I just got into home theater and went from onkyo home theater in a box speakers to pioneer SP-FS51-LR speakers , to bic acoustech pl79 to kef q900 , with greater costs each time and I finally stopped at the Kef q900s . . They fully satisfy my cravings for rich detailed sound . . outdoing my sennheiser hd595 headphones , which was my true yardstick since I did n't have high end speakers before . I ca n't even imagine better sound from speakers unless you get into the 50 '' tall 200 pound $ 9000 a pair rich audiophile territory 	Speaker
Just bought this from Amazon . The sound is astounding ! It makes my music sound like I have full surround sound . And , I have a Mac . Easy installation and easy use . I can still use my Mac buttons to control the speaker . So far , I love it . It is also bigger than one would think . I have a 17 '' Mac screen and this almost covers the entire top . 	Speaker
"When I received this box and saw how small it was -- I was a little leary wondering how such a little set of speakers and sub-woofer would come through . I wanted to replace a much bulkier system that had extremely long and cumbersome wires and a sub-woofer twice as big . I loved the sound of this set but noticed some hum coming from the wiring to the sub-woofer . I realized that it had to be a grounding issue on my side and it seems to have dissipated . When I got all of my volume controls set up , I was pleased to hear some beautiful <ahref=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002FB63UI/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/177-8365819-3451817""> The Art Of The Guitar - Sabicas -LRB- Digitally Remastered -RRB- </a> Sabicas Flamenco to test the highs and the lows . While this does not have the same sound quality of my larger system -LRB- a Scott surround sound system -RRB- it is also very different . The Logitech Z313 speakers are small and light and made of plastic through and through . The speakers are very nice looking and will compliment most towers or notebooks today with a silver and black design . The sub-woofer is much more sturdy and smaller than most . This is great if you want to use this system with your docked laptop . Do n't expect the world out of this system - you wo n't be paying a bundle , this is an economical system for sure . But expect compactness , crisp sound quality for what these are and a great price . Definitely not high end ... but for a general speaker set and sub-woofer for a laptop or desktop , good stuff ! You 'll also enjoy the little pod remote -LRB- which is unfortunately attached to another wire on the system , thus making it more difficult to maneuver -RRB- to control volume and on\/off functions . It 's cute and functional . The reason for 4 stars was that I found the pod to maneuver and wished it was wired alone instead of attached to the sub-woofer . A little awkward for me . I did like the placement of the headphone jack on the pod . A nice feature indeed . 4 stars . "	Speaker
Speakers sounds great . Received producted without the required `` y '' cable . Had to make my own . 	Speaker
I 'm very pleased with this product . The portable speakers sound great , and enough for it 's size . You can fit any Ipod on them . Charged it can last up to 10 hours on mid volume , if you have it on full volume they will last less than 5 hours . The size and portability is great , you can fit it in a back pack or a small bag , and place them almost anywhere for listening . The case is very good and provides excelent protection . It contains space for the usefull remote control . 	Speaker
This product is great , especially if you are just into getting a basic sound system for your computer . Easy to hook up , multiple accessories -LRB- iPod\/Mp3 player holder -RRB- , and sounds great . I have watched multiple action films on this computer using the sound system and I feel like I am really there . I have watch real battle footage from Iraq on the internet , and put the volume up to see how `` realistic '' it sounded , obviously no bullet were whizzing by my head but the sound was impeccable . The small arms fire to the mortar rounds , to the low bass of the .50 cal . Very nice . 	Speaker
Well , a friend of mine 's got the tower without the bluetooth feature , and it was really awesome so for a long time i was willing to buy a tower from this particular brand , 30 extra dolars for the bluetooth feature isnt bad at all . I got it today , it works great , great sound for its size and price , I understand that the volume for iPhone and the towers own volume are two different things that should be placed at the right measures to get the better sound quality so I do n't complain for the fact of the remote not being able to control my iPhone , I highly recommend this tower . 	Speaker
I 'm an audio-visual technician and use several of these speakers for things like multimedia installations or piped-in music -LRB- which they are actually quite good for -RRB- . The reason I 'm writing this review is because these speakers suffer from what I consider to be a major design flaw that , curiously , does n't appear to bother any of the other reviewers , yet deserves mention . Specifically : these speakers go into a `` sleep '' or `` standby '' mode when no -LRB- or very low -RRB- audio is detected that causes them to `` wake '' with a very annoying `` pop '' when they receive a signal . It 's not as severe as the woofer-distending `` thump '' these things make when powered on\/off -LRB- another obvious flaw that others have noted -RRB- , however it 's very noticeable and actually cuts off a portion of the audio that wakes it . This may not bother you , but if you -LRB- like me -RRB- enjoy listening to music , you may find it unacceptable . One other thing worth mentioning is that these are not a true stereo pair , but rather two individual speakers with separate controls each . If you require an accurate stereo image I recommend calibrating them with a split mono signal since the non-detented controls are inconsistent from unit to unit . In closing I 'd just like to say , when used in installed applications like I mentioned above , these sturdy speakers can provide years of trouble-free service . However I do not recommend them as computer stereo speakers , especially if you need to do any kind of critical listening . 	Speaker
I love this speakers , are so portable , the sound is great . very loud I was surprised with the excellent sound . What things may change : the power cord is very short and 3.5 mm is the connection over short . I have used them for only two days , but I could see a movie , listen to music and be heard in all my apartment excellently . Perhaps in an environment with more noise will not be as powerful , but small rooms is excellent . 	Speaker
We bought one to turn an old iphone we had lying around into a radio with Pandora for our babies room . Works Great ! Its a little more bass and a little less treble than I like but for the price its very good . 	Speaker
my wife and i are over 55 and have mild hearing loss . we have a relatively large open kitchen\/family room where we spend a great deal of time . our tv is approximately 30 ft or so from the kitchen in the family room . when my wife is cooking she likes to have the tv on , and she has to crank the tv volume way up so she can hear clearly . we wanted some way to add a wireless speaker in the kitchen so she could more easily hear without cranking up the tv volume . we bought the tv ears product with some hesitation as i was n't sure it was going to do what we hoped it would do . happy to say we were both very pleased with this product . took 5 minutes to set up . worked just like we had hoped . sound is now loud and clear in the kitchen , and we can keep the -LRB- main -RRB- tv volume at reasonable levels . i think that perhaps some of the negative reviews of this product were in situations where folks were hoping it would do more than they thought . all i can say is for our mild hearing issues , this product does exactly what it was supposed to do , and we 're -LRB- so far -RRB- very happy with it and would recommend it to others who are in a similar situation . 	Speaker
These are much smaller then I thought . The base the speaker sits on is only 4 inches sq. . They are pretty woobly on the carpet in my studio . I wo n't be able to use these though , because I needed stands for mid . sized monitors , these are designed for miniture sized speakers with not much more then a 4-5 in . base . They would cost about $ 4 to build and are made from less then a quarter of a sheet of medium density fiberboard . 	Speaker
The speakers sound great but only with our cell phones . The adapter we have on our pc works great with other bluetooth devices , but the speakers require their own adapter at a pricey $ 40 on older -LRB- 3 yr -RRB- pcs because of the audio protocol they use . Besides , their bluetooth adapter only works within 10m while ours works within 100m . I could n't find a place to download the protocol anywhere . Oh well , too good to be true . 	Speaker
I ordered this speaker because the more I read about them the more I found people loved them . It is true , this speaker is awesome ! Not only that , but it sounds better than any of the speakers that cost 3 or 4 times as much -LRB- in my opinion -RRB- . 	Speaker
My wife and I travel a lot together . We use this splitter to watch movies on our playbook and listen to music on our iPod . Fits well and sound good . sound volume drop is unnoticeable . 	Speaker
I have used many PC speakers in my day Bose , Logitech , many more . None can equal the sound and power that these 2.1 speakers can produce . The bass is so powerful they startle you at first you would not think such a small subwoofer can create such bass . I can safely say these are the best 2.1 speakers on the market today . 	Speaker
Love this speaker . Sounds awesome . Works super easy . Looks great . Seems to be durable enough but I 've only had it a few weeks so we 'll see . My only complaint is like others here ... it randomly disconnects from the bluetooth and it 's really annoying when it does because it does it so often . If it did n't do that , it would be perfect . Because of that though , I am tempted to send it back . 	Speaker
I could not do without my garmin street pilot , however I have to replace speaker and plug in , the unit has not been used enough have to replace design weakness . 	Speaker
I am very pleased with this set of speakers . No hastle hookup . just plug in to usb and away you go . Great sound , good quality materials . Very easy to use and store . I would recommend to anyone looking for aux speakers for their laptop . 	Speaker
I would n't use these as mains or anything , but as inexpensive in-ceiling surround speakers they are perfect . I have an open attic above my listening area so these were even easier to install than if there was a floor above . The downside to that however is that there is no cabinet for the speaker . If you put it in a wall or in a ceiling where there is a floor above it , the wall cavity becomes the cabinet . If you put as I did backed into an attic space , you lose the resonance that a cabinet would supply unless you built one around the speaker . So , with that in mind , I 've not heard these speakers properly encased , but since I am just using them for surround sound speaker , the upper mids given off by the woofer and everything from the tweeters is sufficient . Maybe someday I 'll decide to box them in from behind ... but I doubt I 'll ever bother . One thing I did notice however is the aimable tweeter , while it seems necessary to get the sound where you want it , does n't really direct the treble as directly as you 'd expect . It 's still a domed tweeter so the sound radiates 360 ' around the tweeter ... Aiming it just sorta maybe gives you a bit of a sweet spot . For $ 100 for the pair , you ca n't go wrong . Oh yeah , I did have some difficulty getting the grills off without elongating a tiny hole . They say to use a corkscrew or paper clip , stick it in a grill hole and pull the grill off . It works , but I did damage one of the tiny holes in the process . Not really noticeable , but it does sort of interrupt the smoothness of the speaker grill when the light hits it right . I understand why they did it that way - no visible mounting once the grill is in place - but maybe include a little tool in the packaging to pull the screen off without damaging it would be a nice idea . 	Speaker
If ever you are looking for the best sound and clarity this product has it , Bose systems are the best ! 	Speaker
Have not put speakers up yet but I like what I see . Plenty of hardware included for all types of speakers and various installations . I have a Bose Lifestyle system so I am going to ceiling mount the for corner speakers . These brackets are well designed and a lot less expensive than the Bose brackets . 	Speaker
Purchased this little speaker system two weeks ago after I received my first iPhone . If you are a person who is very knowledgeable about sound , I ca n't add anything of interest to you in this review , but if you are simply a casual music listener like me , and just want to listen to your favorite songs at your desk or while doing the dishes at home , this is a very decent system , especially for the price . It delivers good solid sound at my vanity table and office desk , as well as in my living room , and yes , I 've toted it around that much already . It 's sturdy , compact and folds up beautifully with a magnetic lock when you close it to move it about . Frankly , I am a bit amazed they can deliver this quality for the price . Despite its ease of portability , I 'm purchasing another one just so I wo n't have to move it everyday . 	Speaker
I had to send it back and reorder because the first one quit working after less than 1 day . If the next one will work , it should be an OK product . 	Speaker
These speakers work beautifully . i 've had them for a while now in my '99 Toyota Corolla and havent had a complaint . 	Speaker
Was going to go the route of the Bose environmental speakers b\/c all my speakers inside are Bose , but for the money , could n't pass these up . Got them installed , they look super clean . The sound they produce is great . Only complaint I have had is from my neighbor who says that the noise is too loud . These things really pump out some sound , great bass . The ole neighbors will just have to learn to like my music ; - -RRB- . 	Speaker
For 6  9s these speakers sound like a sub on the bass never heard 6  9s with the lows they can pick up now the only thing I wish these speakers could do is get louder on the highs with out distorting even with the frequency level set to match the speakers on my amp they still have a hard time with high volume but they are still well built and high quality speakers would have 5 star rated these if only they could handle better at high volume besides that JBL speakers are top of the line 	Speaker
I purchased this to float the lazy river in Aruba and it was perfect . We attached it to our floating cooler and we were set . 	Speaker
My tusty Sony phone of 10 years recently had to say good-bye . I searched all over for a phone which would take its place and not put me in debt . I heard great things about this AT&T phone but was very disapointed when I got it home . I immediately set it up and did some test calls . No matter who I called or where in my house I stood I heard nothing but static . The person on the other end could hear me fine , but what 's the point in calling someone if you ca n't hear what they have to say . This phone stinks !! I recommend it to no one . Save you 're money and keep shopping . 	Speaker
I have four of these speakers . Of those four , one is defective . The volume is n't as loud as the other three speakers , but if you tinker with the volume wheel you can eventually get it to sound as loud as the others , considering you do n't touch the volume wheel or move the speaker too much . From this , just know that there 's a small chance you 'll get a defective speaker . I can not comment on return policy since the defective one was a gift . Of the ones that do work , expect surprisingly loud sound . Turn your MP3 player , iPhone , etc. to max volume and turn the speaker to max volume and , trust me on this , you will be surprised by how loud this little speaker is . Plus , it has its own headphone jack to plug into your music player , phone , etc. so you do n't need a separate one . All you need to do to charge is to plug it into your computer 's USB with the included cable and the battery lasts a long time . I also like how if you buy two or more you can connect them to each other to play music through all connected speakers . I really recommend this speaker for gifts . I take it everywhere I go . 	Speaker
UPDATE : original review is below . Having owned these for some time I could n't deal with what seemed to be a pronounced and peaky midrange . Oddly , 5.1 mixes sounded good , but standard stereo 2 ch -LRB- like iTunes , running from my Mac with optical output -RRB- were way too midrangey . Certain vocals sounded excellent , the projection of voice and detail were more than one would expect from $ 100 speakers . So , for their price I still say they are excellent , especially if you like music with vocals and acoustic accompaniment . But I just rec 'd some HSU HB-1 MK2s and they blow these Polks away for midrange and lower midrange , and imaging . They mate better to Polk 's own subwoofer -LRB- only need 1 , now -RRB- and finally I do n't have the listening fatigue that I had with these Polks . Think of these speakers as loud and crystal clear , and you 'll be fine . -LRB- original review -RRB- These speakers surprised me as they seemed so lacking in bass . But the projection and midrange and high-end detail of these things is truly , for the price , astounding . But if you want the whole scene , you will have to get a subwoofer . However , the sheer presence of these things is so much closer to being at a live show than any speakers I have heard of . And they 're so balanced ; yes , they have a very powerful midrange , but there is no distortion . And the stereo separation is so clean . For $ 300 , I have never heard anything near them . Still , I would reccomend getting a subwoofer as I was surprised by their lack of bass ; however , the bass they present is totally accurate -- it 's just not big ; but it 's accurate . I really love these speakers , even without a subwoofer , and that 's what sold me -- eventually I 'll get a sub , but even without it , I just love their sound . 	Speaker
The only reason I did n't give these speakers 5 stars is : 1 -RRB- the sound is marginal 2 -RRB- wish they were wireless Believe it or not , those two reasons do n't compare to the awesomeness of the LOOK of these speakers ! I hung them up on the poles holding up pergola ... they literally look like tiki heads\/totem poles in my yard , and are particularly cool to see during a storm . The sound ? Eh . Needs more lows . Maybe they would sound better placed on the ground rather than hung . It also would be helpful if the speaker wire was n't permanently attached to the speakers , though they are very good quality wires for outdoor use . I 've only had them a few weeks but the speakers have already been exposed to some nasty thunderstorms and they still work fine . I 'm really glad I purchased these . Delivery was quick and they really add a lot of personality to my yard . I 'm sure they 'll be a conversation-starter at my next party . 	Speaker
Just bought 2 , 1 month ago and am adding 2 more . great out of the box . can only get better . matched with omd c1 center . omdr rear . velodyne sub . Yamaha rxv 1800 . great soundstage . omdr adds depth compared to omd 5 's . great value for the money spent compared to others . superb construction and finish . 	Speaker
The sound from the Companion 5 is very good . Outstanding in my opinion . And setup is so easy its hard to believe . Plug the speakers into their coded inputs , plug in the ac , plug the usb into the computer . Windows 7 automatically loaded the drivers in a matter of seconds and selected the Bose as the default speakers . Nothing to do but start playing music . The control cluster is really cool also . One touch to mute and a nice tactile feel to the volume dial . These are expensive for computer speakers but computers are n't just computers any more . This system is worth every penny . Highly recommended . 	Speaker
The picture is excellent -LRB- it replaced an HP 19 '' standard monitor -RRB- ... all text is crisp and sharp - No dead pixels , no pixel problems of any sort ... 	Speaker
I have to return this sub and replace it with JBL ES250PBK , it is just too small for my system , if I crank it up to full volume then it rattles and give me a distorted sound , it was my mistake that I went the cheap side , but it will be a good one for small set ups and maybe with some Low freq . help from your front speakers . 	Subwoofer
I bought this V-80 to complement a pair of Athena B1 .2 -LRB- great little speakers -RRB- in a small home theater setup . I was not expecting much more than a subtle improvement . Wow , was I shocked ... tight and clean bass , very musical , louder and lower than I had hoped , set at well less than its max output . With crossover control set to about 80hz it blends perfectly with the Athenas . I have very high standards when it comes to subwoofers , using an HSU VTF-2 for my main music system . I can not stand boomy , non-musical subs . The Bic V-80 is not boomy , plays tight and fast and musical and is excellent for a small room . Highly recommended . 	Subwoofer
the boss audio phantom 15 inch subwoofer is a very good sub for the price bought two for my home studio first one i got with in a week and it sounded great has one year long warenty apon purchase date i hap bought a duel 15 inch enclosure with a 3inch port even with just one in the box and plugging the other hole didnt even have it wired to 4 ohm had it wired to 8 ohm and it still hit hard very hard ive owned compitetion subs that didnt hit this hard make sure to break in for a good month or to befor you realy slam it . the only problem i had was that the second on i got had been dropped in shipping and was broke when i got it but was replaced promptly by amazon witch i thank them for overall i giv it a four for the price will be getting more 	Subwoofer
I bought these speakers for a few reason , primarily because the speakers I had earlier from when I first got this computer finally died . R.I.P. . So I went shopping for speakers with a specific budget in mind . Music is my life , and until I can afford a 300 dollar sound system I needed something to sate my musical bloodlust and for the price these did just that . The bass is overpowering for my room , which is pretty small given , but the sound quality is amazing and I 've also heard those stories about how the speakers crackle when you turn them up . Let me tell you , that is no urban legend and is true on some speakers . Presentation wise they look AWESOME . The blue see through blue lit speakers look fantastic , and if the sub woofer was n't on the ground due to lack of space on my desk im sure the blue presentation on the volume and bass controls would be equally as impressive . These speakers are bass friendly , but not so much on the treble . All in all , for the price these speakers are great for anyone on a budget but still want bang for their buck ! Everything was packaged well and arrived in 5 days in perfect working order . No complaints here for these gems . Happy listening ! Hope this helps someone on the middle of the fence to get these ! Always read your reviews ! 	Subwoofer
I had to immediately write this review because it is just that great ! I ordered this for Christmas for my 13 yr old daughter for her room after reading the great reviews . I just received it and opened it up to check it out before wrapping it . It is now an hour later after I have played with it listening to my own ipod -LRB- from 70 's rock to club music -RRB- . Sound and bass is incredible for price and size . You can turn it all the way up without distortion and enough volume to rock a good sized bedroom . It can be heard with the door closed all the way to the other end of the house . It sounds like a regular stereo is playing when you walk by the closed door . Very cute design and simple . This is waaaay better than the brand new Sony cd\/ipod player I have in my bathroom -LRB- which is much bigger & was a gift -RRB- . Also , to let you know , I am a little picky . I have mostly Klipsch speakers inside and outside . It would be nice to have adjustments for mids , bass & treble , but for most music it really is great for what it is . This is a little smaller than a size # 4 soccer ball . I do have concerns about the exposed speaker on the bottom being damaged if dropped . I probably will be buying one for myself . Also , this would be great for the garage\/work-out room . For transport , I guess you could save the box which has a handle . Perfect sound for vacationing . I would love to hear this against a JPL Onstage or Bose docking stations . Great purchase ! 	Subwoofer

While the Sony 's had a remote and headphone jacks built in , I went with the Harman Kardon 's for a couple of reasons : One , the Soundsticks III went down in price to $ 116 , while the Sony 's were still around $ 170 . Another reason is that the speakers and woofer for the Sony system looked huge ! Lastly , they 're really , really , ridiculously good-looking . Now let 's just get some things straight , this is a set of computer\/iPod speakers ; they will not replace a 5.1 system or studio monitors for that matter -LRB- musicians\/audio mixers should already know this -RRB- . However , if you 're someone who enjoys listening to music , watching movies , and playing games on a smaller screen and want clean , beautiful sound with great bass response -LRB- which you can fine tune according to your tastes -RRB- then you simply ca n't do any better at this price point . Get them , you wo n't be disappointed ! "	Subwoofer
These cables are so well made you 'd think Monster made them but you do n't pay the Monster price . I have always looked for MediaBridge cables when searching for new ones whether it be networking , subwoofer , HDMI etc. . I had one cable go bad on me and when I asked MediaBridge company about it they promptly sent me a new one without hesitiation . Companies come and go but MediaBridge will always be around due to their great customer service , thanks . 	Subwoofer
My AS-P4000 amplifier fried 1 week before the 1 year warranty was over -LRB- thank god -RRB- . The rest of the components carry a 5 year warranty but I was worried from the day I bought it . I use the speaker-in inputs as opposed to the line-in because my receiver does n't have a sub-out -LRB- O.K. , I know , time for a new receiver -RRB- . Anyway , I did n't push this thing very hard so was very surprised to discover it was n't working one day . I like and own other Athena speakers but probably would n't buy another of their subs . In any event , they 've been bought out by Klipsch -LRB- since Klipsch bought API who owns Athena -RRB- . 	Subwoofer
If you want something that looks just as amazing as it sounds , do n't hesitate on this one . The speakers look Better in person , which I did n't think was possible ! And the sound quality ? Above par . I 'm a Dubstep lover , and this system delivers it all at any volume level . And When I want to listen to my Songs of Nature , It truly feels like I am sleeping among the stars . The only little gripe is the fact that the sound is a lot clearer\/louder only when you are in the direct line of the speakers - but if you 're in a smaller room like I am , it does n't really make a difference . I 'm in love , and you will be too . 	Subwoofer
FREAKING SPEAKERS BLEW AFTER ONE DAY OF INSTALLATION GOT THE AMP TESTED ITS PERFECTLY FINE FALSE ADVERTISEMENT ON WATTAGE RESISTENCE AMP WASNT EVEN ON MAX 	Subwoofer
I am an audio enthusiast and I love these speakers ! They have excellent clarity and balance without being too tinny or bassy . The best part is how incredibly small they are . I bought them because I have a 27 '' imac and not much room for speakers on my desk . These little things are so small , and yet plenty powerful . The sub is quite a bit bigger than the sattelite speakers but I have it under my desk . Only 1 word of caution is that the cables between the 3 speakers are pretty short so you do n't have a lot of options as far as placement around a desk go . 	Subwoofer
I got the 35 foot subwoofer cable so I could place my Polk Audio 505 sub behind my home theater sectional . This feels sturdy and is priced just right . I would recomend this cable even if you just need something shorter get this one that way if later you need someting longer you will already have it . I did not use the Y adaptor but its nice that it comes with it . Great product ! 	Subwoofer
This is a great subwoofer with all sorts of power and easy adjusments with switches and knobs on the back . I read several reviews that tested this subwoofer against much more expensive brands and this one was always as good or better and cost half as much . The reason I only gave it 4 stars was because of the frustration that a sticker on the speaker screen gave me -LRB- yes this is a petty complaint -RRB- . It would not come off even when applying some heat -LRB- I actually think this made the sticker glue stick better -RRB- . I would have left it on but it was crooked and looked bad . I ended up using a black marker to cover what I could not get off . The other thing is that the power cord does not plug in securely to the back of the unit . Not a real problem unless you have animals or small children -LRB- same thing -RRB- that may knock it loose . Despite these two small problems I would definately recomend this subwoofer for both home theater and music listening . 	Subwoofer
This is an excellant unit and meets all my expectations . I am not music connoisseur , but the unit adds a demension that was missing from my old unit at a very reasonable cost . Great value . 	Subwoofer
I am not suprised these speakers have almost all 5 star reviews . You would n't expect good sound from such a cheap speaker as these perform . They are simply amazing . Crystal clear audio with amazing bass . Use these speakers and play Lord of the Rings and I guarantee you will be amazed . Anyways , there 's not much more to say than they are pretty amazing and it will actually feel like your in the movie . I got mine for 50 shipped I think and I am suprised they are going for 200 now . Maybe I paid that but I do n't think I paid over 50 for them a while back . I want to get them again but do n't want to pay that much , even though I think that 's about on par with their quality ... 	Subwoofer
I bought one of these subs several years ago and am continually amazed by the quality for the cost . I have heard subs in stores costing over $ 300 that I honestly thought sounded similar to this sub . The important features are not forgotten about , either . There are RCA and speaker ins\/and outs for both high gain and low gain inputs . The crossover is very useful , which I usually set quite low , around 70Hz for that really deep sound . And at 125-watts , although it wo n't blast your neighbors off their porch , this guy can really start shaking the walls when you turn it up . In addition , it is a really great looking sub , especially with the blue lights on the feet . I have been into subs for quite some time , and I am challenged to find a better deal on any entry level sub . In addition , I would bet that you could convince most people that this is a sub worth multiple times what you bought it for . 	Subwoofer
I replaced a 12 ft. monster with this Acoustic Reasearch cable and more than doubled the sound out of my subwoofer . I will never use Monster products again . I was always complaining about the subs I had and finally bought an Earthquake subwoofer and still was not satisfied . But after the Acoustic research cable went on , I realized it was a cable problem . I will stay with AC . products from now on . Curt 	Subwoofer
this sub is great for the $ for the $ you cant beat it . i highly recommend getting it . it has awesome lows !! cant go wrong with polk audio !! plus free shipping on amazon ! 	Subwoofer
Have a smaller version of this for my Desk top Computer . Works good . I needed a bigger system for my laptop to be used in a bigger room . So I ordeder this one . When it arrived , One speaker did n't work . Sound level was so low I could n't hear it . Returned it and new one arrived in 2 days . Sound quality is good but Volumn level is just barely adequate for larger room . Some where I saw it ratted at 140 watts . But I would rate it at between 10 and 20 watts . 	Subwoofer
This subwoofer kicks fine but if you wanna FEEL your bass this is not for you , the bass rings in your ear rather than rumble your body . Even on a ministereo -LRB- panasonic -RRB- it distorts badly when you turn up the volume . I ordered a different subwoofer the next day ! Take my advice , this sub will hurt your ears more than it will entertain you . Consider something else . 	Subwoofer
I bought this for my 13-year-old son , and it 's perfect for the price . It was easy to setup , and it 's easy to use -LRB- he especially loves the rotary volume control -RRB- . The sub-woofer creates a good strong bass , but my wife and I love the fact that the total power output is not enough to bring down the house . If you 're looking for a system for a true audiophile , this is not it -LRB- because of the limited power output -RRB- . But if you 're looking for a good system for a child or teenager , this is a good choice . 	Subwoofer
"These are visually stunning , but they did n't sounds nearly as beautiful as they look . I ordered both the <ahref=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001S14DYO/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/181-7501666-5227867""> Creative GigaWorks T40 Series II 2.0 Multimedia Speaker System with BasXPort Technolgy </a> and these . I was so hoping that the Harman Kardon would sound better because they looked amazing on my desk , but alas , the Creative speakers sounded much fuller . You 'd think the Creative 's would n't sound as good because they do n't have a separate subwoofer , but that was n't the case . I mostly listen to music through my computer -LRB- Pandora , Zune , etc. -RRB- I am not sure if these would sound better with a different setup , but I 'm not about to go out and buy a new sound card to try it out . Also , I found the touch controls annoying to use . I much prefer manual controls where I can tell what the volume is going to be before I turn on the speakers . With manual controls there are fewer surprises and less fiddling with the controls in order to get the right sound each time . "	Subwoofer
These things are awesome for starter speakers !! Man I love all kinds of music and I went on a youtube spree after getting these ! For 50 $ they are great ! I personally love the blue LED lighting , but I could tell for some it might be a tad bit bothersome because they are so bright and in your face ! I do n't know where to write about the shipping but I would give it a 1\/5 if I could . The guy from Ontrack actually DROPPED my box on the ground after getting it off the van . He slid the door open to the van , dropped one box of mine in the grass -LRB- containing these speakers -RRB- and then dropped my other box on top of it . I was so angry , why the heck would you handle other peoples ' packages like that ? Keep a close eye on how they handle your packages if it 's `` Ontrack '' delivering it . So far it seems no damage has been done though , but I have n't tested out the other stuff that came in my boxes . 	Subwoofer

My OEM Chevy Suburban sub speaker dry rotted and I bought this for a replacement . Unexpectedly Chevrolet had made a custom size OEM speaker . The chevy speaker is rated at 2ohms . The mounting points protrude beyond the standard 8 '' speaker size and they are slim in depth . I had to mod the sub box to make the speaker fit and the legacy speaker is rated at 4ohms . The speaker works but is not as loud do to the ohm 's change . Its not Legacys fault its chevy way of making go back to the dealer for parts . You can order the OEM speaker from chevrolet for a hefty price of $ 150 . 	Subwoofer
I 'm not an audiophile but I definitely appreciate quality sound and craftsmanship . This is without a doubt the best set of under $ 200 desktop speakers you can buy . Amazing clarity , great volume , super good looks , and a very reasonable price . 	Subwoofer
Worked for a few months , then started making a popping noise when not fed by the receiver , then it simply stopped working and only makes popping noise . Probably same problem others reported . $ 200 to waste since it ca n't be repaired and Infinity refuses to fix it . What a custimer focus they have . Never will buy from them again . 	Subwoofer
This cable is very nice . I was using a very thin what seemed like it had zero shielding inside and probably 25 feet or more in length generic subwoofer cable that came with a yamaha home theater in a box . I bought this cable and it sure looks high quality . The connector on the end is actually very long where it sticks out which I think is a good thing , it has a split center tip and very strong gold connectors around that the cable is flexible and has a directional marking for the signal direction . The cable has solid core conductors 2 of them according to the packaging and is shielded . I do n't think any other cable would have much more edge of this one . The price and quality exceed my expectations and I feel my polk psw111 subwoofer should be getting as true of a bass signal to the amp as can be . 	Subwoofer
i use this to hook up my receiver to my energy take classic 5.1 sub , and it does a damn good job . Looks good , sounds good , 10\/10 would buy again and \/ or recommend . 	Subwoofer
This subwoofer is awesome ! I never thought it would sound so good , especially when I played a movie ! This thing raddles the floor ! This is very similar sounding to my Logitech Z-2300 PC speakers . I am running a 35foot subwoofer cable from the 630watt Sony Receiver all the way around my bow window , to the back of the living room . From there I have a Y cable that converts the subwoofer cable into left , right RCA cables . I put the subwoofer underneath the lamp stand facing the woofer toward the couch . Works great with music to , would recommend this to EVERYONE ! Thanks Polk Audio and Amazon once again for your great service , and 3-5 years warranty . 	Subwoofer
Not much experience in audio equipment , but this worked just fine to connect my receiver to subwoofer . Initially I was confused which input of my sub to connect it to since it had both a left and right input , but a quick look of the sub instructions said to connect to the left input . Does it job for a good price , no complaints . 	Subwoofer
Very muddy sounding bass . The enclosure itself though is pretty good , but you definately would want to buy another sub . 	Subwoofer
I had a similar Kenwood sub about 9-10 yrs ago I remember paying over twice as much for it and it did n't have the thump that this one does . The tube itself seemed quite large at first , but I had no problem with it fitting in my trunk . I have it firing back toward the rear of the car and it sounds sweet . It has a sensitivity level on the amp too , so it will blend in nicely with any system . You can pump it up just a little , or add some Magic Mike `` Bass Test '' and it WILL rattle your trunk , rear view mirror , and feel it outside of the car . Great price and great extra BASS !!

These speakers definitely do not disappoint . I could easily complain about how certain frequencies are slightly off but honestly , nothing is perfect . These speakers are elegant , sleek , and a fantastic centerpiece for any room . They completely defy the current perception of speakers , and they sound amazing . Obviously , if you 're a stickler for sound quality , you do n't want to be getting these , but if you 're just a normal person who likes music and having cool things in your presence , then these are your speakers . One of the best things about these speakers is how they have so many contemporary aspects to them - the silver cables , accent light inside the subwoofer , and touch-screen-esque buttons to control the volume . I 'm a big fan of how these speakers were designed , and they totally deserve to be in MOMA . 	Subwoofer
I built speaker cabinets as a hobby for a few years , because there was so much you could do , years ago , to improve on the existing products of the time , I think it 's a tough call anymore ... I have two of these and i 'm still grinning . I matched them up with the yam . 777s & center . The sound is really balanced , it 's too bad it took me 30 + yrs . to put such a nice sounding system together , and at pennies of what things cost in the 70s , Yamaha is a bargain ! -LRB- and I 'm a Suzuki fan -RRB- But ... I may need a brick house to hold these puppies . Two , may be overkill , but . . is there too much of a good thing ? The build quality looks to be great , it will have to be as these things are getting a work out . 	Subwoofer
I am impressed by this subwoofer , I have had this subwoofer for nine months now and have watched alot of movies and listened to alot of music with it and I like what I have bought . I have got this subwoofer hooked up to a Sony STR-DH800 reciever by RCA Monster cable with a right and left splitter to connect to the subwoofer . Since there is no LFE input I turned the low pass just about all the way up and have got the phase set to 0 . This makes enough bass to rattle things in the kitchen one room over , not to mention the picuters on the wall . The auto-on is nice , I have read that there is some lag time but I have not really noticed any . I am pleased with the Polk PSW10 subwoofer . 	Subwoofer
I am with everyone else that this little system is amazing . I bought it after returning a sony dock that just did n't do the job . Things I love - Easy to use and set up . Just plug it in , dock your ipod and turn his ` nose ' and you have music . Loud and not distorted . Sounds good at all volume levels . Looks cute . Things I wish I could change - I wish there were a way I could adjust for bass , mids , and treble , but for the price you just ca n't beat the sound anyway you look at it . The seller is also amazing . I got my gobuddy in 1 day from AZ to OH . I definitely recommend this product to everyone ! 	Subwoofer
I have to admit that I am sort of a Polk Audio fan . So I did not hesitate to buy this sub-woofer when I wanted to build my home theater system . A friend of mine actually bought this for his system and I got a chance to hear it before buying it . It would hit all the low end notes that were thrown its way . Pros : Affordable Nice Frequency Range Speaker Hook-Ups Nice Finish on both Black and Cherry Versions Auto\/on\/off switch Volume and Frequency Cut Off dials . 5 Year Warranty Cons : No LFE Entry Level Final Thoughts : The sub-woofer does need a break in period as does any speaker . This sub can really add that needed bass for any home system . Polk Audio quality is amazing and the warranty stands behind that statement . 	Subwoofer
There are almost endless reviews for this product on the internet , boasting about it 's quality . I am not here to challenge that . If you want 2.1 -LRB- 2 satellites , 1 woofer -RRB- speakers than there is really no other item on the market comparable in quality . HOWEVER !!!! If you are content with losing 1 of the 2 satellites within an unreasonably short time , go ahead and purchase these . The speakers themselves -- satellites and the woofer -- will most likely last an adequate amount of time . There will not be an issue with the items themselves . Rather , the female RCA input for either the left or right satellite will stop working . For me , the left speaker died within 4 years . For many others with the exact same issue , it was within the first 6 months . I bought these 4 years ago and enjoyed every second of their quality and impressive volume levels . However , there has yet to be a solution to this common and inevitable problem . One of the speakers will die and the issue will be either in the voice coil of the satellite in question , or an unexplainable lack of power running to the female RCA port . If you do n't know your way around circuitry , speakers specifically , than you will not be able to fix the problem on your own . Only after enlisting my mechanical engineering roommate was I able to fully identify the issue and , even then , the only remedy was buying a new , different product . This problem is peculiar in the way that the device itself will be fine , but the connection to it will be disrupted and the reason behind it will not come easy to you , regardless of your intelligence in this field . So , you will be hearing excellent , unparalleled sounds coming from the speakers , but you will be doing so on borrowed time until one piece of the 3 piece set flatlines . 	Subwoofer
I will tell you this , no i did not order from Amazon , cuz i got them from walmart but same exact sub . I have two of these under my trucks back seat and in all honestly , these babies slam and slam hard . they dont mess around . they are hooked up to a Kenwood 1000 watt max 300 watt rms . yeah its probly low compared to your super expensive set up but its good enough to make your voice change and even get a good massage : -RRB- 	Subwoofer

The key to appreciating this product is to have realistic expectations . It will NOT rattle the windows of nearby houses . It will NOT notify everyone within 200 feet that you 're listening to bumpin ' tunes . It will NOT give your sound system `` street cred '' or whatever . -LRB- Do people still use the phrase `` street cred '' any more ? Eh -- I 'm too old to care . -RRB- What it WILL do is deliver the clean , strong , deep bass that your factory speakers wo n't . Both cars for which I bought Basslinks came with a factory Bose system . And anyone who has a Bose system in their car knows that Bose tries to do too much with too little . It sounds pretty good at low volumes , but when you need to turn it up to overcome wind and tire noise at highway speeds , the speakers work too hard and the low frequencies get too muddy . That 's where the Basslink steps in . By using the frequency filters on my aftermarket head unit -LRB- both high-pass and low-pass -RRB- to cut out the lows from the factory speakers and send it all to the Basslink , I can now crank the stereo without overdriving the factory speakers while the Basslink jacks out thumpin ' bass without breaking a sweat at volumes that would completely overwhelm the factory speakers . Net result : much better , cleaner , and more filled-out sound at volumes high enough to overcome any amount of wind and tire noise . And the best part is that it takes up less room in my trunk than two bottles of antifreeze . It 's mounted upright and tucked away in a corner , barely even noticeable , and I still have about 95 % of my trunk space . Plus there 's no amp taking up extra space either -- the Basslink is a complete unit with a built-in amp . So if you need something to wake your neighbors up in the middle of the night thinking their roof is about to cave in , the Basslink wo n't work for you . But if you need something that can punch out the low frequencies with authority to `` fill out '' your factory system and do n't want to sacrifice trunk space , you will very pleased with this space-saving little bruiser .

I admit , I am disappointed in this product . However , it was a cheap price and I was hoping it would get me by until I could afford a better one . I 'm not pumping near the peek power to this speaker and it 's only been a couple of months since I bought it , and now it rattles when I hit certain notes . It still sounds better than the blown speaker it replaced . 	Subwoofer
For the price , these ca n't be beat . Obviously , they are not a top-end system . However , for less than a tank of gas , you 'll have a computer speaker system that will last for years . 	Subwoofer
I am quickly becoming a fan of Mediabridge products . They are priced right and well made . There is a lot of hype in the audio cable business , so you can pay significantly more for the same type of cable , but I think you would be hard-pressed to find a better bang for the buck . The quality , fit and finish of this product -LRB- Dual Shielded Subwoofer Cable - Dual Shielded Subwoofer Cable -RRB- is excellent and the sound quality it transmits is flawless . I highly recommend Mediabridge cables in general and this one in particular . 	Subwoofer

The books that Amazon ships are much better protected . Anyhow , I shipped that set back and requested a replacement set which just arrived . With the same damage to the subwoofer ! That indicates to me that the build quality of the subwoofer could be a lot more robust even with the sparse packaging . I 'll shop for a different product , probably from a box store as Amazon have n't mastered shipping these things ! "	Subwoofer

I love the subwoofer !!!!! I paired this subwoofer with Klipsh bookshelf and surround speakers , Onkyo receiver and it does n't skip a beat . The bass is clean with no distortion . If you are looking to buy a quality sub . This is the one to buy . 	Subwoofer
This subwoofer is worth every penny . Originally , I took two candidates Klipsh RW-12D or Polk Audio PSW-505 . My idea price for RW-12D is between $ 300 - $ 350 . I did not expect PSW-505 could on sale with price $ 199 with free shipping . Both subwoofers are name brand and U.S. made . I could not listen either of the sound . I compared as the following . Power : PSW505 - 300 watts RMS ; RW-12D - 340 Wats Frequency : PSW505 - 28 HZ - 125 HZ -3 db and 23 Hz - 160 Hz RW-12D - 24-120 Hz -3 DB Price : PSW505 -- $ 199 -LRB- $ 250 -RRB- RW-12D -- $ 437 -LRB- 405 +32 shipping -RRB- Control : PSW505 - analogy control ; RW-12D -- digital control Conclusion : Compare the above difference , the low-end frequency at -3 DB is only differing 4 Hz . The continuous power differed -LRB- 340-300 -RRB- 40 watts . However the price for Klipsh is 2.18 times of Polk Audio . For quality wise , they are so close each other . I prefer analog continuous control than the digital for low pass filter and volume . I decided to purchase Polk Audio PSW505 . I connected AudioSource 310 power amplifier and Gemini PA-7000 pre-amplifer to KEF 103.2 speaker . Again connected from AudioSource input\/output line 2 to PSW-505 . Originally , the AusioSource produced sound is crystal clear but very cool . After adding the PSW-505 , the sound becomes warm with very nature deep bass . It is unexpected good . Originally , my Yamaha amplifier produces much warmer sound than my Ausiosource 310 . Now the combined AudioSource 310 and PSW505 sound much better than my YAMAHA . The high frequency violin sound like silk , the vocal sound is very warm , the deep bass is very smooth . Anyway , I feel very satisfy with this combination . I highly recommend this PWS505 subwoofer . May be RW-12D sound slightly better than PSW505 but can never be better than 2 times as the price . 	Subwoofer
These speakers are color coded so you ca n't make a mistake whe attaching the cords to the speakers . The colors did ' t match those on the back of my computer but if you check the software that came with the soundcard or the paperwork , you should n't have much trouble figuring it out . The sound is great . I use the system to play games , to listen to music and to play movies and the speakers give off phenomonal sound . You wo n't find a better bargain than these for under $ 100 .

High quality cable ! Bought it to use in-wall between two panels . This cable works well with good shielding , is very flexible -LRB- better than the coaxial cable I was thinking of using -RRB- easily fitting through some pretty tight turns , and has well made connectors that wo n't slip off and seem pretty sturdy . I purchased this for the length , the fact that I do n't want to put anything in the wall I will have to replace soon and the reasonable price . 	Subwoofer

This system was easy to set up . The matrix system allows 5.1 surround effect for regular mp3 file which it sounds absolutely amazing . Try listen to Celtic Woman - Ave Maria . Feels like you are in heaven with angels singing around you . Also , the system works great with games like Crysis and Bioshock . It immerse you with the sound of screaming splicers and the explosion of grenade launchers . And you gotta love the price . No matter what you say , 5.1 surround sound system with the price of $ 80 -LRB- plus shipping & handling -RRB- for a college student like me is the best price there is . I have to thank Logetic for making such affordable and amazing 5.1 surround sound system available . 	Subwoofer
This cable not only does what it needs to , but it looks great doing so ! The quality for such a simple cable surprised me , the way it is made to connect to the inputs makes it really GRIP the connection , which was really impressive and helpful . It is nice to see some cables for a price like this , having worked at a major yellow tag retailer , I know that the markups on cables can be INSANE ! It is nice to get a quality product like this without paying threw the nose for it ! 	Subwoofer
I should preface this review by saying that I 've worked as a salesman for such speakers as B&W , Sunfire , and Klipsch , so I know what good speakers sound like . Having said that I still love these speakers . Are they super high quality ? No. . Do they distort ? Yes . Would I recommend them for serious listening connected with some Audioquest cables ? Of course not . But , when you want to have a 5.1 system for your computer and do n't want to spend a bundle , these are hard to beat . They deliver good sound with music and movies . They come with speaker cables that are long enough for my relatively small room . All the plugs are color coded for those who are technology shy when it comes to hooking things up . And the wired control has a handy headphone jack -LRB- which I must note disables the volume control on the remote . You will have to control your volume using a software control ; I use the wheel on my mouse , and it works out fine -RRB- . UPDATE : I must say that having owned these speakers for some time now that they are pretty disappointing . I still stand by my original bang-for-your-buck opinion but you would really be well served to find some better quality speakers for your computer . But if you only have a little bit of dough this set could be your answer . 	Subwoofer
Este cable es excelente , en mi Home Theater tenia conectado el subwoofer con el cable que trae de fabrica , al cambiarlo por este cable Belkin la diferencia en el sonido se not&oacute; inmediatamente , los sonidos graves son mucho mas definidos y profundos , la diferencia en el sonido es enorme , por el precio es una compra obligada , si no quieres gastarte una gran suma de dinero en un cable en un cable sobre-valorado gracias a el gran marketing que tienen , Belkin llenara tus expectativas con creces y a un gran precio .

I bought this here for $ 100 less than BestBuy wanted for it . Installation was extremely simple . All you have to buy is wire for the power and ground . You do n't even have to run a remote-on wire if you splice it with the speaker wires . I have a Yaris Hatchback and it sounds amazing in there . The output on this thing is far more than I expected . I am very please with my purchase : -RRB- 	Subwoofer
Tried this out on multiple receivers , as well as using multiple inputs : RCA , Optical -LRB- CD , Phono , Computer -RRB- . Sub gets marks for being great filler , but if you are looking for any type of bass hit this will leaving you wanting three , maybe four more of these subs . Will be returning sadly . 	Subwoofer
I purchased this subwoofer to add bass to a pair of bookshelf speakers . It was very easy to match the subwoofer to the bookshelf speakers using the adjustable crossover control . The auto on\/off function is a real convenience . Overall , this was a perfect addition to my stereo system . The bass is extremely tight and the 300-watt amp provides ample power . It 's great for music -LRB- jazz , rock and classical -RRB- and for watching videos . If you want a subwoofer that will rattle your windows , then you should look for 12 '' subwoofer . But if you 're looking for accurate and distortion-free bass at a `` reasonable '' sound volume , then this might be the one for you . 	Subwoofer
This subwoofer is more than incredible for its price . If you need\/want a sub and are on a budget get this before they 're all gone . This beast can fill my three-person dorm with chest-shattering bass . If you 're an audiophile you will probably find faults ; however , for an average -LRB- perhaps even above average -RRB- listener this will be MORE than adequate . I am a fan of Techno , Hip-Hop , Pop , and Reggae and each genre sounds fantastic with it . It has no trouble crushing you with the low bass hits from across the room . Oh , I forgot to mention that it makes movies absolutely incredible ! -LRB- Try Inception , I was blown away with the PSW505 's performance with it . -RRB- Best song I have found to test it so far : Girls on the Dance Floor , Far East Movement -LRB- Even if you do n't like pop , give the first 15 seconds a chance with the volume at 3\/4 -RRB- -LRB- ... -RRB- 	Subwoofer
The perfect subwoofer for my space . Compact enough to fit the room with big sound for a great home theater experience . All at a very reasonable price . Bass output is smooth and well balanced . Setup is a snap as the output level and crossover is easily adjustable . I did n't recall reading that the PSW10 was not magnetically shielded before I bought it . Hard to imagine in this day that it was not , however , as I have an LCD TV , it was not a problem for me . Also the black cabinet finish blends well with my other speakers , equipment and cabinetry . I am very satisfied and if given a choice would buy it again . 	Subwoofer
In my opinion , you can get a good home theater sub in the $ 150 and up range . I was n't trying to spend that much and just needed a sub for now . Even though I knew that I was n't spending a lot of money , I still wanted a quality product and expected this product to sound good . I was skeptical of the 50 watts and what kind of performance it would have . When I received my sub via UPS , the box was light and I was worried . What I lifted out of the box was even more discerning because it was small ! Also , the speaker grill ca n't be taken off , Yamaha does n't want you to see the actual woofer like those worthless 3 piece desktop c.d. radios at Kmart ! A clear sign of , cheap ! Well , what was I to do besides plug and play ? I teamed this sub up with a classic pair of Bose series III 301 's , a worth while set of speakers if you did n't pay the retail price . I have to say I am honestly surprised by the clean bass that the Yamaha sub system creates . To my surprise , this is not a one note thumper ! I listen to Hip-Hop , R&B , Jazz , Latin , Chicago House and the sub compliments everything with a few volume adjustments between c.d. 's . Movies are a real blast to say the least ... I 've read reviews that talk about the 45 degree angle placement . I actually placed the sub in the least favored position according to Yamaha 's owners manual by placing the sub parallel to the front wall with the driver facing the listener and the sound is honestly amazing ! It gives your current speakers that needed boost , with the ability to thrust the listener deeper into the music by producing a songs detailed bottom end . I am happy with the added depth that this sub brings to my music and movies ! I just sold my Bose Acoustimass surround system just for a change , because there are in fact other options that can better fit my sound requirements . This Yamaha sub blows Bose 's fraud of a `` bass module '' out of the water hands down ! At last bass is actually present when I watch a movie ! I really enjoy this sub . You wo n't be disappointed if you buy it ! And if you have a much bigger budget when shopping for a powered sub , give this a try and you could possibly save the rest of your money ! 	Subwoofer
One of the best bang-for-buck subwoofers on the market . Good tight bass , solid build and quality craftsmanship make this deal an easy purchase . I have 2 and recommend it for small to medium home theaters with no hesitation ... 	Subwoofer
This cable is too hard , and I will not buy again . I normally do not write the review , but this cable seems no good at all . I 'm not sure the audio quality because it is only 4ft long . 	Subwoofer
I bought this sub a couple of months ago through amazon in addition to the Quintet speaker system . Could n't be happier with the power coming from this subwoofer . With the sub set to -15 db on my receiver , the floor and windows still tremble whenever watching a movie or listening to music . I have yet to really turn the subwoofer to full capacity for fear my neighbors would get upset . Bottomline , this subwoofer is powerful and has the capacity to deliver enormous levels of base . Incredibly glad I decided to go with the 12 '' Synergy over the SW-350 , this is the best subwoofer out there on the market for the price . Whether the purpose is for subtle support for your listening pleasure or a complete dimension of full bass experience , this subwoofer delivers through the entire range on the spectrum . 	Subwoofer
I bought this product for my Macbook laptop . It arrived on time and was extremely easy to set up and use . The sound quality is excellent and I am very satisfied with the purchase . 	Subwoofer

Okay , I 'm not gonna give a 6 page review on this things so i 'll keep it short and to the point . This sub arrived as scheduled . Initially , I was very excited to hook this sub up . The sub is only 150 RMS and 300 watt max but since it is a Kicker product , my expectations were high . I read tons of reviews saying how this is `` the best subwoofer for the price . . period '' and `` Kicks so hard for the wattage '' . Well , maybe . I 'm currently running an 800 watt Visonik Bridgable amp . I will tell you this , this kicker can hit hard , but can not preform good low bass notes and deep bass . Its really not loud at all . I purchased it thinking it would atleast shake my small car a little -LRB- i have a 1993 Chrysler Lebaron -RRB- and it hardly does anything . Now i 'm not expecting these to be Kicker l7 material or bust my windows out ... But Its dissapointing for a kicker product . I 'm asking that you take my word for it because a few reasons . I 'm not an amateur nooby car audio kid . I 've had a few speakers in my day and i know how to set systems up pretty well . I 'm just saying right now , PLEASE LISTEN . If you are looking for your first subwoofer for a small car , then go ahead and by one . Hell maybe two . But if you were like me looking for the short way out of some cheap 12 inch kickers to rattle your car , save yourself the money and purchase a better model or different brand . This kicker ca n't really even keep up with a cheap Sony XPLOD from walmart -LRB- which you would be paying about the same amount -RRB- My 12 inch 80 dollar Sony XPLOD from walmart rails way harder than this . Please do n't take everyone elses word over mine . They are probably amateur car audio kids with their first system and do n't really know what `` bumping '' is . 	Subwoofer
I moved my speakers around , so needed a longer subwoofer cable after reading the reviews i decided to go with this . This works fine . 	Subwoofer
The sophisticated BoomBUDDY speaker is really nice , other than being cool because of its shape , it works really well and sounds loud considering is not a huge stereo . 	Subwoofer
I purchased this since my energy subwoofer had a 8 inch speaker and was good down to 35 hz . My energy cf70 were good down to 37 hz so the subwoofer was no longer giving the awsome deep affect that it once was . Replaced it with this psw505 with a 12 inch woofer and it blended perfectly and sounded extremely nice on music and with movies . I would highly advise anyone needing a sub . and has room for it . Do n't buy small and upgrade later . Catch this one on sale when it hits 199 and you are good to go with out future spending . Great value great sound . 	Subwoofer
There are better subs but none better in this price range . I use the FSW100 with the Yamaha YSP-1100 and it provides just enough bass . It will not provide the bone crushing bass needed for hard core rap fans or for the head banger types . Then again , that 's not my usage . Viewing Blu-ray movies and day to day TV , you can not go wrong with this sub . 	Subwoofer
This is an excellent piece for adding bass to your car . I searched for about 2 months , went to all the car-electronic parts shops , and even to the Honda dealer . Everytime I was shown Big subwofers , and bigger amps , It was so difficult for me to explain to those guys , that I was not the one who was trying to rattle me neighbor 's windows , or even who wants lady gaga , to `` ga ga '' with full throttle . I listen to all kind of music , including classical . My only requirement was that I should have a thing which can just make all the highs and the lows sound as they should . I bought the infinity , and it really makes the Car-Radio sound 100 times better . I have a Honda Civic 2008 LX with std radio , and this thing has really made the difference . I am going for speaker upgrade next month as I have already bought them -LRB- will power them with a P4004 4 channel amp -RRB- , if I would n't have , I think the basslink , does exactly what the name says , links bass to your car radio . I would rate it a 10\/10 for the money they are charging -LRB- as you do n't need to pay for an amp , and neither an enclosure -RRB- . If you are not fond of your adjacent driver knowing what you are playing , and just listen the music for it 's sake , and for your own pleasure . I would highly recommend the Basslink 	Subwoofer
I use the BIC V-80 in my home office and am very satisfied with it for music and movies . The bass is tight and well defined . I use this sub with a pair of Polk Audio Monitor 30 bookshelf speakers sitting on my desktop . A great combination . I have owned this sub for close to a year now with no problems . It is well made . My only complaint was when I was using the sub with an integrated amp that had no subwoofer output . The BIC only has speaker level inputs , not outputs . You have to connect the sub and your speakers to the same speaker connections on your amp . This can create a 4 ohm load on the amp . I now have a Harman Kardon HK3390 with a sub output . 	Subwoofer
loved the sound . . while it was there . Like others , about a year after purchase it died ... Not even a response from Infinity . . Always thought they had a good name . Go elsewhere folks . 	Subwoofer
I purchased mine for a little less then $ 60 dollars and I am very pleased . I was n't expecting much for the price but it turned out to be very good . Satellite Speaker are built well , they do n't feel like cheapos and the wires are long enough for me and I have it set up in my room\/garage . If you plan to set this up as Home Surround sound system , then , yea they will be too short to place at preferred location . The Subwoofer is small and it turns out decent bass . The wires for the bass box to computer are short , so plan on having it near by . I personally enjoy having the bass knob on the remote control many audio systems have it set in the back or the subwoofer box making adjusting it a pain . I have had this Sound System for over a year and overall I am pleased with my purchase . 	Subwoofer
I bought this sub based largely on reviews I have read online -LRB- Amazon included -RRB- . I listened to one in a home theater store and it came down do a Velodyne model and this Polk one . It arrives , I set it up , and let it go . Do n't get me wrong , I know I had set it up properly and never `` stretched '' the sub to its maximum capabilities . It sounded great in virtually all areas I used it for . However , 3-4 months into its use I begin to hear the unmistakable death rattle from the box and it quickly gives out . Thankfully , I purchased the warranty and a new one is on its way . I am not yet ready to give up on this purchase . For now , the rating will be what it is but may change after the arrival of the replacement . 	Subwoofer
I bought this sub for my husband , because I was sick and tired of the huge black box that sat next to our couch . It was an eyesore . I own some of the Cambridge computer speakers and was really impressed with their sound for the money , so I gave this a try . Now we both have what we want . My husband gets a great sounding subwoofer that shakes our walls during fly by scenes of Top Gun , and I get a good looking sub that does n't make our living room look like am electronics yard sale . My husband especially loves the remote on the subwoofer . Great idea - and adds a cool factor that he shows off to his buddies . 	Subwoofer
I got on sale when was $ 199 here . For that it adds just enough bass and stereo to get the job done if you do not have room or inclination for full stereo . We put this upstairs-my full 1000 watt system is downstairs . Note for those using Harmony Universal Remotes-switch the default power on delay for the soundbar from 1500 to 5000 . Otherwise the Harmony will send commands before it is fully on . 	Subwoofer
In cabling , usually shorter is better , and this 8 ft. is just the right length for a subwoofer that sits next to the media center . It replaces a much longer cable for me , and I noticed an improvement in the bass immediately . Its connectors fit snugly , it is beefy and seems like an all around good buy . 	Subwoofer
I had previously purchased a different power subwoofer from Amazon and I was totally disappointed . Okay , it sucked ! I returned it . Thanks Amazon ! Anyway I had very low expectations for this woofer before I received it . I was hoping to just add a little bass to my music . After I hooked it up I was amazed ! It actually hits hard . It has a good range of bass . If you want just a little thump for movies or a wall-shaking boom this is the ticket . I have tried several and I 'm very pleased with this one . I have limited space and this fit into it perfectly . 	Subwoofer
This is an absolute bang for your buck at this $ 220 price point . The bass is thunderous to say the least . Highly recommended ! 	Subwoofer
These newer amp 'd tubes are a neat design in that they are compact , easy to install\/uninstall and are well matched in regards to the sub and amp . I first just had this one sub and it was nice sounding . I then added the BT6014 and output literally doubled . It sounded great but just not very loud . The play a nice range of bass frequency . If looking to just add some filler bass and not shake up the neighborhood then these do nice . The perfect application for these are a single cab truck . The cool thing is they are light and easy to uninstall\/install with just two connectors . Unplug them and unstrap the tube and you have your space again . 	Subwoofer

"I own a <ahref=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0002KVQBA/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/184-5792514-5417157""> Polk Audio PSW10 10-Inch Monitor Series Powered Subwoofer -LRB- Single , Black -RRB- </a> , which for some reason has left - and right-channel RCA inputs , while my <ahref=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001U74DAA/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/184-5792514-5417157""> Pioneer VSX-819H-K 5-Channel A\/V Receiver -LRB- Black -RRB- </a> has a mono output for the LFE channel . After buying the sub , I could picture the mono male to stereo male RCA cable that I needed , but none of the blue-shirted associates from a certain nameless Big Box store knew what I meant . I finally got the cable from `` AdioShackRay '' , and got good sound quality until I did further research . I read that a regular one-channel RCA interconnect would suffice , since the sub is a mono speaker . Also intending to move my sub to a new location , I searched Amazon as a new `` Prime '' member for a highly rated , brand name subwoofer cable that was around 15 feet . I found exactly what I was looking for with this cable . THX Certification was a bonus . I might be crazy , but I think I did notice a newfound crispness to the sound . The connection is firm on both ends . Nice and tight . I did not notice any `` stiffness '' of the cable . Nothing out of the ordinary , or noteworthy . Just a regular cable . Granted it 's double-shielded or whatever , but it 's not a steel rod . Two-day shipping was spot on . The box was even wrapped in plastic , presumably to preserve it if left outside during the rain . Great job Amazon ! Opening the product was also very simple . Monster 's packaging was perforated . I did n't have to fight against the typically impenetrable plastic casement . Definitely well-thought out . Hopefully , with Amazon 's help , I can afford to buy Monster again . "	Subwoofer
I was looking for a sub to add to my home-theater and home-audio setup without spending too much . I appreciate quality audio , but I 'm also fine with getting along with inexpensive gear as long as it sounds good enough . This sub definitely falls into that category . As with any speakers , and especially subwoofers , placement is key . Low-frequency sound radiates with a pattern that is much closer to `` in every direction '' than the higher-frequency sound that your main speakers produce . That means that the optimal place for this sub is probably not pointed straight at you . The room that you place it in will have a large impact on how loud it is , and \* where \* it is loud . For starters , try placing the sub in a corner . If you can not place it in a corner , place it against a wall . If aesthetics allow , experiment with pointing the driver towards the wall , or into a corner ... depending on the room and what objects are in it , this can amplify the bass . Also , do n't forget the phase switch . After you have found your sub placement , have someone help you out by switching the phase between 0 \* and 180 \* while you sit in the main listening area . One of the settings will be louder ! This unit has only a single drawback -LRB- that I 've found so far -RRB- : it has no true `` off '' setting ; you have to unplug it to get that effect . The `` auto-power-on '' mode is a little liberal for my taste ... for some reason , it is almost always on . If you are concerned with energy consumption , you should be aware of this . The sub does n't draw that much power even when turned up loud , though -- maybe 10-15 Watts from the wall -LRB- 1 second averaged -- instantaneous peak draw is likely much higher , but I do n't have a meter fast enough to report that -RRB- .

I bought these speakers for use on my 24 '' Sony LCD flat screen . I have been using the Logitech Z 2300 system on my computer and since I was so pleased with it , I decided to try the Z-4 's on my Sony . As it turns out , the speakers are essentially an exact match to the television set . I have used the ` snap on ' type velcro to attach them to the side of the screen . The screen has a silver band around it that , like I said , is close to a perfect match to my little add-ons on the side . The sound quality improvement , needless to say is a tremendous improvement to the TV itself . Even though this is my smaller upstairs set , we watch it quite a bit more than the large 50 ' downstairs . Now that we have the sound to match the picture , about the only thing lacking is the 24 vs. the 50 . Logitech makes great products and the Z-4 is no exception . I might mention that I have made little grills to cover the fronts of the side speakers as I did n't want the grandkids to do the little ` pokey ' thing . I used thin fiberglass non-copper clad covered with black cloth . Those turned out great also . Great product ! 	Subwoofer
i bought these subs for my 2005 chevy trailblazer since i was redoing the system , i bought 2 of them and i thought the would be bad for the price but The are awesome !!!!! i bought 2 amps one for each one and a pioneer avhp-4300 indash dvd for it . the subs hit better then my audiobahn aw1206ts , i have to turn the subs down to hear the music , but when summer breaks ur going to hear me coming !

Recently pulled the trigger and bought two of these babies from Amazon for my new home theater based on all the extremely positive reviews on Amazon ! Let me tell you , I am thrilled with the performance of this sub , especially at this price ! These subs replaced one Polk PSW12 , which in its own right , was a very good sub , but had its limitations and I hated the port noise chuffing that was audible on demanding sub frequency passages ! The PSW505 sub is 5 levels above the old 12 . Deep , powerful , crisp , clean and most importantly little or no port noise that can be heard ! Put on any super sounding Blu-ray you have in DTS , try U-571 for sub-bass , especially the underwater bombing sequence , holy cow shake rattle and roll -LRB- your teeth that is ! -RRB- One recommendation , beef up your acoustic treatment in your theaters\/listening rooms with some thick corner or front\/back wall bass traps , it will make world of a difference in the quality of your sound , especially sub-bass ! Highly recommended product and in my humble opinion the biggest and best bang for the buck out in there in the audio video universe ! Bravo POLK AUDIO and Amazon for the sweet deal ! 	Subwoofer
A nice large powered sub-woofer . This unit fit in nicely with my Onkyo 705 AV receiver . Good deep bass . You will have to buy a y connector -LRB- 5.00 at Radio shack -RRB- if you 're using a toslink cable , it only has the red and white connectors on the back . 	Subwoofer

I was a little cautious buying a 25 foot cable , but the price was just too good to pass up . I have used it with two different subs and the sound was great on both . I have had this cable for almost two years and I am sure I will use it for a few more . Great value . 	Subwoofer

"These subs are probably the best value on the market period . The low price does not reflect the quality of this speaker at all . These do not just make your car rattle , it actually improves the quality of the music you listen to . I paired this with a Kicker 400.1 amp and I think it is the perfect match to two of these subs . The amp supports a 2 ohm load so thats how I wired them . The enclosure I put them in was the <ahref=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0013MYXDO/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/186-1070704-0966658""> Atrend E12Dsv B Box Series 12-Inch Dual Vented Enclosure with Shared Chamber </a> .

So I just got these in the mail today and took them out of the package and was almost really mad -- they are so small ! I thought there could be no way that these little things would be worth the $ 100 I just paid for them . But then once I hooked them up I was astonished ! The quality and sound of them is fantastic and blows the $ 100 Altec Lansing set I had before . I quickly tried all sorts of music , from bass-heavy techno to screaming guitar metal and found that they remained quite crisp and clear for both , with heavy bass and full sound . Honestly , as they sit here on my desk the sound just fills the room and I do n't know how the little things do it . Seriously , they are just three little cool looking things and somehow they are filling this whole room with sound . Now of course its not a high end system and I 've seen things more powerful but for such a compact , cool looking , $ 100 system , I 'd definitely say this is top notch . 	Subwoofer

Arrived Wed , 11\/30\/11 after buying on Black Friday . Came with everything , was easy to install the base and set up . The picture is among the best I 've seen . Nice bright colors , viewing angles are fine . It replaced a much older 32 '' Westinghouse LCD which was about 3 times heavier , this thing is light . No dead pixels . Another reviewer said their picture was n't great , must have gotten a bum unit . Mine is uniform from edge to edge , colors are sharp everywhere . The internal speakers however , and is a common theme among cheap TVs I guess , is n't so great . Sounds like its playing in a bathroom . If you are n't hooking it up to an AV system try this : take an old pair of computer speakers and plug it into the headphone jack . The TVs volume will still control them and the sound is 10-fold better . I used a pair of about 15yr old Altec Lansings , which will be fine until I get an AV system . Only messed up thing with this is the TVs internal speakers are still on , they should turn off when you plug in speakers to the headphone jack . I cant find anywhere to turn them off , if anyone knows please let me know how . Remote code 0305 worked to program my TiVo remote for the TV . 	TV
Within 10 minutes of opening the box , I was on the couch watching 1080p video via HDMI streamed off my home network SMB share . The user interface is not shabby at all , but could use a slight amount of polish ; it 's like they copied about 75 % of the Apple TV interface and called it a day . The unit can fast forward and rewind during playback without issue , but the navigation to get to the various media files is a little clunky , and overall less efficient than it could be . For around $ 100 , the unit plays hi-def video files of pretty much any format flawlessly , and helpfully remembers where you paused\/stopped if you get interrupted . Bottom line : If you have an 100-base T Ethernet jack available anywhere near your HDTV , you should pick one of these up . 	TV

This antenna is grossly overrated by many . I though my old one is bad , as it can not get all the channels without adjusting . But this piece of junk can not get some channels even I tried hard . 	TV
Tried hard to get this antenna to work as well as my old antenna , but still lost one channel with tower 26.5 miles away , and another station with tower 38.5 miles away . Mounted LAVA 22 feet above ground , and I live in FL which is hill-less . Support was adequate and responsive , but everything we tried did n't help . In addition , the antenna rotated the first 3 or 4 times I tried it and then abruptly stopped -LRB- even though the little red light on the bottom of the device was still lit -RRB- . Had to put my boy with a walkie-talkie on the roof to tweek the direction the device was pointed , but still could n't get those two stations that we used to get . Unless you are replacing a set of rabbit ears , save your money . I plan to remount my old beat up 27 year old VHF tv antenna . 	TV
I purchased this TV and am extremely happy with the Picture and refresh rate of images . ultra thin TV design doesnt allow for much in the way of built in speakers .

My husband purchased this particular television in October 2005 . We 've never had any problems with it , and it continues to function beautifully . One thing I 'm confused about : description indicates it has an HDTV monitor , yet I 've been told it 's not actually an HD television . I do n't see a difference in quality of picture when watching a regular movie channel or the same channel on an HD channel , though picture quality is very good . Am I missing something ? Picture quality on other televisions that are HD capable seem to be far more crisp . Also , I 'm wondering since this set is 5 years old , will it function with a BluRay system , in terms of delivering that quality of picture ? Thank you . On a scale of 1-5 , with 5 being excellent , I give this television 4.5 . It 's proven to be a good investment . 	TV
I have 2 of this model and purchased 2 of the more recent model Although the recent model is good if you can find this model it must have a better lens because the detail is more acurate . The range of the newer ip200 series and N capapble is better and I use this one for the 120 ft run to the wireless router the image at any distance is not as good as the ip100w n The economics and the ease of setup of this inside camera are the best .

When you play FPS games like Resident Evil 5 you can see yellow ghosting when you move the camera left and right . You can see it really clearly when you move a white object against a black background really fast or vise versa . When I connect a PC to it and move a white cursor against a black background I can see yellow trailing of the cursor ; I bet you all humans can see it on this TV . This yellow trailing is more annoying than the motion blur trailing on a LCD\/LED . The only plasma TV I heard that does not do this is the 3D Panasonic VT20\/VT25 because the red and green phosphors lose light at a 65 % faster rate . If this TV did not have this problem then I would give it 5 stars because these green phosphors lags strain my eyes . I heard that the TV must be run for at least 100 hours to minimize this green sub-pixel lag . I will update my review later if the yellow trailing goes away in the future . The good things I can say about this plasma TV is it has excellent viewing angles , sound quality , black level performance , glare prevention , brightness , and color accuracy . 	TV

Once again I bought this small TV for whenever I lose electrical power . The storm last month left us without power for over 21\/2 days . 	TV
I think this a great buy at $ 100.00 , but without an upgrade to Honeycomb or a newer OS it still leaves much to be desired . I bought it to get in on the great price and wait for the upgrade . We love it to watch Youtube , HBOgo , and check fantasy scores during games and it does all those things great . The upgrade is needed for sites running the new version of flash -LRB- i.e. Espn3\/Watch Espn -RRB- . Overall , great product and ca n't wait to see what the new upgrade offers . 	TV
Got this with the free glasses and blu ray for 1539 . Fr the price this tv is amazing , picture is as good as any of the more expensive sets I tested , and the free kit and blu ray is just a great bargain . First off , I noticed no buzzing or any of the old spanish soap opera complaints I read from earlier reviews . The picture is just perfect . The black levels and clarity were even better than I thought they 'd be . Add in internet apps and you have one amazing tv . The piture in 1080p is nothing short of perfect . I only tried the imax triple feature in 3d , but in blew me and my freinds away . The picture quality is just as good as when in 2d , and it really jumps out at you , and adds incredible depth to the picture . I really ca n't wat for more 3d movies to come out , becuase the effect is just something else . The only prolem I ran into was the glases someties picking up light and freaking out on me , distorting theveiw through the lenses , but it only happened a couple times , and I had the lights on while I watched . All in all , I love the set , and am extremely happy with my purchase . 	TV
I bought one of these at another store at a great price -LRB- a returned item -RRB- and have been really impressed so far . It has a much sharper and brighter picture that seems a lot more realistic than the 20 '' Vizio that broke down and was replaced by this Coby . The only minor complaints that I have are that the audio out jack is located in the middle of the back instead of at the side and that it only has one HDMI connector . For the money , this is a terrific TV ! 	TV
I purchased my Philips 42PF9630A in June of 2006 from Circuit City for $ 1799.00 . Within the first week the sound would go off all by itself and I would have to turn the set off and back on to get the sound to work . I called Circuit City and they said they would have a repairman get in touch with me . After 6 months of calling for a repairman , one finally called and said he had never worked on this set before but he would pick it up the next week . He never showed and finally in January 2007 after many phone calls , Philips gave me authorization to have the set replaced . Of course this set is no longer being sold at Circuit City . Circuit City was great , they gave me a set 42PF9631D-37 that was selling at the same price as my old one , $ 1799.00 plus they threw in a Bose CineMate sound system and a 5 year warranty to boot !! The new set is awesome however it has started to have little flashes of blue light on one side of the screen every now and then . Good thing they threw in the warranty !! Would I purchase another Philips TV ... Yes , they may have problems but for the price , cabinet design and especially for the Ambient lights , you ca n't beat them . . 	TV
this is a very nice tv dont be fooled at the $ 200 price point no need to go spend $ 300 on a lg or a vizio or something this tv is just as good got my ps3 hooked up to it with component cables getting hdmi in the mail next few days and i imagine will look even better maby the only downside is the sometime jerky movement in high speed games uc3 beta cod black ops but this is no big deal and u will get used to it within a few days overall good tv nice colors picture look good buy !

I purchased this unit to use in our travel trailer mainly for its small size and flat screen . It fits very tight , but serves it 's purpose well since the flat screen makes it viewable from different angles , and with 6 people watching at once , thats important to us . The screen is clear and bright , best color and picture I have seen among all the top brands . Had it for 4 months - no problems . 	TV
I was hunting for months for such a solution and a friend recommended this one for me . My biggest challenge was sharing downloaded videos between smart TV 's , playstations etc around the house . I use the WD TV Live hub in the living room connected to my LCD and also use it to stream directly to smart TV 's connected to my LAN around the house , i tried several PC based media servers that seemed unreliable , i recommend that you always use a wired ethernet connection to this device and whatever you are streaming to . Likes Great user interface Ability to connect an external USB drive if you use up all the 1TB of internal space . Regular software updates . no crashes to date . Can access it as a shared network drive from any PC , means you dont have to connect your computer to it to upload , copy , move or delete files . Streams great to my Sony bravia TV . Plays any video format i have thrown at it so far . Dislikes none so far 	TV
"We purchased this TV for my 2 and a half year old , she likes all Dora and Barney and the rest of the gang , and the living room TV was taking a toll on our news time , the Coby LED was the definite answer , she plays her DVD 's there she call us to dande in front of it , she is so independent and this set confirmed so , I recomend this set to anyone who wants great image\/sound . Great second set . <ahref=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0040XJC7K/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/182-6955985-1129503""> Coby LEDTV2226 22-Inch 1080p HDMI LED TV\/Monitor , Black </a> "	TV
Let me say that this TV is great for the price - especially if a 3D bundle is included . However , if you do receive a defective TV , like I have - you will not get much help from Toshiba . Their tech support , who are pretty much robots sticking to a script and reading from the manual , wo n't offer much assistance . I currently am waiting for a replacement because my TV 's 3D would not sync with the 3D glasses unless you were within 4 feet of the TV . My IR sensor was clean and had a clear line of sight , but still would lose its sync once you moved back beyond 4 ft. . If anyone else experienced this , please let me know . Besides that , the TV is great and Amazons customer support is top notch . And as for the clouding , it is there - but only when there is no signal . Hopefully my next one will work and I can start enjoying it . UPDATE 5\/26 : Had to send my TV back - but I helped a friend set up his . It worked fine but there is clouding like there was on mine . Again , if there is no signal you 'll get clouding , but it goes away with a picture . 	TV
Even for 99 bucks and having the new Android 3.1 , this product leaves MUCH to be desired . Sure , I can surf and search the web from my TV and look through mountains of useless bad youtube videos and run half-baked buggy Apps . But , there 's no Hulu and no good media player software on this thing which should have been included by default . PROS : -- One of the only saving graces of this product is that it has Netflix , but who does n't these days . I can get a cheap roku or blu-ray player if that 's all I wanted . I expected more from Google . -- I heard Skype is planning on releasing their software for Google TV , so I can make video calls with it . Fingers crossed as I waive past my return period hoping I do n't get shafted by another false promise . -- I read that Boxee is planning on porting over their media player software to Google TV . The other half dozen media player solutions being offered on the android marketplace are all half-baked and horrid ; even PLEX . Almost all of them require a DLNA server to be running which is so 2002 . Any player worth its salt should be able to stream directly from a NAS . No Twonky , no DLAN server , no 2nd computers ... I have been doing this on my XBOX-G1 with XBMC for almost a decade . -- The hope that more Apps will be made which can use this product . Understanding Android 3.1 is still new to these boxes , I will wait patiently since the price was pretty low . CONS : Where do I begin ? -- The HD Camera I also got should include Skype , not some feature lacking Logitech videophone app which does n't talk to any other video phone software . This solution is really half baked . -- Why did n't this device include a coax input connection for my Cable if it 's supposed to interface with my cable TV system ? Why should I need to connect a cable box through a hokey HDMI daisy chain ? The standard Cable TV setop boxes I have seen do n't even have HDMI . -- Did n't we try surfing through the television years ago ? Have n't we learned our lesson ? This is clunky at best . I can get a better surfing experience on my other dozen internet toys like iPods , tablets , smart phones , and my computer . -- Why ca n't I get 5.1 audio through my toslink cable ? This seems to be a common problem on the forums . This looks like a hardware issue and it does n't look like a fix is coming anytime soon since it 's been hanging around since the rollout . -- The remote control , OMG , now there 's an ergonomic mess . I thought it would be smaller from the pictures . At least the Sony solution is not as unwieldy . There are dozens of smaller keyboards like the ones for the BOXEE box , XBOX and Sony game controllers . These smaller sizes have been a proven form factor for years . Why Would Logitech make such a remote control monstrosity ? Does the Sony Google TV remote work on the Logitech Revue ? Anyway , fingers crossed on getting some new apps . . Otherwise , this thing is a brick . 	TV
We purchased this Micca Mplay Digital Media Player and could never get it to work . By the time my husband had time to connect it to the tv and found it did not work it was to later to return to Amazon . Lost that money ... not happy ! 	TV
I tried many others and they brought in ZERO signals . With this antenna I get all of the signals in the air and I am facing the OPPOSITE direction from the transmitters . In my opinion there is no other antenna that works like this model does . NOTE : I use mine on its SIDE facing OUT on top of a narrow 1 foot square box sitting on the window sill against the window or screen NOT horizontally like they show it . Like in Windmill position not helicopter position . VERY IMPORTANT . Do not use Helicopter position . Put in Window sill in Windmill position and rotate like a windmill to tune reception . 	TV
I am so happy and my kids are loving this tv . I was lucky to get 2 free 3D glasses with tv . 3D we onlt tested with xbox game and it was perfect . 	TV
I 've had this TV for about 4 years now . I would give it 0 stars if Amazon would let me !!! The right side of the tv has blue streaks all over it and it is covered in blue dots all over the tv set !!! When I contacted sony about the problem i was told i could purchase the repair kit BUT it would cost anywhere from 700-1000 dollars for someone to install it for me ?? I could not believe it !! The optic block went out on this tv just a few weeks after the warranty ended ! DO NOT buy this product !! There is no point in me getting it fixed when i could buy another 42 in tv for under the 700 dollars it would cost to fix ! I will never buy another sony tv again . Bad company that created a product with problems but refuses to fix them . 	TV
We brought this TV last Thanksgiving for around $ 700 -LRB- normally available around $ 900 - $ 1100 -RRB- , and have been extremely satisfied with its performance . HDTV performance over the air -LRB- OTA -RRB- with an antenna \/ HD convertor box is great . As expected with LCD TVs , the blacks are not great , but the brightness trumps it on the other hand . Connecting the PC was a snap and assembling out of the box was a snap . In addition , all connections are on the side and very intuitive -- a huge improvement from older models . The remote , however , is cheap and remains non-intuitive . Upconverted signal is good , but not good as an equivalent plasma . Overall great value for the price . 	TV
I bought this LCD because of Amazon 's rebate , which made it a great value . I have n't had a chance to play with it much , but there are few caveats you should know : 1 -RRB- Amazon 's site did n't list the rebate -LRB- I found it by Googling the rebate . I 'm not sure why this is , but the $ 300 mail-in rebate was the only reason to buy this , as you can get the Sharp Aquos for the same price without rebate . 2 -RRB- Delivery from Amazon is expensive . Most places do n't charge that much . Amazon for some reason did n't give the delivery company my phone number so they could schedule the delivery . I ended up waiting an extra 5-7 days as Eagle Logistics , the delivery company , ended up sending me a postcard . The tracking information was also not update , so I did n't know that TV had arrived in my city and that they were waiting on me to schedule the delivery . Be wary and make sure you followup with the delivery company . 3 -RRB- The instruction said unpack and haul away . Be careful here . They unpacked TV and took the box . Thus I had no UPC symbol or serial number for the rebate !!!! This is a mistake . they should either cut these out and leave it or Amazon should not send those instructions . I ended up going back to the delivery place headquarters to get the box . 4 -RRB- Olevia has a 6 bad pixel return policy . I have 2 bad pixels in the middle of the screen and they would not replace it . I 'm still waiting the rebate and my HD box , so I 'll post more\/update in a week or so . 	TV
I purchased this box and installed it ... a very easy process and it works well . The one important item that all prospective purchasers of this box must know , concerns the myth that it plays every video format without problems . While it does have a very impressive array of formats that it handles extremely well , within certain formats -LRB- especially WMV and AVI -RRB- there is enough variation allowed in each file 's protocols that prevent all files under these `` umbrellas '' from being played by the box . Specifically , I found that even though the specs state that it plays WMV - close reading of the instructions -LRB- after you have already purchased the box -RRB- state that it ONLY plays WMV 9 files - trying to play ALL other WMV versions will produce a message saying that the format is not recognizable -LRB- and the odds are that your version will probably be WMV 10 or greater -RRB- . This was a significant disappointment . Similarly , it does not handle ALL AVI files - it does many , BUT NOT ALL . The solution I employed was to experiment with transcoding unplayable WMV and AVI files until I found the results which would work - but that is NOT what I intended to do when I purchased this box . Before you commit yourself , I recommend that you visit their forum . You will see many , many users with requests going back more than a year to upgrade the firmware to take care of this - but so far WD has not chosen to do anything about this . Caveat Emptor . Again let me state that this box plays Netflix extremely well , setup was a breeze , it DOES handle many , many file types and , on the balance , I am happy with what it does . This is an addendum after 6 months . Note because of the following I have downgraded this product from 4 to 3 stars . The problem that cropped up with this unit - after the download of the last firmware update which apparently installed without any problems , 2 of my SDHC cards -LRB- which I plug into the USB port at the side -RRB- , corrupted . I conferred with Tech Support who suggested I format the SDHC cards and try them again and if the same problem occurs to revert to a previous firmware version . I 've used these cards many times in this unit over the last few months with no incident . About which files this unit does and does not play -LRB- my prime reason for removing a star -RRB- ... for AVI : it plays AVI encoded using JPEG and DIVX4 AVI but not Cinepak AVI or MS Video AVI . For WMV Files : it does not play WMV1 and WMV2 but it appears from 3 on are OK . For MOV files -LRB- Quicktime -RRB- JPEG are OK , but H263 encodes can not be viewed . OGG are fine , VOB -LRB- DVD files -RRB- are fine as are MKV . But this is definitely NOT the play-all savior that I had hoped it would be . How do you know which encoding system your files are using ? ... there is a really nice freeware app called Media Info which will tell you . 	TV
Kind of ironic when one actually gets excited about a product that does what its supposed to do , eh ? Anyways ... if you 're looking at this type of item you probably already know that : -LRB- A -RRB- Most big screen manufacturer 's recommend cleaning with a soft , dry cloth only . -LRB- B -RRB- A soft , dry cloth does n't always cut it when you have smudges , fingerprints , etc. , or in my case , incidental residue from other common household cleaning products used around - rather than on - my big screen . -LRB- C -RRB- Potentially damaging your big screen merely to clean a few annoying but harmless smudges is NOT a viable option . -LRB- D -RRB- Many or most products that look like they 're safe and potentially effective end up leaving the dreaded `` streak '' marks , which may not end up hurting your screen in the long run but they definitely freak you out a little . Well , after `` testing '' a few different products on my 50 '' Pioneer Kuro Elite plasma , I 'm happy to report I 've found a product that actually works : -RRB- I was n't quite sure what the brush was for when I ordered the product but upon reading the product instructions I realized it was designed to safely remove the excess dust - rather than have it needlessly build up on your cleaning cloth - and in retrospect that 's a pretty neat , and simple , idea . Since it 's a much smaller investment , I first tried the product on my notebook computer LCD screen . Dusted using the brush , applied a few squirts to the included cloth -LRB- which is a little rough , but not too bad -RRB- , wiped down the LCD , and then used the separately ordered microfiber cleaning cloths to polish . Result was an unqualified success ! But ... I never really had streaking problems on the LCD even when I 'd used other products so ... it was on to the big screen . Went through pretty much the same process except on the big screen I tried a small test area initially and when everything looked fine I continued on and did the entire screen . I 'm happy to report no streaks and it also cleaned those previously mentioned residual stray spots from cleaning products used around the big screen as well as minor smudges , etc. . It 's interesting to note that unlike prior products I 've tested , this spray solution does n't even create a `` wet '' look when you 're wiping the screen with the moist cloth and although I once again followed the cleaning with a polish using the microfiber cloths I 'd purchased separately , I 'm not sure it was really even needed as the surface `` dried '' very quickly and there did n't seem to be much residual anything left after the initial wiping ... Bottom line , no issues , no problems , and everything worked as promised . And , while I realize this is a rather lengthy review for a simple and inexpensive product , I suppose its an indication of how pleased I am to finally find a safe and effective solution to my big screen cleaning needs as well as an indication of how fond I am of my zippy cool Pioneer plasma !!

I did n't expect much for a TV priced at $ ... The TV and remote themselves are ugly as sin . The remote has a very cheap feel to it , and the sound quality is n't that good . But then again , this TV gets 181 channels ; has a crisp , clear picture ; is easy to set up ; and comes with lots of features you would n't expect such as sleep timer , A\/V in-out , Timer on-off , and a full function remote control . I do n't know if I have ever spent so little and got so much when purchasing electronic equipment . This is perfect for an extra TV in the kitchen or bedroom . 	TV
I have bought this product for 2004 Christmas . Vertical lines started appear by 2005 Christmas , and the picture is very much distorted . Unfortunately , this happened right after 1 year warranty period . I have called the customer service who told me that it may be the panel problem which may cost $ 1000 -LRB- when new ones are going for starting from $ 850 -RRB- . I will not recommend this product . 	TV
This is superb little television its color quailty and sound clarity are not the best but if you are looking at this TV you are really not trying to look for best you just do n't want the worst right First off this TV has every connection one would need for traditional analog connections this means it supports cable , s-video , multible RCA -LRB- or Stereo -RRB- , and componet it claims to be a flat screen this is true to a point which means the screen that is on the outside is a flat peice of glass or heavy pvc plastic the screen underneath this is curved just as an old crt TV would be but it does have a bennefit of producing a much sharper image that a convex crt TV could not produce because they use this glass trick . This TV does have some sound issues when you use the built in speakers which apear to be attached as a design element but when you have a TV with componet connections to play a good dvd to really get the sound you want it is a must to combine this with a sterero system ether a little desktop 2.1 system or a monster 7.1 blow the walls out stereo system -LRB- note if you going to get stereo system to compliment this the desktops will do just fine if use a big 7.1 you will probelly want a bigger TV -RRB- ! Add all this up and makes a great buy at an exceptional value . 	TV
I followed everything to the letter . It picked up 2 analog stations , but all the digital stations in this city did not scan in . I tried a generic PCI card before this with the same results . But , I bought a DVICO PCI card , and a DVICO USB stick , a Haupaugge DVR -LRB- USB -RRB- and a Silicon Dust net tuner and all picked them up . I learned if you buy a ATSC tuner for under 80 bucks , it wo n't even pick up the channels . If you want an attractive plastic box that DOES do a good job , try a Haupaugge DVR . I am thinking that this box may work , but my city uses a standard that is not `` ATSC 8VSB '' . Or something to that effect . You would think a PC TV Tuner is simple enough that is can be inexpensive and work ! The ones that work for me are hundreds of dollars . 	TV
Love this product -LRB- wife -RRB- . If Mama 's happy everybody 's happy -LRB- husband -RRB- . We both really do like this product but wish it would work with our HD TV . 	TV
Works as described , with good customer support from Ceton should you need it . Network Tuning works well -LRB- though I still want tuner pooling -RRB- . This card does not take up too many resources , and works with a WD green drive . Tip - Have everything setup and prepared as much as possible before the cable card -LRB- or installer -RRB- arrives . 	TV
I have the Sony NSX-32GT1 Google TV and this is the matching blu-ray internet device . I know it sounds silly to have two internet devices , but I mostly bought this to replace my ancient DVD player . I did the Amazon Warehouse deal and it came in perfect condition still wrapped in factory packaging , a major plus . This device was just as easy to set up as my TV and has the same setup . I think it will be convenient for those times I do n't feel like switching inputs and want to watch a movie and Netflix , or even searching the internet . They look great together , too , and the picture on my DVDs is amazing ! So clear and the colors look awesome . The ONLY issue I have is the Keypads and keypad instructions -LRB- or lack thereof -RRB- . I have the exact same Keypad for my TV and I thought that maybe they could be set up on one Keypad , but I was wrong . After I screwed it all up , Sony told me that ONE internet device can only go to it 's OWN remote . . bummer ! I had to label the new remote , which is not a not a big deal , but it seems silly that you ca n't have one remote for matching devices ! 	TV
The goal of this purchase was to separate out my sons gaming consoles - one has a PS2 , the other had a game cube -LRB- shown -RRB- . The unit comes with a vga passthrough cable that allows the computer to `` Pass Through '' without the unit even being on . -LRB- neat trick -RRB- It can allow TV input - although we like to filter that source a little bit more , as parents . From initial delivery to perfect run , took me approximately 20 minutes - because I did not fully understand the audio portion . Please check the instructions when you open the box - it has a neat -LRB- albeit small -RRB- DIAGRAM on one of the inside pages . 	TV
This product works great !!! I have been looking for wireless headphones everywhere and they are just so expensive , I did not want to spend over 60 dollars . I saw this product and the price was perfect . I was worried I would not be able to use on my new LCD television , but it come with all different attachments for the new to older systems . It has a knob on the headset for the volume , which I recommend you keep low and the volume on the TV high to prevent static . We love this product !!! On the weekends my husband is an early riser and he likes to watch his shows on HD with this he is able to do so without disturbing anyone , I can read the paper , or a book sit next to him and not be distracted . I like to watch movies at night and if he has work to do or is sleeping I can watch TV and I have no worries . Highly recommend it . I have had it for one month and we have used it for at least 90 hours and the batteries on the headset are still going strong . 	TV
I purchased this as a bedroom television . While it is satisfactory , I am disappointed that the volume does not go as low as it should and as I would like it to be for bedroom use . The picture is okay -LRB- ony if you 're looking at it straight on , not from the side -RRB- -- the colors -LRB- no matter how many adjustments I 've made -RRB- are not true in comparison to other televisions in my home . It will do , but I will be far more attentive to all these factors next time around . Given the drawbacks , is it worth $ 324 . ? Not at all . 	TV
I purchased this wall mount at a great price on Amazon . The installation was easy which was a huge relief since I had read some people had issues with it and I 'm not that handy . It has held up my 55-inch , 85 lbs Vizio TV for almost a year now , it looks and functions great . Excellent product . 	TV
Picked up one of these on the cheap during a KMart sale after my old Toshiba CRT HDTV died on me . Despite the page saying 720p , the TV can actually go up to 1080p -LRB- it is even listed on the box as being able to -RRB- and it does so beautifully . While the picture is rather impressive for its price , you will soon find why the TV is set as a cheap option once the sound is turned on . The sound is bad ... I mean REALLY bad . It sounds like they tore apart two cheapy cell phones , took out their speakers and put them into the TV . It is terrible sounding ... I suggest picking up some sound system solution like a sound bar to fix the set . Some other issues I came across as well is the placement of the remote sensor . For some reason , it is mounted on the right side of the TV near the power LED , which is very annoying . Instead of aiming right at the TV , you have to aim at the right corner to do anything , and even then the controller messes up . Also , if you have cable or dish , chances are your box top remote wo n't work with the TV . Speaking of which , if anyone can provide me with a working code for a DirecTV RC64 remote for this TV , I will be very grateful as I have tried ALL of the codes provided by them with no working results . All in all , while the picture is pretty nice , this may be a pass for anyone who does n't have a sound solution already or patience to use the remote . 	TV
This HDMI port that connects to the mac laptop to the television is awesome ! It connects to my big screen TV with color restoration . I can use it to watch my Itunes videos that I do n't have on DVD , such as my Family Guy episodes , The Aristocats , and I can even present my slideshows somewhere bigger . 	TV
Only had the unit for 2 days . The picture quality is incredible . Bright , crisp , rich colors and the black is excellent . Setup was a snap , ca n't wait to watch a blue ray movie . 	TV
PLAIN AND SIMPLE . THIS IS WORTH THE 7 DOLLARS . ITS EASY TO PROGRAM AND OPERATES EVERYTHING I WANT IT TO . DEFINITLY HAPPY WITH MY PURCHASE . 	TV
The KV-36HS500 is a joy to watch on a daily basis . If it matches your requirements for a new TV , I do n't think you can go wrong with it . <p> Getting to the point of choosing it was n't easy , though . Here 's why : <p> If you are looking to buy a new TV these days , the vast array of technological choices is overwhelming . CRT , RPTV , FPTV , Plasma , LCD , DLP ... each with their own unique pros and cons that makes them difficult to compare to each other . And these TVs are so expensive that you feel compelled to understand their value to ensure your choice will hold up over time . <p> After spending hours poring over minutiae and managing to scrape the surface of understanding , I had to just decide to decide . So I did . The KV-36HS500 became my new HDTV because it offered the best mix of features and compromises given the rapidly advancing state of television technology . <p> Here is what I learned along the way , in case this helps you make your decision : <p> 0 . Style Unlike the more expensive XBR series , the HS series has a muted matte gray face . The current crop of XBRs has a shiny black border around the screen that I found distracting . <p> 1 . Aspect ratio Widescreen -LRB- 16:9 -RRB- or regular -LRB- 4:3 -RRB- ? That 's one of the major questions these days when choosing a TV . The KV-36HS500 is not widescreen , which means it will show a widescreen program -LRB- usually a DVD movie or HDTV programming -RRB- with bars on the top and bottom . Since most TV content is not yet widescreen , I decided it was preferable to see it at its natural size , and to see the black bars only when watching widescreen DVDs or HDTV . Purists will explain that `` widescreen is the future '' and that most content will be produced in widescreen ... and therefore a widescreen set is the best experience . Well , until that 's true , we 're in the early part of the transition . I will probably be able to afford a widescreen TV by the time most content is produce in 16:9 high definition format . <p> 2 . HDTV HDTV sets look better than non-HDTV sets , even for non-HDTV content . Unless you feed the TV a terrible signal , such as poorly spliced analog cable , the result just looks sharper . Perhaps it 's the TV , perhaps it 's the processing -- my comparisons led me to believe that HDTV had better picture quality in all cases . <p> If you can receive HDTV signals over the air or via DirecTV , apparently the picture is amazing . I have n't seen this yet , but the KV-36HS500 is ready - it has a DVI-HDCP port waiting for the right HDTV set-top box . In the meantime , DVDs look fantastic , even with a DVD player that does n't have Progressive Scan . <p> 3 . Flatness and thinness Most TVs these days have flat screens , and I find the KV-36HS500 's flat screen dramatically reduces glare from ambient lighting . Flat and thin are two different areas though . This TV is not at all `` thin '' like a plasma or LCD . If you want `` thin '' so you can hang your TV on the wall , you need either a plasma or LCD , not a CRT . <p> 4 . Size and weight If you want a lightweight TV you can move yourself , run away ! The KV-36HS500 is 225 lbs , it takes 2-3 strong able-bodied men just to get it into position . On the plus side , no one is ever going to steal it . Plasmas and LCDs are not only thin , they 're light . RPTVs are also light , but they have a limited viewing angle . <p> On this note , make sure to buy this TV from someone who not only has a delivery service , but will happily pick up your return or pick up and deliver an exchange or repair . If you find a problem , you do n't want to be stuck trying to move this TV . <p> 5 . Summary If you watch mostly 4:3 programming -LRB- standard TV -RRB- , enjoy good picture quality , need a fairly large screen , and want to be prepared for HDTV in the next year or two , this TV is for you . If you do n't mind a shiny black border around the screen , you might opt for the 36 '' or 40 '' XBR version of this TV . On the other hand , if you watch mostly widescreen DVDs or HDTV , you should consider a widescreen CRT -LRB- there are very few ! -RRB- or a plasma , both of which will cost more . <p> Best of luck finding your new TV !

Pros : This TV has an excellent picture and sound . It has sufficient connections for satellite , DVD , and VCR . I have one in the bedroom and now find it boring to look at the other TV in the family room . It has a higher volume than the rest of the TV 's in the house . <p> Cons : Instruction booklet is not too great , it specifies how to connect a DVD\/VCR , but not how to connect just a DVD . It turns in to a guessing game since it is not specific . 	TV
I used it with analog signal and it works really well , istalls easily just follow on screen instructions , i totally recommend this item 	TV
Please please heed the advice of the other reviewers and do not sink your money into these worthless cables . The $ 7 alternative works just fine and functions identically !! 	TV
Very well designed with feeling of quality ! Impressive for the money , especially when compared to other mounts from other supplies . 	TV
I am not a dumb man but the total lack of instructional advice that comes with this product is unacceptable , like : What do you do when your picture comes up scrambled no matter what position the dip switches are in . And there is no brand name or web site you can go to . I personally will not consider buying from Amazon again if they allow this type of shady products to be sold under there banner . 	TV
After seven months I 've given up hope of getting the Infini to work on one computer . Tried everything . Charter Cable is on my speed dial , Ceton is on my contacts list , and my ethernt adapter has been crippled . I do believe Ceton tried to help but their product , Ceton InfiniTV4 , has to many issues with my Gigabyte I7 computer . Hard to get to work in the first place , slowly corrupted system , channels begin to get harder to tune , networking became a nightmare , until I had to reinstall Windows -LRB- clean install -RRB- , flash BIOS , and clear CMOS every time the Infini was installed . Tried a replacement card , and then the ethrrnet adapter quit working . I did get the InfiniTV to work on another computer . It 's working fine on that machine . Why it works on one system and not another is for them to figure out . Ceton did work hard to get me up and running . They even managed to have Charter upgrade the firmware on my tuning adapter -LRB- Motorola MTR700 -RRB- from Ver .1.27 to 1.37 . Now the tuning adapter has four tuners -LRB- instead of two -RRB- matching the Ceton . I am watching the Hydroplane races -LRB- live from Tri-Cities , WA -RRB- on a large screen TV in a window and writing this review in another window . I will probably try to send a couple of tuners to the Intel computer . Maybe I have n't given up . The ethernet adapter still does n't work in the Intel machine . Coincidence ? I do n't think so ...

This box is intended to work with older CRT TVs . It essentially turns your TV into a CRT monitor . If you are trying to connect an HDTV to your computer do not use this box , you will not be satisfied with the picture quality . For an HDTV explore other options -LRB- HDMI or DVI -RRB- , s-video and RCA should be last resorts with an HDTV . My box came configured for PAL output , if you require NTSC -LRB- The standard in North America -RRB- the box will not work unless both of the switches are in the down position -LRB- as stated in the included instructions -RRB- . Aside from needing to switch the format to NTSC this worked right out of the box . The picture quality was as expected -LRB- do n't expect to get monitor quality out of your TV , the picture quality limitations are due to the limitations of TVs not this box -RRB- . Making adjustments to the picture was easy . To adjust the picture position use the up , down , left and right buttons with the menu off . Enter the menu to make further adjustments -LRB- picture size , brightness , contrast , etc. -RRB- . As stated in previous reviews , my box does not seem to hold its settings when turned off . If you need to make major adjustments to the picture I recommend purchasing an adapter to plug the USB power cord into the wall . 	TV
I looked around in local stores and found brackets like this for over $ 100 so I checked out Amazon . Glad I did because I got the same bracket for a third of the price ! The install was a breeze had it on the wall and tv mounted in less than a half and hour . Plus the shipping was fast . I received the mount in 4 days . 	TV
followed instructions what little there was of it . The digital box does n't produce a recognizable digital signal . I tried two different connection one through the HDMI amplifier the other directly to the HDMI connection with no success . the component connections from the Wii function when connected to the component inputs of the same TV . no customer support !

I really like the TV . I like the way the picture looks , considering that I spent $ 1500 , and not $ 5000 . I 've had my TV a few days , so I ca n't tell you how it holds up over time -LRB- I 'll be back -RRB- . This review is a `` tell you what you may want to know from day one '' as much as it is a review . I hope I can help prevent you from damaging your projection TV by telling things not mentioned in the manual . <p> An earlier review -LRB- different website -RRB- gave the TV one star out of five because he said after eight months he had side bars permanently burned into his screen , and he felt the manual 's `` do n't use 4:3 mode more than 15 % of the time '' was n't enough information . Keeping this in mind , I never use 4:3 with gray side bars -LRB- I can live with the `` Just '' stretch . -RRB- <p> The manual says nothing about a break in period -LRB- it did n't say `` this TV has new technology and does n't need a `` break-in '' either -RRB- . I 've read several internet articles that recommend special treatment the first 100 hours -- have the contrast turned down . This TV does n't list `` contrast '' but I 'm assuming `` picture '' is the same thing . One said 250 hours -LRB- most said one hundred -RRB- . Everyone said turn down the contrast -LRB- or in our case , I think ` picture ' -RRB- . One said to turn down other things -LRB- well , you need some brightness , or else no light gets to the screen and that ca n't be a good break-in either J. Several articles on projection TVs said `` Wow , after the breakin the picture became really great ! '' My second day I thought it was looking better than the first . One site said `` do n't just turn on your TV for 100 hours and say ` I 'm done ! ' '' , that the turning the TV on and turning it off -LRB- so that the components warm up , then cool down , etc. -RRB- was a part of the conditioning . <p> As delivered , the TV setting was on `` vivid '' which has the highest picture . I turned that all the way down . I hooked a computer LCD monitor up to my DVD player through an S-video , and ran component cables -LRB- red , green , blue -RRB- from the DVD player into the TV so I could compare the pictures . The TV seemed to error on too much red -LRB- people skin color -RRB- , so I changed color temperature to cool , and there was too much color , so I turned down the tint . This gave people a more natural looking skin color . This is n't a criticism of this particular model -- one website named three TV brands and said they all give you a TV with the contrast -LRB- or picture -RRB- turned high and probably too much red . For comic relief , one guy mentioned that the stores put the most expensive TV 's in a category on `` vivid '' so they look better than the less expensive TVs . <p> One site said that the large the projection TV , the more likelihood of problems like burn in . I 'm paranoid about the TV logos in the lower right corner if the logo is solid white -LRB- I sent ABC an email pleading with them to change to something half transparent so the colors underneath come through . -RRB- News channels with a running ticker at the bottom of the screen-never ! <p> Right now while I 'm breaking the TV , I 'm not playing any cartoons . My understanding of the break in is to run the circuitry without a heavy load on the lamps -LRB- like driving your new car 50 miles an hour on the highway -RRB- . To me , the cartoons are very very colorful , equivalent to playing a normal movie on vivid . Would n't that defeat the purpose of the break-in ? I hope to find something about this on the internet . <p> Biggest complaint - I 've already seen with two of my widescreen DVDs that they do n't quite fill the screen from top to bottom -LRB- slight slivers of blackness at top and bottom -RRB- and none of the zoom modes will fix this . Those DVD 's are now banned from the TV -LRB- I 'll play them on my computer -RRB- . One review site said the problem was that this TV only has four Zoom options , and other TVs have more . Maybe later I 'll get a new DVD player that can send out a signal with various zooms and then I would just put the TV on standard aspect -LRB- no zooming -RRB- to accept it . Perhaps this is my biggest complaint against the TV , that the basic `` zoom '' ca n't make it zoom all the way in each direction . From reading the manual , I would have thought it would zoom completely . <p> TV gets 4 of 5 stars for excellent price to performance ratio . I wanted to give 5 , but if all this stuff I found on the internet is true , then when I bought the TV , I could have read the manual , turned it on , and misused\/abused it during the first few weeks of use . I do n't know how much new lamps cost , or what I would pay for the labor . The guy with the problem of the burned in side bars said that one would cost $ 500 total -LRB- parts and labor -RRB- . 	TV
Have you collected videos in a whole bunch of formats -LRB- avi , mkv , etc. -RRB- and want to show them on your super big screen ? Look no further . Just plug in this box and connect an HDMI cable to your TV . Put all your videos -LRB- music and photos , too -RRB- onto any USB storage device -LRB- thumb drive , portable disk , or ebven a monster 2T disk -RRB- and plug it into the WD box . All file structure -LRB- folders , etc. -RRB- is maintained and displayed for easy browsing . Big plus - my wife can use it easily . Suggestion - get a portable 1T disk drive , load it up with movies categorized into folders , and let ` er rip . 	TV
I also ca n't say enough about this tv . . I was in the market for a flat screen HD TV ready 32 '' or higher and looked and did the research and waited and did n't rush . I had gone to the stores and compared pictures and I always went back to this Toshiba , its even got a screen that is pretty close to flat and bought it and I love this set and I saved hundreds of dollars if I went to HD TV ready . Great Picture and value for those looking for a reasonably priced TV with great credentials . It also ConsumerReports # 1 rated 32 '' Conventional tv for the money even listed slightly better than the more than twice as expensive Sony FD trinitron Wega V310 at over $ 900.00 . 	TV
Well I was looking for a good HD player which can play my vedios on my LCD , and what better player can I get than ASUS O Player . The biggest factor I liked in this player and the one which tempt me to buy was its capability to play so many formats including RM and RMVB the one which other players do n't . Performance what should I say ... Buy it watch it ... To name a few formats it can play : Video : MPEG1 , MPEG2 , MPEG4 , VC-1 , H. 264 Video File Extension : TRP , MP4 , MOV , Xvid , AVI , ASF , WMV , MKV , RM , RMVB 720p , FLV , TS , MTS , M2TS , DAT , MPG , VOB , ISO , IFO , M1V , M2V , M4V Audio : MP3 , WAV , AAC , OGG , FLAC , AIFF , Dolby Digital AC3 , Dolby Digital Plus , DTS 2.0 + Digital out , Tag ID3 Image : JPEG , BMP , PNG , GIF , TIFF Subtitle : SRT , SUB , SMI , SSA , TXT What else guys Grab it ... before its too late ... . .

I could not find a remote for the TV I owned and needed the remote to be able to play games on it . I tried to buy what was suppose to be a TV remote made for this TV and it did n't work . Bought this , worked perfectly with no trouble . Do n't waste your money on other remotes , just buy this one , even though it is ugly . 	TV
It works well enough for displaying the computer screen and small and medium sized web videos . When maximizing web videos from Hulu and Youtube to full screen , frame rate drops and it looks jerky . Resize to smaller size and video is smooth again . I have a newer Core 2 Duo laptop with 4GB RAM and Windows 7 64-bit and downloaded the latest drivers and firmware from the -LRB- ... -RRB- for the device . I bought it mostly to watch full screen web videos from Youtube and Hulu , so it will be returned for efund if the is no solution to this . If you are only going to watch videos in windows instead of full screen mode , then it works well . 	TV
After looking at all the local stores I decided to purchase this unit online ... and i 'm glad I did !! I have n't yet explored the HD capabilities yet , but with digital cable ... it looks spectacular !! As some of the other reviews state , the sound can be a little lacking at times , but actually some of the preset eq 's help out a lot ... i would have to say this is one of the best LCD tv 's on the market for the money .

THIS IS A HORRIBLE , HORRIBLE AND AGAIN HORRIBLE TV . ONE OF THE WORST I HAVE EVER COME ACROSS - YEAH , YEAH IT DOES WORK , BUT YOU NEED TUITION TO BE ABLE TO PROGRAM THIS ` THING ' and gawd help you if you press the wrong key ... NOPE - IF I had the strength I would heave it through my penthouse window and drop it solidly 79 floors right into Central Park . WHAT A WASTE OF TIME ... for more pleasure head to Times Square and pick up a hustler ... at least you know what 's in that package and what to expect from it ! SAME APPLIES TO THE ` MAGNIFICENT ' BLUE RAYE PLAYIER IN RECEIVED WITH THIS - ANOTHER MASSIVE MALFUNCTION . 	TV
I purchased this Wall Mount for my new Samsung UN32C4000 32-Inch 720p 60 Hz LED HDTV Flat screen TV . I had one major problem with it . The bolts that came with it did not fit into the holes of the TV . The Holes in the TV were larger . We had to get other bolts and then drill the holes in the wall mount wider to accommodate the wider bolts . I would have just sent it back but , I did n't want the delay of returning it and ordering one that would work for my TV . When I was looking for a mount the Samsung , this one stated it would fit my TV . So buyer beware ! Otherwise it does articulate and functions very well . The down side is when you want to tilt it downward you have to loosen the bolt in the back of the mount , every time you want to move it up or down . The side to side motion can be adjusted to move from side to side from with little effort or you can make it tighter . That adjustment only needs to be set once and it stays that way , until you change it . Having said all that , it is a very secure mounting and holds the weight of the TV and I think it will work well . I would have given it a 5 star if the holes in the mount would have be accurate . 	TV
I upgraded from the WDTV live . This is the same thing for the most part other than it has Netflix . WD should have definitely had wireless built in though . These are great for the price ! 	TV
The picture on this television was very nice . I state that the picture was great but the TV . . not so much . I had 3 different Toshiba 50 '' HDTVs delivered to my house . All three of which had the same damage . The bottom right and left corners of the screen encasement were cracked in half . I gave the rating of 3 because the TV picture I enjoyed , but it is hard to actually enjoy a 1500 dollar television when it is cosmetically flawed everytime it shows up at my door . 	TV
I was eagerly anticipating the arrival of mine which I ordered Jan 17th . It arrived broken so I refused shipment , which was no problem . Then my husband happened to be at Sam 's Club that day , looking at TVs noticed this exact same set on sale there . Boy , was I glad mine arrived broken , because of all the sets on display at Sam 's this 6842PE had the worst picture . BTW - I know Amazon 's prices usually are great , but in this case not so much , the price at -LRB- ... -RRB- was $ -LRB- ... -RRB- . 	TV
This is a very low tech item . It does not take batteries or plug into an outlet . In fact when I saw it was little more than a glorified coat hanger that rests on a stand I became a little paniced , because I was sure I had just wasted my money . However , I was soon pleased to find it did the job and did it well . I now get many more channels than I had before and they are very clear . This item is well worth the money and its as good or better than other amplified antennas you can buy . 	TV
This TV has both a great clear , sharp picture and sound , as well as a lot of features , for a 27 '' stereo TV . <p> The features include its 3-line digital comb filter , dual-tuner picture-in-picture , hyper surround , separate bass and treble adjusters , 3 sets of a\/v inputs -LRB- 2 rear , 1 front -RRB- , 1 rear S-video output , 1 set of a\/v outputs , true hi-fi life-like stereo sound and more . <p> It has a lot packed into it for a very reasonable price . It is one I highly recommend . 	TV
I purchased this television about 3 months ago , and I am very happy with it . The television is loaded with features . The picture is very clear with rich , bright colors . There are several sound options available , such as `` stereo '' , `` sound logic '' -LRB- which keeps the commercials from blaring -RRB- and `` expanded stereo '' -LRB- a feature that simulates surround sound stereo -RRB- . Guide Plus , a free service , is also a nice feature . It allows you to quickly locate channels , as well as read program descriptions and ratings . The TV also has front and rear jacks which is nice if you have alot of equipment to hook up . Programming the TV was a snap thanks to the interactive setup program . I would highly recommend this to anyone looking to purchase a high quaility , feature packed television at a reasonable price . 	TV
I am very satisfied with this product and would recommend it to everyone . I do n't know about everyone else , but I do n't wanna pay a lot of money monthly for cable or be stuck in a 2 year contract just to watch some shows on tv . I 've bought a TV antennae before , hoping I could pick up the local channels . However it was hard to set up and it did n't work at all . I thought I would try out the Philips portable tv . It also included a dvd player which I thought was a good bonus . I love this portable tv ... it 's definitely more than what I expected . I was able to get all the local channels and a few more other channels . The battery life is pretty good . I am very happy I chose this product . 	TV
I bought this mount for a Samsung 43 '' 3D plasma TV that was to be mounted on the wall of my kids ' playroom -LRB- formerly our living room -RRB- . My TV is about 30 lbs and requires a 400x400 mount , according to the Samsung manual . After opening the box , I thought that the mount looked really small and my husband thought that there was no way that it would hold up our TV . In fact , it is really deceptively strong and has no problem holding up the weight of the TV . It came with all the hardware which surprised me since some reviewers said that it did n't come with the mounting hardware . It actually comes with plenty of extra because depending on your TV , you may need different sized bolts from someone else . Drilling the holes and mounting the arm into a stud on the wall was simple . One thing to note is that if you are mounting it on a stud , probability is that it will not be completely centered . No one seems to notice that our TV is not centered though . It is centered over the furniture so it looks centered . We were moving right along with the installation until we tried to screw the 4 bolts into the 400x400 holes on the plate to the back of the TV . It did n't fit . The holes did n't line up perfectly with the holes on the back of the TV . It was off by about a cm but that was enough to make it impossible to bolt to the 4 holes on the TV . My husband was not happy and took the plate with him Home Depot to look for a metal drill bit to make the hole bigger . Instead , the tool guy at Home Depot did it for him so he did n't buy a new bit . We then finally mounted to TV to the arm and all was good . The mount is very nice and it was easy to install . We sprayed it with silicon spray to make it easier to move . I 'd buy it again , but the manufacturer would fix the alignment of the 400x400 holes . 	TV
This did WORSE than my NON-amplified antenna -LRB- akin to zenith ZHDTV1 -RRB- it was meant to replace . But costs more to own and to use ! I had better luck with the amplified Samsung TV5 .2 antenna -LRB- shaped like a space ship\/B2 bomber -RRB- . This model did improve upon my directional\/non-amplified antenna in receiving HDTV signals . 	TV
Upon first install , my system would not boot past POST . Be warned if your mobo has a VIA chipset particularly if it is several years old . I have an Asus K8V Deluxe and thankfully a timely BIOS update was released that fixed the problem and the Hauppauge WinTV PVR 500 installed just fine alongside my Hauppauge PVR 250 . SageTV recognized the new dual tuners easily . Now that I have played around with the 500 at different quality settings , I can honestly say it does not compare to the 250 . The 500 seems to be a little weak with the cable signal as just a few channels are severely distorted like streaming water -LRB- in video only , audio seems ok although there could be more bass -RRB- while most are just a touch grainy or pixelized which is the best that can be hoped for . All channels have also a washed-out look and I have tried adjusting the Contrast & Brightness but no setting seems to make an improvement with the 500 . The 250 , meanwhile , is always visually clear and aurally dynamic so any blame of poor quality with the 250 is put solely on the broadcast of the cable channel being viewed . Even with the shortcoming of the 500 , it is still good enough at a low quality setting , and besides there are no more , or fewer , recording conflicts so it would be difficult to give up on it . I think , I hope anyway , that a driver update from Hauppauge would fix the quality issues so I will keep checking . 	TV
Very easy installation and the end result is amazing . Our 55 '' HDTV looks brand new again . The picture is bright , colorful and crisp . Wish we would have replaced the bulb earlier . 	TV
Needed a TV mount for outside patio and found a winner . Very solid and sturdy . Mounted a 32 '' Vizio in less that a 1\/2 hour . Instructions are pictures only , there are no words . Best advise is to lay out all parts on floor and group same\/like parts together . Simply matched up the parts needed for my TV . Once I figured out what parts were needed for my TV , the installation process was quite simple . Keep in mind this tv mount fits 25 '' to 40 '' screens . Smaller screens wo n't require all the parts\/brackets to be used . 	TV
I bought this radio primarily for use in my gym . What a disappointment . From the moment I turned it on , I knew it was not a keeper . There is audible background hiss even with the volume turned all the way down . As you turn the volume up , the hiss gets louder . Once the volume is high enough to drown out the hiss , the radio is too loud . Do n't buy it . 	TV
This mount would definatly be sold for 200 $ at any big box store . It is sturdy and solid with plenty of bolts , washers , spacers , etc. . Easy to instal , total confidence in placing big 50 '' plasma . One of the main reasons that I chose this one was all the mounting holes on the base plate . This ensured that I could mount the tv in the middle of the wall even if the studs were not on center . 	TV
Since getting the Vizio LED LCD-TV , I have found the setup was easy with the remote control and the built in Menu on-screen . The audio was crisp and clear at loud volumes as well as low . Picture quality was outstanding also . I think this Vizio 26 '' LED LCD-TV may just be the perfect TV . Also , I use this new Vizio as a computer monitor and it works great as a monitor too . I have n't hooked the monitor to the web yet but I plan to do this soon . I has already asked me to update the apps by connecting it to the internet . I own three -LRB- 3 -RRB- other LCD TVs ; one Emerson 37 '' , one Sharp 37 '' and one Vizio LCD-TV 20 '' , when I compare my NEW Vizio 26 '' to my other TVs it beats all of them hands down ... 	TV
HDTV and DVD - Video and Sound are amazing on this set . The viewing from all direction in the room was exceptional . Did not notice any depreciation in clarity or visibility from any viewing angle in the room . The speakers are attached to both ends of the screen . This give the unit a pleasant wider stance . Sound is above average . TV mounts like a picture frame on the wall . Wall mount is not included . I do n't think it is included with any LCD TV in the market . This LCD will set the trend to bring down the LCD TV prices . . 	TV
I was worried about this product as it was not directly from Samsung . After installing in my 56in DLP I have had no problems -LRB- 1 month at this point -RRB- and am very happy with the product . The TV is like new now . \*\* Update \*\* : About 45days of use the bulb flickers about 50 % of the time its in use , it can be annoying . I contacted Amazon and they offered to refund -LRB- even past the 30days -RRB- . Amazon as always did the right thing but I personally will move on to a new TV instead of getting another lamp . If you are going to spend the money , go with the Samsung made part and not this . 	TV
My father wanted to cancel cable TV and asked me to find an old-fashioned rooftop antenna , something he last used over 30 years ago . Unfortunately in those 3 decades the rooftop antenna has become somewhat of an endangered species , and none of the usual retailers carry them anymore , not even Fry 's and Radio Shack , just those lousy indoor models . So it was a relief to see Amazon carrying these . My father lives in the San Fernando Valley and per antennaweb.org he needed a medium-strength antenna to pick up the signals which are about 20-30 miles away . I decided to play it safe and get him one that would pick up signals 45-60 miles away . I had it shipped to my house first and although I have U-Verse I decided to try it out without installation . Even in the difficult terrain in my neighborhood it picked up all the channels except Fox HD 11.1 ; its SD equivalent 11.2 came in just fine . So I knew that in my father 's relatively flat area and with proper installation , it wo n't have a problem . The assembly instructions were a bit cryptic , and the crummy photos and diagrams were n't all that helpful . Eventually I figured out myself which parts go where . The antenna is broken down into two halves that slip together on a central pipe . There are two long rods that connect one half to the other -LRB- besides the central pipe -RRB- and at first they seem to be a tad too short , but after a bit of bending I got them to connect . The rest of the assembly is unfolding the various elements and connecting the part that connects the coaxial cable to the antenna . Except for the `` U '' clamp , all assembly uses wing nuts . My only other complaint is the `` U '' clamp , which let 's you clamp the antenna to a pipe . It was too small for any of the vent pipes on my father 's 60 y\/o house . He ended up improvising his own mount for it . Otherwise this is a good antenna and much cheaper than some of those `` amplified indoor antennas '' you tend to see in the stores today . 	TV
I love ours . The owner 's manual is fairly well written , once you are used to using the remote it is easy to get where you want to go . It has 5 different sets of hook ups at the rear and 1 set on the front for configuring your system however you want it to work . The only awkward thing is the on screen display of suggested system hook ups , rather difficult to see when you are BEHIND the television . We do n't have a large living room so it is not overpowering and at the same time it is easy to see from everywhere in the room . Remote can control your DVD player or VCR , though I may have to call Hitachi to see if it can be programmed to control my particular DVD player . Video adjustments are easy to do and may be programmed into the television itself . Everyone who has come over and seen it loves it . I hated to spend this kind of money but now I am glad I did - we were originally going for a 35 '' HDTV when the missus saw this one and fell in love with it . Only possible drawback will be if the competing HDTV signal processor is the winner , then we will have to buy an adaptor to make full use of this system . The audio is good though we usually run the sound through our surround sound receiver to preserve the speakers on the television - especially for those extra loud action\/drama movies . I did not even mention the 3 way picture-in-picture with its `` freeze '' mode , handy for writing down addresses and recipes off the screen without using a VCR to tape the information . 	TV
This is a fantastic unit . We decided to enter the high-tech world and go for this Westinghouse LCD wide screen TV . Ultra sharp and ultra bright picture and SO light weight ! Being able to enjoy DVD movies the way they were meant to be seen is fantastic . Also being able to use with our computer is such a great feature . Hope Westinghouse brings out a DVD Player soon . Will buy one as soon as they do ! No disappointments . we are very happy ! 	TV
It did not include the remote control which is necessary to operate the equipment . It was shown in the picture but did not arrive . I requested expedited shipment but it took a week to arrive . 	TV
This is by far the worst piece of equipment I have ever purchased !!! Easy to set up and get going ... Connected to my wireless network and downloaded updates pretty smoothly . Two days later the remote stopped controlling the blue ray player but still controlled the tv volume . Called customer service and they directed me to the website that shows you how to resync the remote . Duh , did that like 10 times !!! Took the unit back to Best Buy , and they said it worked great . They were right ... 2 days later , same thing . Replaced batteries and resynced remote . Worked great for a day !!! Unplugged pwr for 5 minutes and rebooted . Every thing worked great again . Guess what , yep , no response the next day . So now , everytime I wanna whatch a movie I have to unplug the unit to reset so it will work for 1-2 days . Very very unhappy with this purchase . \*\*\* UPDATE \*\*\*\* Sent it back to BestBuy . Got a refurbished unit back ??? So I bought a brand new unit , used it a half doezen times , and now Sony decides a used refurbished unit is okay ?? This is the last piece of Sony equipment I ever buy !!!! JUNK !!!! I am furious !!! 	TV
AVOID BUYING THIS ITEM FROM AMAZON . The TV itself is probably excellent . But unless you 're home all the time to receive it , getting the shipment from UPS or getting a customer service response from Amazon is pure hassle . UPS had this item ` out for delivery ' . I took a day off and stayed in earshot of the door . Nothing . At 6am the following morning -LRB- this morning -RRB- I called UPS . They wo n't make the shipment available for me to pickup . The call center forwards two messages to the facility . But there 's no point in attempting delivery . This shipment requires a signature . No one will be home to sign for it . So I drive to the UPS facility , knowing darn well this box is on a truck and they can pull it off . Which the agent at the counter does . But while I 'm staring at the box , I get a call from UPS on my cell phone . Janet -LRB- UPS agent at the facility -RRB- says the shipment is out for delivery , sorry about that . In other words , she does n't feel like going and getting the box to put in will call . I am not making this up . And it gets worse . While all this nonsense is transpiring , I examine the box closely -LRB- it 's good and beat up -RRB- and see that it is a LT27 , NOT the LT30 that I paid for . So after all this , I have to refuse the shipment because it is the wrong merchandise from Amazon . For Amazon 's part , like others have commented , there is no real customer service . I dug around clicking and looking . You can send an email . Obviously customer service is not one of their strengths . My unit will go back undelivered , despite my efforts to retrieve it myself . Amazon , eventually , I assume , will credit me for the failed order fulfillment . Eventually . Now I 'm looking to buy the Olevia elsewhere , as I definitely still want it . Somewhere with a customer service phone number . And who ships FedEx . \*\*\*\*\*\*\* UPDATE \*\*\*\*\*\*\* There are plenty of places to buy this unit with good customer service and who ship FedEx . The folks at IBuy Digital called me -LRB- not me trying in vain to reach them -RRB- to verify information about the order . And as always , FedEx was right on schedule . I can just about set my clock by these guys . Important points about the LCD buyers may value , in no particular order . If using as a monitor , you need a deep workspace . I had to rework mine . The minimum comfortable distance for me with this LCD is more than 4 feet . Most desks are n't that deep . Resolution and refresh are critical . I settled on 1280x960 at 60Hz . I also found a ClearType Tuner power tool to finesse the text to be as clear as possible . I am using a 2PC KVM , with just a VGA connection to the Olevia . With resolutions and refresh set the same , the only issue is sometimes switching back and forth the Olevia sets brightness and contrast back to defaults . It takes 10 seconds to fix . I have a PC attached to the Olevia with an ATI All In Wonder . Easylook Media Center with remote is a nice way to use this unit . Text is OK . My wife thinks detailed graphics work might be difficult . I will probably try it anyway . Games look fantastic . Composite video and DVD from a PC also look fantastic . Analog TV shows itself for what it is , crap . This is something that goes unnoticed until you directly A-B analog TV with composite DVD video . I will switch to HDTV immediately . Which brings up PIP . This unit has true dual NTSC tuners , which is true PIP . But for HDTV , you still need a set top HDTV box from the cable company . So there 's a compromise in there . There 's also a limitation with split screen and PIP . Inputs are in ` groups ' , so you ca n't always get the combination you want . I 'm having no trouble with the remote . But I 'm always in proximity to the LCD . As others have commented , you have to use the right arrow key in lot of settings where Enter makes more sense . It 's stupid , but you just get used to it . Overall , you will get immediately spoiled with one of these . The dual 19 's at my mixing console suddenly look a little small . Did I mention games and video look fantastic ? 	TV
Hi , this is the perfect media player for all Latin american people thats wants to see netflix . I have all of them and this is the best and fast of all . 	TV
Purchased this wireless adapter for my new 60 '' Panasonic Viera Plasma TV . While the setup was easy , my Internet connection kept dropping while watching Netflix . Ended up sitting in front of my tv watching the rest of the movie on my iPad using the same wireless connection without any problem . Product is going right back to Amazon . For those techies out there , I am using a Netgear N600 dual band Router . 	TV
My goal was to avoid an outside antenna , yet still receive all local stations , one VHF and 8 UHF -LRB- 21 total sub-channels -RRB- . The stations range from 15 to 37 miles from my house over fairly flat terrain . The directions to their transmitter towers vary from 302 deg to 4 deg -LRB- a 62 degree spread -RRB- so I avoided any highly directional antenna -LRB- I do n't want the hassle of a rotor -RRB- . I removed the head off an old camera tripod and bolted the Winegard FV-HD30 onto the extended vertical aluminum tube . Once placed in the attic -LRB- about 11 feet above ground level -RRB- I found that , like all indoor antennas , moving it around was necessary to find the reception `` sweet spot '' . Often , just moving an antenna a couple of feet to one side makes a world of difference . When I found the ideal placement the signal strength meter on my living room TV -LRB- about 40 feet of coax from the antenna -RRB- was pegged on all 21 sub-channels . I then inserted a 2-way splitter near the antenna and added the bedroom TV -LRB- about 12 feet of coax -RRB- . Due to the signal reduction of the splitter I feared than I might have to buy and install a pre-amp or distribution amplifier , but I found it was n't necessary . All sub-channels are great on both TVs , even with 4 inches of snow on the roof for several days last week . The signal strength on two stations dropped from 10 bars to 8 bars after installing the splitter , but that still provides 100 % perfect picture and sound . All of my expectations were met or exceeded by this little antenna and I highly recommend it . 	TV
This is a beautiful television , but it 's coming to light that there were manufacturing problems , resulting in a large number of sets leaving the factory that die within weeks of purchase , by being unable to power up . See http:\/\/www.avsforum.com\/avs-vb\/showthread.php?s=&threadid=316921 for details . Mine died after 6 days . Let 's hope the replacement does n't have them same problems . 	TV
Amazon guaranteed a low price on this vizio M261VP television . Before you purchase it , make sure you contact Amazon for the price match policy . The Costco website is selling this tv for $ 279.00 . The Amazon rep who was professional and courteous , said it was for a limited time when it is on sale for a whole month -LRB- 2\/3\/11 - 2\/27\/11 -RRB- on Costco Web site . As per Amazon 's rep , the one month time period is just like a Black Friday or Early Bird special as it 's stated in their price guarantee policy . Amazon could not match the Costco price . Therefore , I 'll buy this from Costco . 	TV
The trinitron technology is generally acknowledge as the most superior TV technology and it 's evident as to why . The clarity is better than any TV I 've owned before . The colors are crisp and the interface is simple . The screen is also flatter than other comparable models reducing glare . Overall an excellent unit . 	TV
Purchased this item by reading the other positive reviews on Amazon . After about 10 minutes of setup , I am quite satisfied . The transmitter and receiver do have to be near each other . I have the transmitter and receiver about 6 feet away and it works fine . Any further and the sound cuts out . Windows Vista did not like the firmwear update the company offered on the website and would not install it but did n't need to . Overall a fine inexpensive alternative to cable TV . Watch your favorite shows online on your big screen TV . By the way , read the instructions first . You must install the driver from the CD before hooking up the transmitters . 	TV
Our first LG product , and for the the first month 's performance we are very pleased . The set up and controls were very easy to operate . The picture quality is what you would expect from fine tv . As far as sound quality , it is adaquate . You 're not going to get big booming sound from any tv . We have been dealing through Amazon for quite some time for many of our purchases and they have never disappointed us . Kudos to Amazon and LG . 	TV
This product listing is wrong , the pictures show the true card , a Diamond Stealth S90 fx5200 128MB . It is NOT the eVGA fx5200 256MB card . 	TV
There is finally a true tablet OS , not a frustrating implementation of desktop OS -LRB- think UMPCs -RRB- or an inflated and over extended phone OS -LRB- iOS\/iPad , Galaxy Tab , and other android ` tablets ' -RRB- . It 's really impressive to see and use and feels like a new OS , just one that 's based on the Android we all known -LRB- and love -RRB- . The implementation is good , remarkably good for a brand new OS that only really exists on one device -LRB- officially I mean , we know you can stuff this on a Nook -RRB- . It 's far from perfect , but again it 's very nice for a first shot . There are bugs , but nothing show stopping -LRB- the music icon pops up again and again long after I 've stopped playing it -RRB- and nothing that should n't be resolved in due course . There are some shortcomings with the software -LRB- the browser is jittery and more than a few websites only load mobile versions -LRB- I know you can enter debug mode or use another browser , but I do n't want to do that all the time and I do n't care for Dolphin or Skyfire -RRB- , there seems to be a lot of blank\/white space in the applications that might be better used , and the widgets start to look weird on non-blue backgrounds -LRB- notice most of the ones included are blue -RRB- -RRB- but again , they should be worked out and improved in time . Where it falls in this particular implementation is mostly hardware . I 'm not a fan of the fingerprint and dust magnet that is the screen -LRB- it 's really terrible -RRB- . Also , the screen just is n't that good . It might be fine compared to some cheaper laptops but it gets incredably washed out at higher brightness and has only `` OK '' viewing angles . I 'll note that I 'm more sensative to these things than other people , but I 'd really like to see one of these with an IPS screen -LRB- like on the iPad -RRB- . -LRB- -1 star -RRB- Personally , while the device is nice , it does n't fill a need or purpose for me . To me a tablet should be more about entertainment and creating a more personal experience than I can get with laptop . This , for the time , just fails at that . Part of it is just the methodology used here . Each time I use the tablet for something that 's truely unique to it -LRB- say versus my iPad or my Nexus S -RRB- I feel I 'd just rather do it on my laptop for a better experience . I 've found a use for my iPad and specifics for when it 's best -LRB- e.g. curling up in bed to watch netflix when a phone would be too small and a laptop too noisy\/cumbersome\/distracting -RRB- , but I have n't with this . I guess the obvious reason for that is just lack of applications that I want in a tablet . There 's no Netflix , no Hulu , no working version of Pandora , etc. . These should be solved eventually , but there 's no timeline for this from any of those companies . -LRB- -1 star -RRB- While I know some may argue that it 's unfair to judge a product that is fresh out of the gate and that software will come , the issue is that new hardware will come as well . There 's also the issue that due to different hardware and such hulu or netflix may never come to this specific device -LRB- Hulu has stated ` select devices ' for whenever they get their android version out , and netflix seems to need specific DRM capable hardware as far as they 're claiming now - this could change , but who knows -RRB- . With quad-core Tegra chips coming late fall , rumors of a Nexus tablet , and whatever else happens in the next 6 months , I have to judge what a product is based on what it is now or will be in the immediate future . Maybe Netflix and Hulu will put out android versions , but it may be another year and a much better tablet . I still think this is a great product , but it 's just not for me . Baring the screen quality -LRB- again it may not bother you as much -RRB- this is a really solid device . If you need a lightweight and portable device this is a very solid and viable alternative to say a netbook . But as my friend commented `` If one gets Netflix , I might get one . '' I kind of have to agree with that . 	Tablet
I purchased this product and was completed excited about getting it . Finally my shipment arrived , I turned the power on and it lasted for about 30 seconds !! I plugged it into the adapter all night and NOTHING !! I went to Radio Shack and bought a replacement adapter ... NOTHING !! This thing does n't work , there is no customer service to speak of , company is in China and no one called me back !!! The seller will not return any of my emails . 	Tablet
I ordered it knowing it 's flaws and thinking I could live with them . It looked impressive and felt really good . If you 've never used and capacitve screen you 'd probably be ok with it . I bought it thinking I could open up the market , which I did easily and that it could get the kids off my phone . I ended up sending it back , not because it 's bad it 's just there is or willl be much better out there and I 'm willing to wait . 	Tablet
I bought this tablet thinking it would be able to do everyday tasks . It is horrible . The touch screen is resistive instead of capacitive . The wifi always has trouble connecting . It struggles to play music and videos smoothly and gets bogged down easy . The build quality is cheap . All in all I rated this one star which I think is generous . I am currently trying to return it and sent it in but have n't recieved any mention of them getting it . If your looking to get a tablet for under 200 dollars I would look at the velocity micro cruz or just save up for an ipad or any other tablet . 	Tablet
I bought this for my sister for her website and she likes it alot . I am very pleased with how happy it made her . 	Tablet
Great product , easy to use and take anywhere . Many apps free or very cheap . Highly recommended for anyone trying to decide which tablet to buy . Only drawback , does n't support Adobe Flash . 	Tablet
I think that this is a excellent mp3 player plus more . I had a Zen vision w before and had to replace it and this was the perfect replacement . The apps are excellent for this product . con - the volume is low . Does n't come with TV connection -LRB- you have to buy the add on -RRB- These is my only issues so far overall - this is an excellent product . Money well spent . With 500 gig you cant go wrong . I put my entire music collection on this and still have 300 gig . 	Tablet
I 've only had this for a week , and I admit that the learning curve is fairly steep . It 's a disappointment if you 're used to Kindles , as I am . For a serious reader , this is heavy and cumbersome . The apps that should easily download , finding them as I did on the `` CruzMarket '' loaded on the device , wo n't download . There seems to be a problem because it says that there is n't enough space , which seems unlikely . No one at Velocity Cruz will answer the question , apparently support is not their strong suit , so I 'm hoping maybe someone out there knows the magic answer . It 's clearly a problem for a lot of people . It 's good to get your email , check FB , and the only extra I wanted was a To Do list . Apparently that 's not possible . The heaviness and general difficulty coping with books , there are glitches , make me want to return this and go back to the Kindle . If you 're really after a reader , I 'm afraid this is n't it . If you hoped to download other apps , it does n't seem to work there either . The company really needs to upgrade the customer service and the manual is useless . All in all , it 's a big disappointment . 	Tablet
Got this with a lot of excitement . But that 's where it ends . Pros : Good screen size Good Hardware options -LRB- hdmi , usb , sd card etc -RRB- Good weight and form factor Cons : Horrible touch response Software is sluggish at best Personalizing screen is a hassle Streaming vdo is choppy and pix-elated Screen orientation locks up and does n't respond even if you tilt it and tap Apps die frequently Overall not worth spending $ 400 on it . I 'm looking at Motorola Xoom now ! 	Tablet
Very Good Cover . Good protection , and fit the Tablet . and Make my tablet looks very Luxury . by the Price , you can not Asking any More . 	Tablet
Was a gift for my son . He loves it . Likes that it has flash and can play videos unlike an ipad . I would say a great value for the money . 	Tablet
A great purchase , i really recomend it , the delivery was ok , and the tablet is fine i 've been using it for a week know and i havent had no problems , the pakage had everihing and it was in perfect conditions , you can trust this seller : -RRB- 	Tablet
bought for the price , but when I tried it , I did not get a good feeling while and there is no big difference between the finger and the pen . One of the broke as well . 	Tablet
The product is as described , but clearly forgot how to be a useful item . THE NEGATIVES 1 . The keyboard attaches via a usb connection , forcing you to leave the side port cover open in order to use the product . 2 . The stitching is horrible . It arrived new from the seller with undone stitching and after only a few uses it already is coming undone . 3 . The case itself is clearly not designed for the thrive . There is no rear camera hole . The clips to hold the thrive in place do so on the sides and bottom , but the top one does not clamp down . Leaving the thrive the ability to slide out . 4 . There are no stylus holders . 5 The kickstand on the back is simple and frequent falls down when in use . Making it very difficult to keep the screen upright . THE POSITIVES 1 . The keyboard is a good quality and typing is very smooth . 2 . The case itself looks pretty nice , the texture is very professional looking . Overall , the positives do not outweigh the negatives . While the keyboard is a huge help when in meetings and having it bundled with a case is even better , I do not like having the poor functionality of the case , so I end up swapping out cases when in meetings with high note-taking vs those with minimal notes .

works just as represented . for a writer , indispensable ! use it all the time . will surely purchase another . AA all the way ! 	Tablet
this thing is great if you update the firmware , which you can do from the settings , but if you dont upgrade to 2.2 froyo then you wont be able to access the google marketplace , what you need to do is install the 3rd party apps when you set up the droid , then you use appslib -LRB- which is a small , easy to use place to get basic apps -LRB- although not nearly as cool as the actuall google marketplace -RRB- -RRB- to get arctools , which will give you access to the google marketplace after opening up arctools and downloading and installing the google tools , after the reboot , you will have complete access to the google marketplace , and all the apps . : -RRB- hope this helped .

\*\*\* Update 12\/15\/10 \*\*\*\*\* After a lot of tinkering , resetting Android and more tinkering : I did pair and tether this with a bluetooth phone . Media cataloging and UPnP media streaming , while slow to connect , does work perfectly . Not sure what changed other than a lot of patience . Some items that I thought were not working just needed to be left alone for a bit and eventually would go thru . However Wifi seems to only connect at G speeds when all my other devices connect easily at N speeds . One tablet of the two still seems buggy and is locking up - I 'm sure I can get it sorted out eventually - I keep searching the archos fan forums and reading what others have gone thru and what fixes they know of and it helps a lot . With a little more work , both of these will be perfect tablets . \*\*\* Update 12\/11\/10 \*\*\* Upon further use , I have realized that some things aeem to not be working with the latest firmware release , and in searching the forums I am reading where others have the same problems - I still like the tablets , and hopefully these issues will be fixed in future firmware updates , but please be aware that : Bluetooth - So far I can pair these with bluetooth phones , however they both say not connected no matter which phone I pair them with - seems to be an issue with the tablet itself and no matter what I 've tried , I ca n't actually connect them to cell phones using bluetooth -LRB- for tethering , or using the phones GPS -RRB- UPNP media streaming seems to be glitchy - sometimes it streams just fine , other times not at all . Media cataloging also seems glitchy - sometimes it includes and indexes video files on the micro-sdhc card and sometimes it does n't - they are always accessible , it just sometimes randomly seems to not pick these files up as videos and makes you browse to the sd card itself to play them . Performance seemed to improve quite a bit when I moved all apps to the internal storage as opposed to the system storage . SO , while I still really like the tablets , I am not quite as enthusiastic as I was in the beginning - but I am optimistic that they will release an updated firmware to address these issues and then I will rate them 5 stars again . \*\*\*\*\*\* Original Review \*\*\*\*\* - I love these tablets - I bought two and have tried both out and they are fabulous . First off , you should install updated firmware to upgrade to Android 2.2 -LRB- Froyo -RRB- as doing this later will cause you to have to re-set everything up later . Initially I was disappointed because there was no access to the Android Marketplace and the Archos apps were buggy , crappy or borderline pornography -LRB- not cool Archos - I bought these for kids ! -RRB- , but then I googled and found gapps4archos2 - make sure it 's the latest because the original does n't work on Froyo - and after installing it I then had the Google Marketplace , which is really what makes or breaks an android tablet - from there on out , it was all good - great apps , great functionality , etc. . Some things are not there yet - for instance , why ca n't I skype video chat on a tablet ? it has a webcam , it 's not due to the tablet limitations - its all Skype who is behind the times - come on Skype - we want video chat on android via wifi !!!! Facebook works well , youtube does not due to the lack of included flash , I supposed . However I loaded flash 10.1 and video was choppy - so I just installed the Dolphin Browser app which is a must have browser replacement which then plays youtube videos perfectly . It plays mp3 's perfectly out of the box , and divx movies out of the box with no issues - which is a huge must for me . I want my kids to be able to watch divx movies on the device while in the car . Lots of little games available from the marketplace . My kids are gonna be 2 happy campers this year at Christmas ! As for touchscreen calibration that some say they experienced , I have had none of that - it is very accurate and very responsive . Likewise I have no problems with the MicroSD reader that another reviewer complained about - both read my card easily with no issues . I bought these as a mobile video\/entertainment solution for my kids that also works great as a study helper for looking up info on the fly and this fits the bill exactly . I also installed the Kindle for Android app so my kids can read the classics available free from Kindle Store - and I must say , it is an excellent e-reader - very clear print ! I wish I had ordered 2 more for my husband and myself . When you figure out the price of a kindle reader , a movie player , an mp3 player , a game player , plus internet and homework helper , plus email and facebook -LRB- what have I left out ? seems like it does it all -RRB- then this little tablet works out to be an incredible value .

I am a business user -LRB- senior management and MBA student -RRB- . I 'm not much of a gamer . I am an avid Android user with my mobile phone , so in determining whether to buy this , the reviews that talked about performance , `` rooting '' , `` romming '' and screen viewing angles was foreboding . However , I really needed a tab for school - and it was a 7 inch or a 10 inch . Why buy a 7 inch when for a few more bucks , I could buy this with good hardware ? So I decided to give it a try . First - all the info about the software - the latest rom that comes with the Gtab , as of around April - is a huge improvement over the infamous one that was panned and criticized earlier in the year and late in 2010 . But still , loading up a nice rom is a simple proposition for moderately technical users . As of 7\/13 , I have tried Vegan 1.5.1 -LRB- Froyo -RRB- , Vegan Gingerbread Stable RC1 and Vanilla 1.03 AOSP -LRB- also Gingerbread -RRB- . By far , 1.5.1 is the best for a number of reasons . So do n't get too hung up on having the latest Gingerbread - and I would n't even bother with the latest 3.0 Honeycomb roms . For a student\/business user like me -LRB- with a little youtube for fun -RRB- , 1.5.1 is it ! So what about the screen ? It is a very narrow angle for viewing , but it 's fine . It looks a lot worse with darker material like movies if at a non-optimal angle - but bright material like biz apps are fine ! This truly is not a deal breaker for me . As it is , this is a high performance , quality tab and I enjoy using it . It 's a huge improvement over lugging a laptop to class and regarding showing pdf , pptx , xlsx , etc. . If you 're a serious user who is not tech savvy , the latest ROM will be fine . But if you want to have even more control , do the Vegan 1.5.1 rom and do n't look back ! Oh and Angry Birds works great ! 	Tablet
I purchased my T-301 through a brick and mortar retailer . The t301 freezes constantly . The browser crashed repeatedly . It is painfully slow . After installing the firmware update from their website , the t-301 wont start at all . If that were n't enough it took velocity 5 days after submitting a support request , just to tell me that they wanted a copy of my receipt . Apparently registering your product is n't enough . Now I 'm back to waiting . I do n't know how long it will actually take to address the issue . I 'm not talking about an older , abused unit either . My T-301 has less than 10 hours use - mostly because it kept crashing and\/or freezing and I got tired of messing with it . If you buy one , keep a paper clip nearby , you 'll probably need it to reset the tablet every few minutes . 	Tablet
This is my first stylus , so I do n't have much to compare it to , but as far as I can tell , it works great and the pen on the other side is useful ... for the few times that I need to use paper . What I like most about this stylus is when it 's paired with the iPad 2 SmartCover . When moving around the office , I can stick the stylus to the side of the SmartCover and walk around without worrying about where I left the stylus . It relies on the magnets in the cover and since the stylus is steel it sticks to the cover . It 's probably unintentional feature , but very handy . 	Tablet
Our company purchased 12 of these for our salesmen . Mysteriously at month 11 of a 12 month warranty , the mice went banannas . This was THE most painful repair process I have ever gone through . Viewsonic refused to repair these , knowing this was a common defect , until I came up with proof of purchase for each one . There are many other fine tablets out there , find one of them instead .

This iPad was used but it was better than new caus it includes a screen saver and a cover . Everything about the iPad 2 is mint . 	Tablet
There are many reviews here , and a new model is coming out now -LRB- which I have pre-ordered from Amazon -RRB- . The Amazon Appstore is open now , so the Appslib issue is no longer . You can install the Amazon Appstore and get apps very easily . With the Kindle App , this Kyros -LRB- this model -RRB- is a perfect book reader . I bought this after trying a Nook . With the free Amazon Kindle app , the Kyros turns into one of the best deals I 've seen . It is more portable -LRB- and capable in many ways -RRB- than larger tablets . It is more open as well . In addition to this , it is the size of the most popular ebook readers , and their apps work on it fine . The new 7 '' model coming out soon seems to have been given many upgrades . It has a better CPU , more refined hardware -LRB- as guessed from the photos of it -RRB- , and a camera and some new hardware features . Even if that model and this were out at the same time when I bought this one , this one would still be a good thing to buy if it were less expensive than the new model -LRB- which it is , by $ 30 -RRB- . The Kindle with WiFi only costs $ 139 , the Nook Color costs $ 249 , an iPad costs ... a lot . The Kyros with the Kindle -LRB- or Nook -RRB- app costs about $ 140 at this time , plus , you get a full tablet experience . That being written , it still has limitations , but they are not secrets . It is much more capable than more expensive tablets and ebook readers , and it does not force you to use it in a certain way . It can be used for multimedia , Internet browsing\/Youtube , games , ebook reading of all sorts , and anything else one can do with Android and the hardware this has . 	Tablet
This was a great idea to purchase this headset . My current client requires multiple Live Meeting conference calls -LRB- sometimes in a day -RRB- a week and this allows me the ability to multi-task without being tied to my laptop or a desk . Sound quailty and boom mike clarity is GREAT ! The added Plus ... when not on Conference calls , my music sounds great as I work thru the day !!! 	Tablet
I 've owned a Xoom for about 7 months now . For the most part it has a solid , sturdy build . Just lately I 've noticed the ultra-tiny charging jack and plug on mine has become a loose fit . But so far that has been the only hardware disappointment . On the whole , ice cream sandwich is very nice and the degree of Android `` polish '' is improving all the time . The Xoom is a very handy device to consume content from the internet . It 's fast and smooth . Most of the apps , especially the tablet targeted apps , are excellent . Google Maps is excellent . Wi-fi is easy to configure and connect . It even takes good looking pictures and movies . You can encrypt the tablet 's content which is a huge comfort when taking it away from home . It 's terrific for reading email , and with the external keyboard it is good for casual email writing . But do n't expect an Android device , even a 1st rate tablet like the Xoom , to replace a full Windows -LRB- or Mac -RRB- computer . It ca n't . Even the basic `` office '' style applications like Google docs are n't quite up to professional standards yet . Need a spreadsheet beyond a few rows of simple calculations , or a database application ? Forget it . Sure , you can create documents but it 's nowhere near the experience you 'll have on a true laptop . I bought the highest rated tablet office app and I never use it . -LRB- It was worth a shot , I 've spent $ 20 in more foolish ways . -RRB- As for input , even with an external keyboard , there 's often a typing lag and awkward feel to the keys . In short the Xoom is perfect for convenient use on the couch , reading the news before bed , or for staying connected during a long weekend away from home . There 's a built in browser that works surprisingly well . It has more than enough battery to get through at least one day . Knowing where it shines , and it limitations , is the key to enjoying the Xoom . Honestly if I had it to do over , I 'd seriously consider an ultrabook .

I 've been using the Intuos 6 x 8 for 4 years now and it has been good . It draws cartoons in Flash well -LRB- if I zoom it to at least 200 % -RRB- , and lately I 'd been thinking of upgrading to a larger wacom and I 've found it really difficult to find a good review anywhere so here is my take on wacoms . <p> I 'd always been under the impression that I could n't draw as well on a 6 x 8 compared to a 9 x 12 , but that was purely psychological . The truth is if you zoom in 200 % and draw at 200 % then the accuracy is just as good as a 9 x 12 wacom at 100 % zoom . Only thing is I like to see the whole canvas at one time . I 've upgraded now to an Intuos 2 9 x 12 and it works like a dream ! Logically it should be no different from a ' 6 x 8 working at 200 % zoom ' , but somehow the feel of the pen is wonderful , and it draws beautifully and more easily ! -LRB- or it may just be psychological -RRB- . For those with 6 x 8 wacoms I found a neat tip that makes them just as good as 9 x 12s -LRB- except that the feel is different , or that may just be psychological -RRB- and that is , if you change it to the mouse setting , and make the speed to the slowest one possible -LRB- turtle -RRB- , then you should get the same accuracy as a 9 x 12 working at 100 % zoom . However because the space is small you 'd need to lift the pen when you run out of space . But that does n't really matter . Actually maybe because my 9 x 12 is an Intuos2 instead of an Intuos -LRB- and I do n't know the difference between the two -RRB- , maybe that 's why I feel that I like it better . It 's hard judging these things . I 'd say it 's best to find out what works for you . <p> -LRB- ... -RRB- to see an example of a picture I did using the Intuos2 9 x 12 . 	Tablet

A must have ! A great tool for anyone who 's serious and will spend a lot of time doing CG stuff . I suffered from arthritis , using even an ergonomic multi-button mouse does n't levitate the pain after hours of shifting and clicking , but after switching to the pen tablet , the pain and stiffness of the fingers and shoulder subside as long as I remember not to sit and work for hours w\/o breaks . The packaging is nicely done , the step by step presentation and reviewing of the product is also a fun and `` inviting '' process , well thought-out . Good job , packaging team . I have only two suggestions : 1 \/ Wacom should consider making Small Pen Tablet wireless too . 2 \/ More switchable programed buttons for different software used . 	Tablet
This product worked as advertised right out of the box . Just make sure you have an HDMI cable and plug everything to their respective cables and voila you can see your phone on your HDTV . 	Tablet
perfect case for the touchpad . Looks sleek and professional , has 3 viewing angles , does n't block any ports or the speakers , and works with the HP touchstone charging dock . Also works great with the HP keyboard . Wo n't protect from drops or water but none of the other cases will either . Some might not like the flap design but for my needs its perfect . 	Tablet
I needed a tablet for a design course I 'm taking , and this was a good choice for me , because of its portable size , and included software -LRB- I use corel painter a lot -RRB- . The only thing that bothers me is that the pen goes from being too sensitive to almost non-existent when I try using it ... it was really frustrating at first , but I suppose you have to be really deliberate in where you want the pen to go\/and have to adjust the settings accordingly . I 've never had a tablet before , so honestly , I 'm just glad to have it , and I think it was worth the money . 	Tablet

I had tried a tablet once before but ended up returning it because I did n't like it and it was too small for me to do much with . The box this comes in is very impressive and very large , it protects the tablet well . There are new drivers online so I downloaded them instead of using the cd from the box . The driver seems to work well with XP but there is sometimes a lag when trying to select a menu function on screen . This tablet is fairly large and gives a good surface for creativity and the extra nibs are included in the little stand that holds the pen , to make the creativity happen and give a different feel to the pen . the pen is very sensitive and feels almost like a regular pen . I too do n't care for the way the mouse moves , the mouse can only be used on the tablet and the tablet is not completely smooth so the mouse moves slower than what I am used to . I installed it on my laptop so I can play with it in the family room and it does not disable my logitech mouse so I can switch to my regular mouse when I want to . -LRB- the other tablet ` bamboo fun ' I had tried would disable my regular mouse completely -RRB- Since I have not used one of these tablets regularly it does take some getting used to but once I get the hang of how everything moves and the feel of it I will be able to create a variety of art . I have n't figured out the touch ring as of yet , there is definitely a learning curve here for those of us that have never used these much . I do like that the buttons and the touch ring can be customized . This is a fun and useful tool and should get the creative juices running , the larger size makes it much nicer to use and handle . I checked on the free software online but the top plugins do n't state what version they are for , they should be more specific on what versions this can be used for and the links are n't clickable right now either , so maybe they have not finalized the website ? I ca n't use the ones listed at the bottom of the page since my software is older than specified for those applications . If you have the extra money , this is a great little tablet that will give you and\/or your kids enjoyment and creativity . I will have to update this at another time when I have had more time to play with it and get the feel of the functions better . 	Tablet
I had been using the iPad 2 for a year and wanted another tablet for my wifey . After I received it I find the tablet is lighter and speedier than the iPad 2 for the general purpose consumption I have usually reading\/streaming movies and music and light gaming . The more I used it the more I find it interesting and good value for money . Thanks for this good Tablet product . 	Tablet

i was excited about this purchase but was forced to return it . I was not aware it did not support flash , or anything like flash . So , it was ultimately useless for the person I purchased it for . 	Tablet
We 've had the epson artisan 837 for about 7 weeks now and had to replace the cartridges that came with the printer . This is where the trouble begins . The replacement cartridges we bought are authentic epson cartridges and the damn thing says it does n't recognize the cartridges . We have reseated and rebooted this thing until we 're ready to throw it out the window . It 's going back tomorrow . Oh another neat feature , even if you only have one color cartridge that is low or out it wo n't even let you print anything , not even something in black . You are forced to go buy a replacement cartridge for the one that it deems empty before it will let you print . I do n't know what kind of animal you have to sacrifice to get this thing to work but all the positive reviews have GOT to be done by epson marketing people . DO NOT BE FOOLED , this thing is junk ! On top of all that I just spent $ 90 to buy all new ink and it still does n't work ! Back to HP for me ! Oh and the one star is being kind but Amazon wo n't let me rate lower . 	Tablet
As a relatively new iPad user , my right hand began to ache from pointing at things on my iPad screen . I have arthritis in my right hand and the stylus helps prevent some of the pain . I like the styling of this product and it appeared to be well made , but after one month of use , the black tip fell off and wo n't stay on the stylus . 	Tablet
I would have rated it a `` 0 '' , but Amazon 's system would n't let me ... I wanted an Archos because of its capabilities and because I trusted the brand name . I had ordered it directly from Archos , but I could n't get it to connect to any wifi , so I returned it . But because of a miscommunication , they did n't replace it , just refunded my money . Feeling that it was a fluke -LRB- and Archos had it backordered -RRB- , I ordered the same model from Amazon . Although I did manage to get it to connect to our home wifi , it would only stay connected a few minutes and then disconnect . Ca n't get much done that way ! So I returned it -LRB- again ! -RRB- for a full refund . Archos tech support was friendly and responsive , but could n't fix the problem ; I had no trouble getting the refund from either place , but I would have rather had a working tablet ! 	Tablet
Carlos R `` Chinito77 '' -LRB- DC Metro Area -RRB- did the best review -LRB- with two stars -RRB- . Please refer to that . -LRB- IMHO it should have been 0 or 1 star as 2-3 stars - we rarely read -RRB- I am going to return this after a week of usage on iphone and ipad . The most frustrating part is it misses some depressions - how can you sell such a product for data input - even Speech Recognition runs in 90 + % hit rate these days . If stylus does 50-60 % , it better be called `` Stylus - Yuck !!! '' . 	Tablet

The Viewsonic G-Tablet is the fastest product on the market to date . For ~ $ 300 you get dual processors with fast video performance . The only con is that it comes pre-installed with a custom Android . Users will need someone who has -LRB- minimal -RRB- skills to install an new rom like at -LRB- ... -RRB- to access the `` full '' android market . The only problem I ran into which caused `` force close '' errors . Whereby user data got corrupt . Just re-install a ROM . It only happened twice in the months I 've had it . Totally awesome product at $ 300 . However , if $ $ $ is not an issue for you , stick with the iPad . 	Tablet
Bought this around the Christmas timeframe . Used it twice to test it , put it in my purse in a pen slot , and when I took it out this past weekend to use it , the rubber nib had fallen off ! What a waste of money ! Not recommended at all . 	Tablet
Very impressive design . Slim , light -LRB- relatively -RRB- , and with all the features you could want ... BUT ... Unfortunately , the unit I received appears to suffer from manufacturing\/quality defects . On the first day of significant use , I noticed that after the unit has been on for a few minutes -LRB- ~ 15-20 -RRB- , the screen develops \* several \* areas of discoloration ... Blue background appears yellowish ; black background has what seems to be a bluish light bleeding through , etc. . The largest area of discoloration is approximately 2 inches by 0.5 inches , so it 's definitely ` noticeable ' . A second area of concern : I logged a trouble ticket with ASUS , but have received no response -LRB- for 5 days now , and counting -RRB- . When you pay this much for a tablet , you expect support . Other areas of concern -LRB- though more minor than the two listed above -RRB- : - The touch screen is out of calibration in the top corner , and I was unable to find any utility for calibrating it . The mis-calibration is slight ... only about 1\/4 of an inch , but it is enough to cause you to select the wrong menu item in that corner . - The Processor speed rating -LRB- in the `` Windows Experience Index '' page -RRB- is quite slow ; slower , in fact , than my 4-year-old Toshiba Tablet with an Intel Core2 Duo processor ... that was surprising . I expected the EP121 's Core i5-470 to be somewhat faster , but the `` Windows Experience Index '' assessment sub-score is 3.1 -LRB- versus 3.2 for my 4-year-old Core2 Duo -RRB- . All in all , I was originally quite eager to get my hands on this tablet , but in light of the above , I am now regretting the purchase . 	Tablet
I have been using my Graphire -- not Graphire 3 Tablet for over 3 years . First with Paint Shop Pro 8 and now with PSP 9 . Using a regular mouse now would be like holding a block of wood in my hands . I work on the computer painting and writing for about 10 hours or more per day . I used to have really bad pains in my right wrist and near my elbow from a mouse . With the Wacom Tablet and pen , I do n't have this at all . I can do everything with the Wacom Graphire Tablet and pen , except type -LRB- LOL -RRB- . I love painting in the 4 X 5 area and make huge paintings with my little Graphire . As far as the pen behaving differently -- it wo n't if you take the time to set it up how you want it . Mine is set up to touch my pad once so programs or windows from my desktop flip up immediately . Never did like to double click on anything : - -RRB- Also I am hard handed -LRB- I was even this way using regular artist brushes -RRB- so I love that my tablet is not touchy because I set it up this way . Plus I can right click on the pen as I diabled the left click mechanism on it . I used my Graphire so much , I wore a rough spot in the middle of the drawing area so I fixed it by using a sheet of Highland Brand Transparency Film for Laser Printers -LRB- # 701 -RRB- , cut it to size and then scotch taped it to the tablet . It worked and the reason I have not updated to the Graphire 3 . This is also a good alternative to the plastic sheet Wacom sells on it 's site for $ 9.60 each . So you ask `` why am I putting up a review ? '' Because I want people to know this little 4X5 tablet will do as much as the more expensive Wacom Tablets . Whether you are an Artist or someone suffering the pain of using a mouse full time , this little tablet is well worth the money if you are on the computer as much as I AM . As to the man saying you have to hold your pen straight up and down , I do n't -- I hold it the same as any pen I use and it behaves the same way .

Excelent product . I 'm a freelance photographer and designer , and I 'm using the wacom tablet for image post production in photoshop and designing in Illustrator . Great tool . Did n't think I could live without it , until my dog ate it . Two of them , actually . The first came with the tablet itself , and the second my dog ate it just two weeks after I purchased it on AMazon . Thought it would be interestinf to share the story . Hope you enjoyed it as much as I did ... : p 	Tablet
I use an iPad , iPhone and Mac together as part of my production workflow . This writing instrument has a `` real feel '' that makes shifting between these devices even more natural than my fingertip . The various applications I use have difference levels of sensitivity to the angle , width and pressure of my fingertip that adds latency to tasks I need to be fluid -LRB- one example is highlighting text wherein the differences lead to have to repeatedly un-turn the page because I have n't used the touchscreen precisely enough - a serious distraction when I 'm busy -RRB- . The Boxwave stylus almost completely eliminates the latency and task-change learning curve between apps because it 's really easy to evolve precise consistent touch . It makes the work flow faster , the apps more responsive , keeps the screens on all the device cleaner and the icing on the cake is it feels even better than a pen on paper .

I love Wacom tablets ! You will never want to use a mouse again after you use one of these tablets . Although , this is a very good tablet the Intuos models are my favorite . 	Tablet
I ordered this product a year ago refurbished , and it 's still working as well as it did to this day . It feels like a dream when I 'm drawing on it , and I would definitely recommend it as a first-time tablet . I 'm certainly going to purchase from Wacom again when it 's time to upgrade tablets .

I didnt know much about these just after I bought this they became the big thing for Xmas , not easy to use , havent been able to read a book , watch a movie or delete a pic for that matter , try to delete it , keeps showing up . I think the way to work this thing is to download stuff to the card on a regular pc and hope it will open on this thing , plays music ok , half the apps are junk or dont work , old OS and slow processor make this a bad option , if you love working on gadgets and have all the time in the world I guess it could be useful , wish I 'd spent a bit more on a brand name one , or waited till I got an iphone .

I have 2 cases w \/ keyboards implemented in them for my iPad 2 . One is the Belkin which gets rave reviews and is nice . This item however is the one I am keeping . Why ? Because MOST of the time , I do n't want my iPad 2 in a case at all and this case can handle that . The Belkin wants your iPad to itself all the time , effectively turning it into a laptop . If I wanted a laptop , I 'd use my macbook . The New Trent Keyboard is really the best of both worlds - the case on the actual iPad is perfect : not too thin , not too thick and integrates very well into the keyboard side of this product , but allows for independent use perfectly . The keys are responsive and smaller than a full size keyboard , but still very useable . It also has multiple `` iPad '' specific keys which is great - allowing you to NOT be hitting the home button on the iPad every 2 seconds ... I will pick up several of these for Holiday gifts ...

I 've been using it for about 3 weeks , its seems no impact to my car or my IPAD and iPhone . : -RRB- so far so good . 	Tablet
I have used this stylus with my Toshiba Thrive and a Motorola Cliq . It works very well on the Thrive and is responsive and natural feeling . The only i had was in the corners and that was in the extreme corners . With the Cliq , it generally worked for selecting things , but not for dragging . Overall , it was a good purchase and I will likely buy one for my wife . 	Tablet
I received my iPad a couple days ago and absolutely love it ! It actually came a week earlier than the estimated delivery date which I was surprised because I was not expecting it yet . I had been doing my research on the tablets and the iPad but finally ended up choosing the iPad and It was definitely the right choice , and the battery life is a lot better than I thought a full charge can last me about 2-3 days upto 4 depending how much I use it .

This stylus is smaller and more precise than my finger , and keeps the screen cleaner . It also works with a touch screen mobile phone and easily distinguishes between a touch and a swipe . Best of all is when using Pages or Numbers on an iPad , as one can hit the small icons with ease . The hemispherical tip ensures contact over a wide range of angles so the stylus can be held as one would a regular pen . The stylus has a quality appearance with a chrome accent and a metal pocket clip . The top of the pen has a small hole through which a lanyard may be attached . It is only available in black , but that does not detract from its functionality . It is an excellent and inexpensive accessory for the iPad . Update : After six months of daily use , the rubber tip has perished and the stylus must be replaced . Its replacement will be a stylus with a longer lasting polymeric material and not one with soft rubber . 	Tablet

Be very afraid of spending $ 270 on this product . After only one month it died on me and has to be sent back in . To make matters worse , Nokia will not warranty it b\/c they claim it does not have a valid WLAN # , meaning that it was not meant for sale in the US ? WTF !? I live in Florida , and ordered it directly from Amazon , so I can not figure out how that happened ? Anyways , I am sending it back to Amazon for a replacement , who has so far said that they will exchange it . We will see what happens ... 	Tablet
I bought this tablet with the thoughts of trying to brick it . I was so satisfied with it right out of box I have n't even tried to mod it . I use the amazon app store , painless and couldnt be easier , I use the kindle software that came with it , could n't be easier to use . Within an hour of owning it , I had books , apps , games , music all on it . I used the included usb cable to hook this up to my laptop had music transferred onto with no issue . I even downloaded the opera browser , but the one on it was more than adequate . I am very satisfied with the purchase . 	Tablet

Oh my how great the feeling must have been when they finally got to release stuff directly from china . Without any pesky quality control folks breathing down their knock-off buts china production companies have flooded world markets with this garbage . It was cheap - I took a chance - whoops the pen developed a `` on again off again '' stutter . It worked fine for a while . I needed a replacement for my mouse and thought a pad like this might serve double duty as a drawing tool . Nah . It was cheap enough that I threw out the box and wrapping , oh well . Do n't buy this just spend the money and go get the one you want or need . This is a wind up plastic toy that sputters and falls over . It is a .25 cent time waster , an oddity in white . 	Tablet
First let me start off by saying I 've used every version of Android extensively and I know ways around faulty apps with free alternative apps in the marketplace . Please keep this in mind while reading this review . Also , I used a friend 's Archos 5 for 3 days before I bought my own Archos 5 8GB from Radioshack -LRB- The Shack ? -RRB- for $ -LRB- ... -RRB- I fully reconfigured and updated his device with Google apps support and Google sync . More on that below . Pros - beautiful build quality , beautiful screen , nice size that 's bigger than a smartphone but small enough to fit in a large pocket , Access to the entire Android Marketplace after enabling Google apps , Google apps support and Google Sync on the Archos after enabling them . SD card slot for easy storage upgrades Cons - Touch screen works but is n't as responsive as it should be , device can lag at times -LRB- but this is n't all that unusual with Android devices in general -RRB- Some apps did n't work as advertised . icons do n't always use space in the best way resulting in large gaps between icons For anyone that wants to truly see what the Archos 5 Android can do , they should install the Google apps after updating to the latest firmware . I understand this should not be necessary for a device such as this but under the circumstances , it 's highly recommended , only take a few minutes and is easy to do . The Android Marketplace alone gives the device so much extra firepower and flexibility that it can not and should not be ignored . GPS default app is n't working right ? Use Google Navigation . Ca n't get Pandora to run in the browser ? Use the free Android Pandora app . Hate the default Archos 5 browser ? Get Opera , Xscope or Dolphin browser in the Marketplace . It 's that simple . I will keep this as brief as possible . Archos did screw up big time by releasing a device that has potential but shipped flawed , buggy and gimp . I would n't be surprised if lawsuits are being prepared for false advertising considering some of the default apps do n't work . But despite this , I still liked the device because as I mentioned above , after installing the Google apps and marketplace , I was able to fully customize the Archos 5 Android to run like I needed it to run with the exception of the touchscreen . I did n't use Archos 's software to playback video . I used Astro , Xscope or the Android Gallery . I did n't use the default music player either . I used the default 1.6 Android player and `` 3 '' . I even switch the home launcher with DXtop and custom skins and icons . I tried to get the Archos to run similar to my Nexus One as best I could and the results were impressive . Also considering added storage through SD card is a welcome addition as well as the bluetooth tethering support . Speaking of which , I used the Bluetooth File Transfer app from the marketplace to transfer files from my Nexus One to the Archos 5 Android and it worked without any problems . That 's my constant theme for this review . If you are familiar with the Android Marketplace , you can find apps that function better than many of the default apps that ship with the Archos , It made my life less stressful for sure . Video playback is great , music playback is great even though the speaker is good but not the best I 've heard on a portable device . I had no stalls , freezes or crashes in the 3 days that I 've ran the Archos and I ran it pretty hard . The problems I did have all revolved around the touchscreen . Archos really should have known better and simply put a capacitive screen on the device . What 's the point in having a touchscreen if it is n't going to be as responsive as it should be ? Really . This was almost a deal breaker for me until I came to grips with it . It 's still not as good as my Nexus One , not by a long shot but it 's doable for the tablet . If lack of screen responsiveness can be addressed through software , then Archos should make that priority one . The stability issues are being dealt with as I just used the device with the latest firmware and it was very stable . But Archos should keep at it to ensure that the Archos 5 Android becomes a monster that will almost never fail . Summary , if you 're an experienced user of Android and can deal with a resistive touchscreen then I 'd say the Archos 5 may be for you . Android Marketplace will provide so many apps that will add so much functionality to the Archos , that is almost worth the price of admission alone . Audio and Video playback are great with Android apps , there are a number of good browsers to use for the web allowing you to download Youtube videos ... almost any video you find actually and run it direct from the unit . I had no problems with Wifi as I 'm running a Linksys WRT54G router . My only other gripe is that my PS3 will not recognize the Archos as a mass storage device . If you want overall ease of use without the hassles of constant firmware updates , if you want a more responsive touch screen and a `` it just works , out of the box '' experience , then buy Apple and never look back . I 'll update this review as I spend more time adding apps and files to the device to see if it holds up over longer periods of intense use . ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ UPDATE : 4-10-10 I 've spent the last few days really putting this device through it 's paces and I 've learned quite a bit . First and foremost , after calibrating the touchscreen , I can say that it 's definitely functional with finger use . No stlyus needed . But it 's not as good as a capacitive screen and rightfully so considering the Archos 5 Android has a resistive screen . With that in mind , I can navigate the Archos fine with my fingers and type fairly well on the virtual keyboard . Calibrating the screen is key and it very easy to do considering you 're prompted to calibrate the device on the first power on . Not sure why my friend did n't do this with his Archos 5 Android . The unit has been very stable as well and only crashed on me once when I had two browsers open , one having multiple tabs and trying to run video at the same time while running two other apps in the background . -LRB- I 'd like to see a 1GHz Archos 5 Android with 512mbs of DDR3 instead of the 128mbs that 's used now . -RRB- I 've thrown quite a few video formats at it , Xvid , Divx , Mp3 and Mp4 videos etc and they 've all worked with the exception of two that needed a codec that Archos offers for a price . That sucked and I passed on it . The only other format that I have to try is . FLV which I fully expect to not work but I 'll be happy to be proven wrong . Transferring files from my PS3 , Nexus One and PC to the Archos was very easy once I put a 16GB microSD card in the unit . The PS3 and PC would n't play nice with the Archos until then . The unit is very stable after installing the Android 1.6 update . But I decided to not put the Google Marketplace on my unit as the Archos Marketplace has quite a few apps in it and I realized without a constant internet connection , Google sync would n't be worth the install . Any apps I needed I just bluetooth pushed them from my Nexus One to the Archos using the free Bluetooth Transfer app in both marketplaces . Also , I was wrong about the video playback being better in Android apps as opposed to Archos 's own apps . I 've found that once you use a Android Launcher -LRB- Home Alternative app , DXtop , Open Home , Panda Home etc -RRB- on the Archos , you lose the Archos icons for music , video , photo playback that 's part of the Archo 's software that runs within Android . You need those apps and can have them on your desktop as widgets if you get them from the Archos marketplace under Multimedia . They 're free too . What this does is allows you to run Android apps as much as you want but also have the more robust Archos video app and the far superior codec support as customizable widgets without missing a beat . I did have problems with the playlist creation with the Archos music player . Although I like the layout of it once songs start to play . But at this time , it 's just easier for me to make playlists using the default Android app . The photo gallery is a matter of preference . Archo 's Gallery is superb and images look fantastic on the screen along with a larger sized thumbnails for easy viewing . The Android Gallery is good and images quality still looks great but the thumbnail view is n't as big and does n't look as slick especially after seeing the excellent Android 2.1 gallery . I believe that the Archos 5 Android tablet is a great device with some negatives that can be fixed with software updates and\/or revisions . I did n't buy the larger 500GB , 320GB or other sizes because I wanted the slimmer form factor of the 8GB version . It offers a lot of flexibility and power for such a small device and is n't sold at a premium . Having the ability to run Android . apk files regardless of the lack of Google Marketplace support means users can still get access to the huge catalog of Android apps available and run them on their devices . If potential buyers are already running Android smartphones then they 're ahead of the curve . It could benefit from more RAM in future versions as the device lag at times but the lag was no where near as bad as some people have made it out to be . It 's not G1 or Mytouch 3G bad where the device locks up for minutes at a time . If Google would n't make this a `` Google Experience '' device then they must have something truly special in the pipeline but as it stands , even at a much cheaper price for the 8GB version , Archos 5 Android does quite a few things that a Ipad can not . 4-20-10 UPDATE This will be my final update for the Archos5 Android as I 've put it through it 's paces pretty good since I 've started using it . I found out that the device will play flash movie files -LRB- . flv files -RRB- native without having to encode the video for playback in a different format . A Archos rep recommended saving videos to the archos one by one as opposed to bulk saving because bulk saves can damage the files en route . I bulk transferred a number of . flv files and all were corrupted but I can confirm that doing as the archos rep suggested works . I decided to put the Google Experience apps on my Archos because , quite simply , the process is so ridiculously easy and fast there was no reason not to . This device has great potential but there are still some things that could have been better . Battery life . The Archos 5 Android 's battery drains incredibly fast while playing media . I 'm not sure which battery is used but a higher capacity battery than the one present would have been a godsend . I can use the resistive screen for a good experience but a capacitive screen would have made navigating the Archos 5 Android a great experience . The device needs more RAM . Period . Overall stability . I 'm a geek at heart and tooling around with the Archos is great fun for me . I 've loved it because I know how to get around or solve some of the problems other users are having . But the average consumer is n't going to be as patient or even as tech savvy enough to do the same . The initial bugs with the Archos simply should not be . Yes , firmware updates have solved stability issues and bugs in some key areas but the reality is , when you 're asked to pay hundreds of dollars for a device , it should just work . Period . With that being said , I stand by my 4 \* review . The Archos 5 Android shows what a internet tablet should be -LRB- when the full range of Google services added -RRB- even if it 's currently geared towards the power user -LRB- Android\/Linux power user really -RRB- as opposed to Joe Everyday . -1 \* for the need to update as soon as you take it out of the box .

My 8 yr old son loves to draw and this saves a lot of paper -LRB- and ink marks in the car -RRB- . Discovered he can also trace over pictures . He has used it for over 2 months so it is at least somewhat durable . No one in the family can resist picking it up and drawing or leaving a note for others to find . Could n't give it 5 stars because I think the price should be closer to $ 20-25 , but as long as people pay $ 34 the price is not going to come down . 	Tablet
The Graphire4 works reasonably well for most of my amateur artwork needs . I had some difficulty getting accustomed to having to keep the pen so close to the tablet surface of the tablet so it would n't lost track of it . Other than that this wonderful little peripheral works well with my Windows machine and my Linux machine . 	Tablet
I bought the keyboard dock for our Lenovo K1 tablet along with a case . The keyboard dock works well when I do n't feel like using the tablets touchpad and comes in handy for charging . 	Tablet
Its very easy to use , nothing fancy but right for the price . It is vey easy to install and use even if you have to train a bit before you can use the pen with ease . I do enjoy it though and am very happy I bought it ! 	Tablet
i bought this to carry my nook . it swallows it compared to the nook size . instead i use it as my camera bag carrying my digital and video camera and all the cords that go with them . bad choice for nook , and great for a versital camera bag 	Tablet
This is a really good `` cheap '' tablet . It was easy to install android market on it . Archos does a really good job keeping the system updated . Since I got it in in June they have releases two firmware upgrades . Flash works great in the browser . Very loud speakers for a tablet ! I really recommend it . 	Tablet
This was given as a Christmas gift , and has not been used yet . I can not review it until I speak to the recipient of the gift . 	Tablet
5th review 7\/5\/12 ... I use my Xoom every single day . Last Christmas I put a motorola wireless keyboard and wireless logitech mouse -LRB- to be used together -RRB- on my Amazon wish list and received both of them for Christmas . I did not use them -LRB- actually kept forgetting I had them -RRB- until last week -LRB- 7\/1\/12 -RRB- . Stupid me ! These are the greatest accessories to compliment your Xoom . I find that using a real keyboard is a must have\/helpful in some situations and wanted to try it out . It did n't disappoint . Using the keyboard when on facebook or typing a lengthy email is a great asset . It also came in handy while trying to choose some actions where your fingers just wo n't work on the first try . Using a tablet is great , but sometimes we wish we had a real keyboard and this is the perfect accessory for this tablet . So sometimes I have a tablet and sometimes it seems like I have a laptop . Either way ... I love this accessory and it works like a charm . The mouse and\/or your finger works without having to switch anything over . Just turn on the keyboard -LRB- or not -RRB- and the mouse -LRB- or not -RRB- . The beauty of all this , it all fits in my purse : -RRB- 4th review 6\/2\/11 ... had another weird situation this time with my magazine\/book subscriptions but before you think it was the Xoom ... it was n't . This time it was my fault ... stupid , stupid , stupid move on my part . Going through my Xoom and exploring some apps that I had not previously explored and I came across `` Gallery '' full of my photos and many many magazine\/book photos and artwork and magazine\/book covers tons of them so I figured why do I need all this taking up my memory\/storage space so I start to delete and delete and delete them , of course I thought maybe these needed to be there so I did a little test and the mags were still there that I had deleted ... OF COURSE THEY WERE !! but with no artwork\/photos left in them . Arrggghhhh !! What have I done ?! So after a hour of trying to figure the whole thing out I gave my Xoom to my gadget savvy husband and asked him to work on it . After about 15 minutes he called Barnes and Noble and had a service tech help him out . After a few tweaks they were able to redownload all my books\/magazines and everything is back to normal . So the reason for this embarrassing review is to let you\/anyone know to NOT just start deleting stuff from your Xoom unless you are certain you are NOT deleting important very much needed data ... dummy I am : -RRB- 3rd review -LRB- 5\/10\/11 -RRB- ... had a bump in the road with my new Xoom : -LRB- It locked up on me during the Honeycomb startup , have no idea why but there was nothing I could do and the Motorola -LRB- help desk -RRB- could not help . So after the disappointment and the wonderful support from Amazon -LRB- sending me a brand new one , it was still under the 60 warranty\/return policy -RRB- I got over my disappointment because I love this product even though my first one hit a bump in the road . While setting up my replacement I also learned some new things and lost ONLY the photos\/videos I had taken with the Xoom -LRB- I never did save anything to my PC , so that 's my fault -RRB- . I was able to retrieve everything else -LRB- all apps , etc -RRB- . The more I use it , the more I truly believe I made the right decision on purchasing this product . Thank you Amazon for the quick response on my replacement -LRB- by the way -RRB- no questions asked . Sorry I had to mention the start up issue , just in case others come across this . In reality things happen and you can even purchase a $ 80,000 car and it could be a lemon ... so hopefully there will be no more issues with my new Xoom . 2nd review -LRB- April 2011 -RRB- ... after using the Xoom for about three weeks now . Very very impressed ... the other day I sad down to use my Xoom and did n't know what to do first . There 's so much to do and soooo many things to learn . This just happened to me this evening and I had to update my original review because of it . When I first received my Xoom I went into my email account -LRB- through Comcast -RRB- and the website just would n't load right and there was flashing of articles and other stuff -LRB- videos -RRB- and disappointed I left that website and mentioned to my husband that it would not load right ... right away he said nooooo let me have your emails forwarded to your gmail account -LRB- which is used when you first use your Xoom -RRB- . A bit disappointing that I could n't use my normal email screen , but whatever I let it go . Been using the gmail email only when using my Xoom . BUT tonight I was updating my Xoom with my favorite bookmarks and low and behold I went into my original Comcast email just to see what would happen ... WOW it adapted to my Comcast account I can access ALL my emails , folders , address book and more without the ads and crap that tainted my view the first time ... I was so impressed I just had to mention it . Adapting ... how spooky and impressive at the same time 1st review -LRB- March -RRB- : I 'm not a techy , a young adult or a `` gotta have that '' type of person , just a housewife , a working mom of two children and in my 40 's with that said , here 's my review : I have not used a Ipad of any kind or Android product ... but do know many many people who have , all around me everyday and because of that and reading many reviews I went with the Xoom WiFi only . What a great decision I 've made . This product is quality throughout . Love how fast and accurate each move is and I 've impressed the Ipad\/Adroid -LRB- cell phone users -RRB- with my Xoom . Brought it to work this week and did n't see it for hours . Comments from my co-workers : `` Boy this is fast '' , `` Look how sharp the screen looks '' , `` This is really nice '' , `` Oh , you gotta have Adobe Flash '' , `` This feels like really nice quality '' . My decision to buy the Xoom over Ipad -LRB- which I came really close to buying -RRB- was because of the following : Quality Adobe flash Honeycomb technology Product can be updated in your own living room -LRB- as updates come along -RRB- Can do just about everything a laptop can do , just smaller Ca n't wait to see : Netflix apps Apps to allow printing -LRB- probably out there , but not sure yet -RRB- What new updates will come along What new games will come along What new accessories -LRB- ex : covers , cases , bags to help protect my Xoom -RRB- Favorite things about my Xoom : Size How fast it is Automatic updates on current saved apps Transferring my current personal email to the Gmail Xoom account automatically The coolest apps : Disaster Alerts -LRB- around the world , Scanner -LRB- police , fire , emergency around the US -RRB- , Radio app to listen to your favorite stations without actually going into each website , and many more . The built in camera\/video player . Sharp and awesome . Screen size , better than viewing on a cell phone any day . As new technology goes ... Hi Xoom ... whatever Ipad : -RRB- 	Tablet
Not being a techno-whiz , I need all the cue cards I can get . No cue cards w \/ the iPad -LRB- original -RRB- . No instruction book . Even w \/ tutorials , lots of info re how to download -LRB- $ -RRB- , but no basics like how to access and play the music you have downloaded . Took LOTS of trial and error to figure out . On the up side , having a store nearby to take 1:1 classes is wonderful , and will learn much in short order . One other concern , I downloaded Sketchbook Pro to learn to draw in the computer . Present iPad technology requires a stylus pen w \/ an eraser tip for iPad to `` read '' the marks you make . Any way to make a different type of interface sensitivity -LRB- pressure vs electrical charge of skin -RRB- to enable a finer tip as needed ? Yes , one can choose tips and brushes , but requiring so much surface of the eraser tip to create a line seems inefficient . Perhaps a wacom tablet would have been a better choice . Overall , it is amazing to have music , mail , drawing , search , calendar etc in such a small package . The problems ... no doubt more my abilities than the product . 	Tablet
I charged the battery fully and attempted to use with my IPAD and when that would n't work , my phone . The battery will only power up for about 10 to 15 seconds before it shuts down even though it is fully charged . Other reviewers here are having the same problem , so I sent it back and ordered the Hypermac , which I recommend . 	Tablet
I got my Thrive 2 days before it was officiay released . I love this thing . I had to call tech support for a lock up caused by an app . Yes the guy was in India , but he actually spoke very good English . He walked me through what I needed to do , and did not treat me like an idiot . I have to say this is the best tech support I have ever had . And I have talked to half of India . 	Tablet
I bought this product a little over a month ago . I would have rated it a 4 star because it really is very useful ... when it works . About a week ago mine stopped booting up . I 've tried calling the company and emailing them , all to no avail . My support ticket was answered three days later by saying I should call them . Good luck with that . After 16 minutes on hold your call goes to voice-mail . I should say void mail because I have yet to ever hear back from anybody . I now own an expensive paper-weight . 	Tablet
This thing was exactly what I needed . I was working from home while recovering from surgery , and could easily work from bed or from the couch without having a heavy , hot laptop sitting on my lap . It can be used in many different configurations so it 's very versatile in terms of height , angle , etc. . It is lightweight but sturdy enough for what it needs to do . It is certainly a handy thing to have around , even if you 're not recovering from surgery . I anticipate getting a lot of use out of it and I definitely recommend it . 	Tablet
Very nice for games , social networking , etc. . Of little use for serious business use . Very unituitive and without instructions . The one book I bought on ipad was of little use . 	Tablet
I was looking for a stylus for my iPad for taking notes and commenting on document files . My finger was not working well because the mark I made with it was difficult to position with any accuracy . It would make a mark at one side of my finger and next time at another , so it was hard to circle words or make proof reader marks , etc. . I had tried a different pen that was even worse than using my finger . It was hard to accurately position the mark and it rarely made a mark . It was like trying to write with a pen that was mostly out of ink . I did n't want to waste another $ 25 or so on another unuseful pen . This Targus stylus was cheap enough to take a chance on . Delivery was much faster than the estimate with my order . It works well . I can position the marks it makes pretty accurately on the iPad . It has a very blunt tip , so you ca n't position it visually very well , but the mark is very close to where I expect a pen to make a mark , so hand-eye coordination takes over and lets me position marks and comments well . So I am very happy with its performance . The iPad or it 's apps does limit how small a mark you can make , so you do have to exaggerate dots or periods , etc. . The stylus is shorter and skinnier than nearly all pens and pencils , so it is awkward and uncomfortable to use for a long time . The clip on the side is just pressed in and very poor quality . It bends and falls off easily so I carry the stylus in a bag with the cables , charger , etc. for the iPad rather than in my shirt pocket or clipped to the iPad . Even so , it has a good cost\/performance point at the sale price I paid . 	Tablet
Works great . . got two , one for each car , plug in about any thing that accepts a USB cable . bought the first one and my wife took it as soon as I got it out of the bag , lol , soon I had to order another one 	Tablet
I am in Afghanistan working and my wife skypes our son 's sports to me with the ipad and she loves it . Thank you ! My kids love playing with it and it is portable more so than a laptop we set up hotspot with iphone and instant internet . 	Tablet
The carbon fiber film took some time to place with a few restart . I did no use a blow dryer as instructed for the carbon fiber and it still sticks good . It gave it a good look and made it easier to handle\/grip . I 'm not afraid to lay it down now on the table in fear of scratching the back . It was easy to place the sceen protection on with the spray . After about 24 hrs all the micro bubbles went away . The screen protection seem to make it easier to read and less finger print issues . No sign of peeling as of yet -LRB- 1 week since application -RRB- . I would buy again . I may by one for my Droid X. 	Tablet
Well what can I say , just plain awesome and you got to try it . It comes with a bunch of free apps and games . Perfect for travel , school , work -RRB- . -LRB- good things come in small packages ! 	Tablet
Product works wonderfully , I purchased as a gift , and it arrived in beautiful condition and on time . 	Tablet
There are many things to praise regarding the new Sony S tablet . The design is modern , not so thin in some areas , but the shape of the tablet makes it unique . Also , very easy to hold . The screen is gorgeous , and very responsive . Text is crisp and pinch\/zooming works great . The biggest flaws of the Sony tablet are the limited funtionality of the sd card . The data stored on the sd card has to be transferred to the tablet 's interal memory before usable . Which does suck if you intended to pack a 32GB SD card , loaded with media in it . Fortunately I was able to find many apps in the Google store that allowed me to play music and movies directly from the SD card , as it should be . Honeycomb never looked so good on a tablet , even beating Samsungs 10 '' tablet . The plastic shell might ot appeal to some , but it seems pretty scratch resistant , and keeps the tablet light . Would say that currently the 32GB , soon to come wi-fi 3g model may be the best Android tablet for a while . 	Tablet
Ok ladies and gentlemen - so I toiled for hours over what case to buy for my beautiful Sony S Android Tablet - and after much deliberation -LRB- as there are a million choices out there -RRB- I have to say I ca n't imagine being any happier with any other case out there for my tablet then this wonderful case !!! So here 's the list of Pro 's : Fits snugly and cleanly EVERY CUT OUT FOR EVERY FEATURE of the Sony Tablet IS PERFECTLY PLACED !!! Yes - the IR Blaster , the Charging Port , the USB\/SD Card Access , the Power & Volume buttons , the Light Sensor & BOTH the Cameras - ALL PERFECT - even the strap which comes with the tablet is full functional and works great to pull the unit out of the sleeve , like I do when I get home and want to dock it in the sony stand by the entertainment system ... The material is really very nice - actually nice does n't quite cover it - it 's awesome - looks sexy and feels great in your hand -LRB- s -RRB- - no it 's not real leather , it 's some kind of polyurethane like material but it does n't feel plastic-like - it almost feels like leather but has a criss-cross like tight style almost grain to it - which adds to it both looks wise and grip wise - I 've had it for a week or two now and I really like how it 's made . It is well stitched around the edges and very clean . It uses two small magnets in the top two corners of the case to keep the cover on - and I gotta say - they work pretty well - certainly no complaints - and to those who say it messes with the built in compass - umm - does n't seem to for me and i use it like that with Google Nav as well as an actual compass when I 'm checking ruff orientation of antennas on cell towers ... Every edge is well covered and when I dropped it the other day i was n't even nervous about it for that very reason - no exposed edges to worry about ... the multi-position cover doubles to give you two different viewing angles and folds all the way back like a magazine -LRB- actually better then a magazine -RRB- if you want to \/ like to use it as an E-Reader ... Best part is that it 's the least bulky case I found - yet offers all the protection you could want -LRB- well short of water proofing the tablet - hey , you ca n't have everything , right ? -RRB- So , if you are in doubt - just buy this case - for 20 - bux you just simply ca n't go wrong -LRB- if i was choosing between this and another case - even if there was a cheaper option or this was a little more - i 'd still go with this one - too bad they do n't sell it in brick and mortar stores - more people would buy it - the other cases are all just over-rated and frankly I think this one is under-rated ... Hell , I even considered getting a 2nd one incase i destroy this one at some point in the future just for fear that anything this good usually gets replaced in the market buy something of lesser quality , function and usually costs more to boot ... - though I ca n't imagine how you could mess it up ... Ok , hope I convinced you - now click BUY NOW !!! and throw it in your cart ! Regards , ~ Chris 	Tablet
Works well and is pretty sturdy . Only concern I have is when the case is in typing position the front flap does n't stay locked in as well as when it is in the viewing position . It 's only a minor inconvenience . 	Tablet
I bought one of these , although the name was `` Lap Dog '' and it is FREAKIN USELESSS !!!!!!! it NEVER STAYS UP and is like a CHINESE PUZZLE -- impossible to line up the legs appropriately so that you can balance stuff on it ... wrote the company to return it , and they never responded -- went in my Junk\/Goodwill pile what a WASTE OF $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ !

I absolutely love these speakers . They make my music sound absolutely amazing . A perfect mixture of all sound frequencies . They have an appealing look and super easy to hook up ! No instructions needed . I spent $ 50 on them and it was worth every penny . The satellite speakers sound good even when you are n't sitting right in front of them . It fills a large area with amazing sound . And it has a three year warranty ! I have been using them mostly with my MacBook Pro . 	Tablet
This item is under recall by Viewsonic . Flash does not work , the multitap display is for crap . It will be revamped and re-released JAN-FEB 2011 	Tablet
"I found this cover by accident . I had just bought a Nook Color and took a free course at Barnes and Noble . I sat next to a woman who had this cover and I loved the way it sat up for reading . I returned the one I bought from Barnes and Noble and bought the Roo from Amazon . It was actually cheaper than the one I returned ! I was surprised that a cover not sold by Barnes and Noble would fit my Nook Color , but it does and it holds its shape ! I am very satisfied ... <ahref=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004GIKP1G/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/179-6400879-2047121""> rooCASE Multi-View -LRB- Black -RRB- Leather Case Cover with 22 Angle Adjustable Stand for Barnes and Noble NOOKcolor Nook Color eBook Reader </a> "	Tablet
This is the first tablet I have used but the precision you get from the pen is great . It also came with some nice FREE software . 	Tablet
These were great while they worked . I used them to connect to my PC for VoIP apps , and connect to my android mobile . Last month the bluetooth just stopped connecting to both the PC and Android app . I would not buy them again . 	Tablet
This tablet has a nice , solid feel . The screen looks great -- better than my notebook . It does what I need -- check e-mail , read documents , and browse the web . Why not 5 stars ? 1 . I purchased a USB keyboard and case , which did not work . After much surfing , I found out that the T408 does not support a USB keyboard . It would be nice to have the documentation explain the limited USB functionality . It is basically just for syncing or downloading to the SD card . 2 . I had to load a $ 4.99 app to play video , including flash . There is very limited video support that comes with it . It was a steal for $ 99 . 	Tablet
If you are expecting this tablet to perform the same way a $ 600 tablet performs , you wont like this tablet at all . It does take longer to perform certain functions , but for how much I spent on it , thats to be expected . It does not have a camera either . Live wallpapers will slow it down , and drain the battery much quicker , so sometimes I use one , but most of the time I dont . I like this tablet alot , it 's not as nice as my fiance 's nook tablet , but it was also half the cost . I was able to put the android market place on it , all you have to do is go on youtube for directions , and theres plenty of videos on there to help you ... it is NOT hard to figure out . The tablet comes with Getjar , which has some nice apps on there as well . Anyway , over all I think this is a nice tablet for the price , and on the up side , I dont have to worry about letting my 8 year old son use it , the way I 'd worry about him using a more expensive tablet .

I LOVE IT ! I AM ABLE TO WEAR IT AND ACTUALLY IT IS SO SMALL I FORGET I AM WEARING IT ! THE CLARITY IS GREAT , IT IS EASY TO USE AND THE EAR PIECE IS COMFY ... I LOVE IT ! CHEERS TO AMAZON FOR THE SPEEDY SERVICE , I WAS N'T EXPECTING IT FOR ANOTHER WEEK AND A HALF . GOT IT IN JUST A FEW DAYS !! WOW ! 	Telephone
Bought this product after lisenting to one a friend had . I bought it and have n't regretted purchasing it . I ride a commuter train every day so you can imagine the noise while your trying to listen to music . It 's not just the train noise it 's also the people around you with cell phones loud talking etc. . I turn on the noise cancellation feature and magic happens . I do n't hear anything except the music and the quality of the sound under those conditions is outstanding . Even if you do n't travel you can use it at home the noise cancellation feature works like 3D for music . Just a warning though if you are expecting a call or the door bell rings you 'll never hear it . 	Telephone
These are great headphones . You wo n't find a better deal for less than 20 dollars . I mainly use them for listening to music and watching shows over the internet and they are great for both of those . The volume is acceptable and they are comfortable enough for wear for extended hours . I 'm not audiophile , but I find these to be very nice for your average user . Only downside is possibly the long cord since , though that 's really a plus since they are comfortably be used from pretty far away . ETA : Mine eventually broke -LRB- my fault for sitting on them -RRB- and I bought a new pair . Still enjoy them a lot ! 	Telephone
Terrible service , Terrible phones . DO NOT GET anything PANASONIC . Called support and was transfered around the world before they said they would call me back , They DID NOT . Purchased another phone and they worked on first try . 	Telephone
Picks up sound good but when its plugged in the ipod\/iphone reads it as headphones . Overall very good product for anyone . 	Telephone
I also have have a Rio Volt 100 , on seeing the low price for the SL-SX420 I thought I 'd pick up a spare player . In comparison to the Rio Volt : <p> CONS : No ID3 display lower volume resumes from the start of track , not the exact spot no forward or reverse scan within the track no firmware updates possible <p> PRO : very light smaller and thinner than the Rio Volt very good battery life easy to use remote <p> I probably should have gotten the iRiver ChromeX , which is the successor to the no-longer-manufactured Rio Volt , but I wanted to try something different and this was less expensive . The SL-SX420 is lacking features I 've gotten used to on the Volt , but being smaller , lighter and having longer battery life makes up for that somewhat . Now , I know I could have gotten one of the more expensive iRiver models and could have had everything , features and small size , in one player , but I wanted to stay with standard AA batteries instead of the flat rechargables that iRiver uses in their top-of-the-line players .

These small headphones have a great sound . Plenty of solid deep bass and clear highs . You would think you were wear a pair of over the ear headphones . 	Telephone
They are great Headphones for $ 3.00 stop whining , what do you expect fro $ 3.00 , none of this style of headphone , at least in my opinion is comfortable , and none of this style of headphone is going to block the noise , you need a haedphone that covers your entire ear to block noise . If you need a cheap pair of earbuds buy these , they have a LIFETIME Warranty from the manufacturer , find another headphone that has a LIFETIME Warranty . Especially on a $ 3.00 pair of headphones . 	Telephone
This product is excellent . Works flawlessly . When I get in the car , I hold down the button til it turns blue and whatever I was just listening to on my iPhone jumps to my car speakers and I continue on my way . Does n't get any simpler or easier . The sound quality is great and with this product being relatively inexpensive I will be sure to buy more in the future . 	Telephone
Sleek , cute & sexy , blah , blah , blah ... $ 20 + for a remote , what basically does NOTHING ?! C'mon you guys ! If you 're a Mac fan , I have a strong feeling , that you 've already owned at least an iTouch or iPhone . Please , save your money ! It works great with FrontRow , QuickTime Media Player , iTunes , iPhoto and ... nothing else , sorry dudes , it also adjusts the volume on your Mac !!! Great achievement Apple ! Screw that ! Get an AirMouse Pro or Logitech TouchMouse -LRB- under $ 3 -RRB- on your i. . . thingy !!! Those apps do WAAYYY much more than that overpriced remote controller !!! 	Telephone
I bought these headphones around a year ago , and have been using them ever since . While I 'm fairly impressed with the sound quality , and think the noise isolation is great , the quality of construction is a bit worrisome : The rubber cable covering is n't particularly strong . I got these caught on a door handle as I walked past , and while I should have been more careful , the rubber was easily yanked back , and the cord is only intact with the assistance of electrical tape and superglue . In addition , the earbuds themselves are n't particularly durable . One of the earstems -LRB- which I use to twist the earbuds in -RRB- came loose , and has since come loose several more times even after I superglued it back . Also , if you can see on the picture , the black part has come apart from the silver part on both sides , exposing the inner workings , and I have had to resort to superglue once again . Finally , the rubber inserts come off very easily . After losing a medium and then losing a large -LRB- I switched to the large ones after I lost a medium -RRB- , I was forced to buy some generic inserts , and they fit even worse ! I once again superglued them on , which seems to work well and , surprisingly , does n't affect the sound quality . I bought these headphones based on glowing sound reviews , and have no complaints in that area . If you are a very gentle user then these would probably work well for you , but if you listen to them while you work out or something , I 'd recommend finding some more durable headphones . 	Telephone
The product meets all my needs . However , I did n't take particular notice of the super bass feature of these headphones . It turned out not to be such a problem since I simply switched my iPod 's EQ to `` Treble Boost . '' I 'm sure most every MP3 player today has some sort of sound modification feature to increase or decrease bass , treble or some such thing . However , if your MP3 player does not have something like that expect to hear a fair amount of bass . 	Telephone
These did n't last 18 months ; the right bud is dead . I should be thankful , since I never like them at all and have reason to get anything else . 	Telephone
This is my FAVORITE pair of headphones . I have bought and tried many headphones ... . but nothing ... . nothing ... could compare 2 these . These have excellent bass and EXCELLENT highs . They have an EXCELLENT frequency range.....14hz-24Khz . They have the capacity of holdin 1 WATT -LRB- 1,000 miliwatts -RRB- ! Most powered speakers for cd players dont have that much handling capabilities . These have sound clarity that is uncomparable . They have 30mm drivers . which mean low bass and high highs . They also have excellent sound distribution . they have a silent cap . Also these things are THE best looking . They are PIMP . U can change its colors 2 match ur shirt . These are a lot better than the clip on sony headphones . They are very comfortable and u can be standing upside down and these things wouldnt fall of . Also these things have only 1 cord and it rarely gets tangled . Believ me this is a great buy ... 	Telephone
I usually use Klipsch in-ear headphones , and have had several different active noise canceling on the ear sets from Sony , Audio-Technica , etc. . However I wanted an over the ear set for at home both for comfort and for passive noise cancellation so as to not take away from the music . Also I recently got a new keyboard and do n't want to bother the rest of the house with my playing . These were quite a bit less than the Klipsch on-ear passive Reference One 's , so I gave them a try . I was pleasantly surprised and completely satisfied with my decision . I was n't necessarily looking for bling but they look pretty cool and have a great carrying case as well . You wo n't regret buying these !! 	Telephone
They stay in your ear and do n't have vibration feedback . Also the end tips are connected so they wo n't fall off like other in-ear plug type headphones . Highly regarded ! 	Telephone
I bought these at the same time as my Riovolt MP3 CD player based nearly on the reputation of Sennheiser alone . I did n't expect much from the included pair of in-ear 's and was content with the Sennheiser MX-300 's . I got a decent replacement , but there are SO many more good and inexpensive alternatives now , like the MX400\/500 for under $ 20 . Considering the price and it 's functional purpose -LRB- portable -RRB- , they were a good deal at the time . There can get pretty uncomfortable for listening over an hour however and bass is relatively weak . 	Telephone
Simply stated , this is the best Dect 6 phone out there ! I purchased a GE Dect 6 when it first came out and was so disappointed . Call quality -LRB- esp on speakerphone -RRB- was HORRIBLE . So then I got a set of Uniden from my local Target store ... those got returned the same day . Call quality was choppy and they kept saying `` Lost Connection with Base '' or something like that when I was right by the base . After reading several great reviews on this phone at Amazon , I decided to purchase and am SOOOO happy with my purchase . These phones are great ... highly recommended !! 	Telephone
We have this system ... we 've had it for about 3 years . Added on to it too . The truth is it just has n't held up very well . My husband uses the 2 line in his office . We 've never used the answering machine part -LRB- so this is not commenting on that -RRB- . The desk unit has long ago begun to put out miserable sound unless using the speaker . And even on the speaker phone , the sound to the `` callee '' is poor and intermittently worse than poor . Now , even on the cordless handsets folks do n't hear us well -LRB- could be batteries BUT this is on the newer and older units -RRB- . Do you recall the term ` planned obsolescence ' ? This is it incarnate . Not a worthwhile buy ... NOW we have to try another entire set . I was going to buy the replacement desk unit , but overall , it 's not worth the chance . What ever happened to the OLD AT&T whose products would kick-butt the competition ?! 	Telephone
I bought these headphones a couple of months ago and when the left driver started acting funny I sent the pair back . Two weeks -LRB- ! -RRB- later I received a package containing the left earphone from an SE425 , the right from an SE535 , and a less robust looking cord from some other model . I sent them all back and am now closing in on four weeks without headphones . Despite the awesome sound -LRB- particularly around the midrange -RRB- , I can help but give these earbuds two stars due to the sheer incompetence of Shure 's service department . 	Telephone
Works GREAT , plus the price is even better . Really happy with quality of Sennheiser RS120 926 MHz Wireless RF Headphones with Charging Cradle . 	Telephone
I bought these for the gym just to have an extra set . The regular iphone type just do n't stay in my ears . I have a pair of Skull Candy ones that sound great but did not have the microphone or control buttons . Well these sound amazing . I listen to a range of music including techno , rock , and Alt . The buds really stay in my ears well and block out a lot of noise . However , the product DID NOT come with the case as described in the description and shown in the pictures . 	Telephone
This item is a mini-speaker system for an ipod or iphone . I 've had some of these in the past they 're all pretty great , compared to the speakers of yesteryear . This particular one plays and charges your phone or ipod . The sound is very good , to these untrained ears , and it produces enough volume to use it with a group of 30 high school and middle school girls in a large gymnasium . There was enough sound that it was easily heard over the typical teenager noises and giggling . I have n't tried it in a bigger setting or with a larger crowd . It does n't compare with , say , a Bose speaker , but for purposes of home listening , volleyball camp line dancing and general use , I highly recommend this little gadget . It makes the most of my ipod and it looks good sitting on the table . 	Telephone
These headphones are n't THAT hard to put on ... I think people are just angry too often . They can be uncomfortable or not depending on the shape of your ear or the cover you use , it just depends . The problem is the sound . It 's not for everyone ; it totally depends on if you prefer more bass or more treble . Personally I prefer more treble over more bass because if there 's too much bass it sounds muddy , so these are okay for me . These have little bass BUT at least it 's a little better for your hearing ... 	Telephone
Headset is awsome . Sound quality is great , fit great , and the abilty to charge them on the stand without having to hook up and disconnect cables everytime you want to charge them is a great design . 	Telephone
I bought these as a gift for my gamer boyfriend . This is his favorite brand so I was super excited to find them on here at such a reasonable price . So , they work fine , and are very comfortable , I 've tried them . = -RRB- Also , they look really cool . 	Telephone
It 's like having new phones with these batteries , have n't heard the dreaded low battery beep since I bought these a over a month ago and I forget to put the phones on chargers all the time . 	Telephone
I had a similar set of clips for several years , but the cord was directed up and over the ear in a channel in the clip . Also the clip was a much harder plastic . Luckily , I lost it . The design for these clips is ideal . The earbuds clip securely into the holders with the cord dangling down locating the control switches and microphone where they should be . The soft material in the clips permits me to wear the clips for extended periods of time . This product has one other distinction : the longest name for a product under $ 10 . 	Telephone
I 've had mine for over 3 years - 3 year of almost constant abuse at the gym , playing games , etc. . Very , very durable . I was very happy with the sound as well . These headphones have one of the best performance\/price ratios I 've seen . 	Telephone
I have been wanting to switch to wireless headphones for a long time , mostly because of the fact that I always get wrapped up in the cords or my pets mess with the cord . I was skeptical to switch because of quality and price . However , after reading a lot of reviews , I decided to try these out . I am pleased with them so far . They have great range with little to no loss of quality in and around my house . The ONLY real negative thing I have seen -LRB- heard rather -RRB- is the Automatic Gain Control which to my knowledge , ca n't be turned off . If you listen to music with sudden changes , such as movie soundtracks or classical , every time you get a sudden noise , such as drums , cymbal , etc , the Automatic Gain Control lowers to volume to compensate for the sudden increase in volume , or so it thinks . This can make your music somewhat inconsistent , which can be annoying . I would imagine with more constant sounding music , it would be a non-issue though . That being said , I am still happy with my purchase , and would recommend them to someone looking to get away from a corded set . 	Telephone
Installation could not have been easier . All features are as stated . I was dissapointed with the I.R camera performance . I purchased it for trying to catch someone sneaking into my home . I thought the Motion Sensor settings would do the trick . They do capture most motion relitively well . I did have to play around with the sensitivity a few times to eliminate false motion . The problem that almost renders this system useless for me is it 's unfriendly interface when attempting to review the motion triggered events . It takes 4 to 5 steps to review each event . It freezes about 50 % of the time requiring another 5 steps . On average it takes about 10 minutes to reveiw a few events because of it 's setup . I was also disapointed with the customer care I received . The unit randomely advances 12 hours maybe every week or two . When I contacted customer service they told me to send it back so they could bench test it . They would not send me a replacement . This unit is less then 30 days old ! I could n't return the whole unit because all the wires were fished through my walls etc. . Overall I 'm just so-so on the unit . 	Telephone
i have had this for 4 months now . What i can say is it did n't disappointed me . I bought this to replace me sony isolating earbud , the difference was like night and day . After the first 2 weeks of use on my laptop , the sound is not much different than my first use , flat and average . Then i decided to listen to it on my nakamichi receiver , right away , the sound all the sudden became richer and clearer , and much more dynamic . After that i almost use it everyday , the sound is so pleasant to listen to . I think my high current receiver opens up the sound , otherwise you would probably need longer time to break in . I had Grado 60 , and sold it cuz of discomfort . The HD-497 is a bit uncomfortable after an hour of use . Any way between Grado 60 and HD-497 , i would chose HD-497 over Grado 60 , the reason is that HD-497 has more bass then Grado 60 . And because of the bass the sounds are much more dynamic and rich . I give it 4 star because it hurts my ear a bit . 	Telephone
I purchased these headphones because they looked very stylish and that I liked that there were two audio jacks for you to share your audio with a friend or so . The sound quality and bass were so-so , but then again if you 're looking to buy Beats the only thing you 're probably concerned with is the way they look . And if you are that person , these headphones will probably suit you well . I 'm willing to look past the audio quality on these headphones but the deal breaker was the comfort . These headphones were terribly uncomfortable , after 20 minutes of wearing these your head and ear will start hurting . And if they do n't then you must have a small head . You could try stretching these out so there wo n't be as much pressure against your head and I had tried to stretch them by leaving them open on my shoe box for 2 days , but nothing helped .

The camera is very hard to set up on a wireless network , because the instructions are terrible . Once it is set up , it is a decent night vision surveillance camera . However , the green light on the front of the camera , which flashes all the time that it is connected wirelessly , makes it anything but discrete . I bought the camera to watch nocturnal wildlife in my garden - until the wildlife gets used to the flashing green light I wo n't see any . Having said that , the night vision is very good for the price . Ignore the included setup instructions - go online and search for help . To set it up on your wireless network you must first connect it by Ethernet cable to your wireless router - once you have done that you should be good to go . 	Telephone
best pair of headphones i own for anyones rock and hip hop needs ... high clarity and perfect amount of bass superfi -LRB- 160 $ -RRB- vs my shure e5c 's -LRB- 389 $ -RRB- okay so this does n't look like a fair match up at all but deciding which one to own depends on circumstance ... shure 's high 's and low 's are definitely better . . well they should for the tag but shure 's are very much lacking in bass and body which i found in these superfi 's also the superfi 's are more comfortable and can be worn walking on the streets as they do n't block out ALL sound so you do n't have to be scared of being run over by an oncoming bus if you do n't see it shure 's are better for jazz , classical , blues , anything that does n't require the bump that you need in hip hop and some rock . They are also better for stationary listening ... or in an environment where you do n't need to be aware of your environment . but if you listen to rock , hip hop , etc and you are someone that spends a lot of time outside walking with headphones , then these superfi 's are a perfect choice .

Pros : Do n't slip off your ears Great sound Cons : A little painful if in your ears for too long I would recommend getting some small pads to ease the tenderness in the ear lobes . Mine started hurting after about 25 minutes . Just a little longer than running with them for three miles . 	Telephone
We ordered this to replace an older iHome alarm clock\/radio iPod docking unit . One of the best features of this unit is it 's simplicity . Once you dock your iPod , it syncs up and displays the time carried by the iPod , no holding set buttons while turning dials and trying to read the display . Because we use this mostly for listening to audiobooks at night , with no need for alarms and radio stations and such , we have found it to be quite usable . The audio quality is decent , better than most clock radios , even if it is not as good as an all up stereo system , but perfect for audiobooks , and acceptable for music . The controls are very simple and intuitive : volume control for the iPod ; intensity control for the clock display ; and a separate intensity control for the base light , which makes a good night light . This unit is small , compact and attractive . It also comes with a sturdy support tab that holds the docked iPod at just the right angle , without putting extra stress on the electronics connector in the base of the iPod . 	Telephone
I had a pair of headphone from Radio Shack that finally gave out after 5 or 6 years . They were sturdy , had individual ear volume controls , good comfortably , well cushioned ear pieces . My daughter gave them to me as a gift when my hearing started declining . Unfortunately RC do n't have them anymore and I searched the net for something comparable . They do the job , but are not as comfortable , sturdy , and all the things I listed . The charging base and transmitter are hard to set up to charge the batteries in the set . Unless you 're desperate or cheap , do n't buy this JVC set 	Telephone
I 've had these earbuds for a few weeks and I am very pleased with thier performance . I use them to listen to podcasts and music and find the sound to be very good . The bass is a little heavy at times but its nothing you ca n't tone down with an equalizer . Also they fit in my ear quite well and block out a lot of ambient noise . 	Telephone
After the most wretched loss of my Sony MDR-EX51 Fontopia Earphones -LRB- I loved them so ... -RRB- , I had to replace them , as I had long ago jettisoned the original shoddy iPod earbuds , and had nothing to listen to my lovely iPod mini with . I found out about these and bought them . When I first pulled them out of the box , I was unprepared for how bloody humongous they were ! Then I put them on my head , made the proper adjustments , and cranked up the iPod . I was treated to some of the best sound quality I 've ever heard , almost but not quite surpassing my late Sony Fontopias . The bass was more pronounced with these than with the Fontopias , but the Fontopias were more bright in the higher ranges , which is what I prefer . However , for overall sound balance , these are winners ! A few gripes ... Firstly , the cord . It 's incredibly long , and I swear it 's thicker than my tongue ! -LRB- I 've never occasioned to measure -RRB- I 've resorted to retaining the original twist-tie that it came with in the packaging , ever since the cord got caught on a city bus door . Yeech , that was n't fun . Secondly , the headphones are a bit ungainly , being large , difficult to store , and just honkin ' huge ! They get painful because they tend to exert pressure on my eyeglasses after extended wear . Sure , they sound great , but for a high-speed , low-drag person like me , they are a bit hefty for daily use . I do n't mean to sound as if I 'm bashing these headphones , they sound fantastic ! They 're just not perfect , as nothing is , but hey , they are the best darned $ 20 earphones I 've ever bought ! I dominate in Counter-Strike as I can hear my enemies coming , and my music has seldom sounded better , as I listen to a wide variety of music from 50 Cent -LRB- Rap -RRB- and Juno Reactor -LRB- Trance -RRB- all the way to Checkfield -LRB- New Age -RRB- and Chuck Loeb -LRB- Jazz -RRB- . A good choice ! 	Telephone
I purchased this item for use on my plane flight down to Florida . I tall guy , and have had problems in the past finding over the ear phone that fit comfortably , not so with these , perfit fit and after 21\/2 hours of continous wear on the plane had no discomfort . NC was excellent , I was in the exit row of a boeing 737-700 , -LRB- right near the engines -RRB- and wehen switched on the environment got markedly quieter . When music was played , even at low volume , the sound was crips and clear with very accurate sound reproduction . also with music in the head phones , most if not oll of the external sound was drowned out . One last thing that was very handy was the monitor button which lets you here outside sounds with out removing the head phones , very useful for quick chats . 	Telephone

In the last 2 days I have had 3 of these phones , and none of them have worked . -LRB- if you want to use 2-lines -RRB- .

The customer service department had no idea how to help -LRB- really helpful -RRB- , said maybe i got one from a bad batch but I bought each of the 3 phones at different stores in CO. . Maybe the state got a bad batch . After all the hassel of buying , trying and then returning I think I will try a different brand . 	Telephone

I was excited when I saw the price because I 'd been looking for a cheap cordless that had an answering machine . I love the answering machine and the features that come with it . My problem is with the headset ; it is very hard to hear the person on the other end . I have to have the volume all the way up , but then I have to talk softly because I 'll hear myself YELLING and can BARELY hear the person on the other end . I have to be in a quiet room with no kids , TV or dogs to hear and use this phone , and most of the time , that just is n't possible . 	Telephone

I was just looking for a basic cordless caller I.D. phone , and while I appreciate the minimalist design and particularly the fact that it is packed without styrofoam or a bunch of plastic baggies , THIS PHONE HAS _ TERRIBLE _ SOUND . There is a lot of low-volume background static , and it would start to crackle and pop only 20-25 feet from the base . My old 900MHz has far superior sound and range . Incidentally , the design of the buttons on the handset makes for difficult programming and scrolling through menus . <p> I am very disappointed , and will have to resign myself to buying one of the silly shiny phones that looks like a space shuttle control panel .

Sennheiser 201 v 202 . tested on my PC with using mediamonkey \*\*\* Get the 201 \*\*\* I already had the 201 's , but my g\/f keeps stealing them , so I thought I would try the 202s , more of a good thing right ?! Cup size : 201 : the opening for the ear is a 1\/3 larger than the 202s . fit nicely around the ear . 202 : are almost on-the-ear style , although they are still comfortable . -LRB- no I do n't have floppy dumbo ears : p -RRB- Volume : 201 : 50 % is 202s . in others words , you have to double the volume on the 201s , to get about the same sound output as you just had with the 202s . 202 : 200 % of 201 . they are very sensitive . Sound Quality : I am a layman so bear with me . 201 : balanced , natural sounding . Good imaging . You can close your eyes and almost see the band , picking out subtle sounds . 202 : strong bass & highs . At a volume where you can hear the vocals & mids clearly , the bass & highs become painful pretty quickly . It has to be loud for clarity . Other thoughts : Many people complain of the 202s being uncomfortable . My belief is they are actually experiencing fatigue from the sound pressure of the bass which is required to hear the vocals and mids clearly . These two headphones are dirt cheap , yet one is clearly -LRB- 201 -RRB- better sounding than the other . I wonder which moderately priced -LRB- @ $ 40-70 -RRB- set might have far better imaging , balance , allow you to hear subtle sounds while still having full , rich bass , etc. . ? A few in that price range are : Sony MDR-V6 , Audio-Technica ATH-M30 , JVC HA-RX900 ? I would love your comments . I am older so a quality set where I do n't need to turn it up as loud would be wise . 	Telephone
I ordered these earbuds for my 15 year old son for Christmas . He had purchased some skullcandy earphones earlier in the month but was very disappointed in them and returned them and was using the original earphones for the IPhone .

This is amazing it works great for charging all my electronics and can take a beating .

Over all this is perfect if you have a lot of expensive electronics and you want to charge them while keeping the plugs organized and surge protected . 	Telephone
The product works great . The design was mature and efficient . It holds iphone tight . The directions can be adjusted in two orthogonal ways . The suction cup is very big so that it provides stronger stickiness to the wind shield . One thing to notice : the suction cup is too big for the dashboard mounting pad designed for TOMTOM GPS . Overall , the product deserve a five or more star review . I like it . 	Telephone
I typically use my iPod at the gym while working out . I have small ears and ca n't use earbuds ; I have yet to find a pair that will stay in my ears , so I am constantly readjusting earbuds and usually ca n't hear well . These headphones are light , comfortable and stay in my ears . Typically I listen to podcasts rather than music , and the sound quality is more than adequate for that . I have used this type of headphone in the past , and they do have a finite life , but then again they are fairly inexpensive . This time I bought two pair so I have a spare if the first set breaks .

I 've had this phone for a year and the only complaint I have isthat the battery has worn out to the point where sometimes the handsetdies during a conversation ...

It has a few manufacturing\/design flaws , but with a small effort , it works quite well . The opening in the plastic case for the mini-USB needed a little chamfering . The included cable had engagement lugs entirely too large for the charge socket , so it went in the recycle bin along with the suction cups . A full charge is not when the green LED next to 100 % is lit , but when the red LED on the side goes out . After a full charge from a USB 2.0 spec source -LRB- 500mA -RRB- , it charged my IPhone4 from 37 % to 90 % in about an hour . Another hour brought it to 100 % , with an additional 15 minutes to get the `` un-plug '' symbol . The green LED next to 50 % would still light at this point . The next day , 12\/1 in Atlanta , a nice clear day , I set it in direct sunlight from 10am to 3pm getting the 80 % LED . Next day from 11am to 3pm got the 100 % LED , but the red charge LED was still on . It required over 2 hours on a USB source for the red , charge LED to turn off . Not bad since we are less than 20 days from minimum solar declination . Thanks to all the ham-fisted people who are bad at math , I purchased for less than $ 30 and am pleased with this USB Solar charger . If it does does fail to function in the future , I look forward to splitting the case and doing an autopsy . 	Telephone
I own several pair and have owned several pairs of headphones . These rank up there with my very expensive headphones as far as sound quality goes in a small package . Of course you are not going to beat the big bulky head phones that fit snug on your ears though . These headphones do n't hurt your ears after a long time using them like those in-ear -LRB- ear buds -RRB- do either . I would not use these head phones for working out though as the tend to slip off of your head . The more you sweat and move the more they slip . It is very bothersome when you are using cables and you lean forward and your headphones slide off of your head and hang while you are in the middle of your set . Bottom line : If you are just going to walk or sit and listen to your headphones you can not beat these headphones ... especially for the money - you just ca n't . Now if you are going to workout or do anything that causes movement and sweating , even yard work , then go with something like the Philips SH390 -LRB- inexpinsive around $ 13.00 -RRB- that are snug . Again , you can not beat the Panasoni RP-HT21 for the price - just be worned if you attempt to work out with them . 	Telephone

I purchased these 14 months ago . During that time I was realtively satisfied . I think the sound is good , almost great . The flanged eartips fit great in my ear , especially if I trimmed down the large ones with an xacto knife . I like to go to sleep to music and these fit nicely in my ear , even with my head turned to the side . It all ends there . After 14 months , the left ear was sporadic and I had to jiggle the wire to get some sound . I sent them into etymotic and they said for $ 76 plus $ 6 shipping they would send me a new pair . I do n't think so . I took care of these . Yes I did wrap them around my iPod and put them in my back pack from time to time . Everyone does this . For a product that is not durable , these are NOT worth the money . For substantially less , the Senheiser or Sony models sound better and are more durable . Do n't waste your money !!!!! 	Telephone
Great product . Very comfortable to wear . Good delivery costs and the packaging was also very secure and safe . These are very high quality and a real pleasure to listen to music with . 	Telephone

In the last couple years I 've went through a couple sets of Sony mdr-v150s -LRB- great entry level pair . -RRB- For Christmas I got a pair of Piiq -LRB- Sony -RRB- Triqii and a set of Merkury Retro Stereo Headphones -LRB- M-HR110 -RRB- . I like how rugged the Piiqs are , but the fit sucks and so does their audio quality . I was thinking of exchanging them for a pair of V150s . I 'd never head of Merkury , and did n't give them much thought but decided to get them out of the box and try 'em . I like the look and the feel great on my big head , they do n't squeeze too tight , and they do n't fall off . I hooked them to my personal at home hi-fi and fired up Deftones new album Diamond Eyes on my turntable . AMAZING sound for a $ 15 pair of headphones ! I wish I had a pair of my old V150s to compare to , but I 'm pretty sure they sound a little better . The fit though really blows them out of the water . I ca n't say mch for durabilty since I 've owned them less than 24 hours , but they look like they 'll hold up alright - The head bands are foam wrapped steel wire . If you are looking for cheap headphones for whatever reason , give these a try . I 'm going to buy another pair or two to put back in case these break . 	Telephone
I was attracted to the VTech because you could add additional handsets and use the intercom feature from handset to handset , which was convenient . The accessory handset failed after less than 2 weeks and the keypad would n't respond - could n't dial or answer the phone . I exchanged the handset . The base handset then stopped ringing , not too convenient when you 're in the yard , expecting a call , and the phone does n't ring . I returned the phone . Two malfunctions in less than 4 weeks . On the plus side , I thought programming was very intuitive . 	Telephone
I 've tried to use this a number of times . The AC charger must be defective . It will indicate it is charging on the devices , but after leaving this on overnight , it appears to be a trickle charger . My iPad went from 14 % charge to 23 % after 12 hours on the AC charger . This item would be on its way back , if only I had saved the packaging material . Live and learn . 	Telephone
I got these and after a month of light use the mic crapped out . I troubleshot it and eventually came upon this piece of information at fixya.com `` The issue lies in the glass fiber wire , the wire is coated with a conductive metal only a few microns thick . Simply put the headset is a poor production model , the use of glass fiber wire more often than not results in a short in the wiring . Thus the sound will come out of one side , not at all , etc. '' Posted by avataraahrens on Jun 13 , 2009 These are wal-mart grade headphones : good enough to get by with until it breaks , which will likely happen shortly after purchasing it 	Telephone
I contacted to Seller for 3 continues days for their return policy . No body answering me . . Doubt about seller . 	Telephone
Have had this device a few weeks and have been very , very satisfied with it 's performance . I have an iPhone 3gs and bluetooth wraparound headphones that frequently go dead from cheesy battery syndrome . This 16 Amp device keeps everything powered and at full capacity for DAYS ! I should also mention that I purchased it 's little brother , the 8 Amp unit . I gave it to my son and he reports his new Infuse -LRB- ? -RRB- 4g phone -LRB- which sucks battery like the gov ' t sucks money -RRB- stayed fully charged for three days without going under 100 % power .

The sound quality is really awesome !! And it really worth 100 bucks . I love those headphones . They make you feel like you ' r there when you watch a movie on those ! 	Telephone
This thing is very cheaply made . After a month it started coming loose from the socket and had to be wiggled to get power through it . Then finally after 3 months , it just stopped putting power out through the USB outlets . And it started getting very hot - I finally smelled something burning and pulled it out of the socket and it was almost too hot to touch . It has a replaceable fuse , so I checked that and it had n't even tripped . Also , it has these bright blue lights , so that even if it 's just plugged into a socket it will drain your battery , even if you 're not charging anything . No problem if your socket is powered with the ignition key , but if you have a socket that is always powered you must remember to unplug this device or it will drain your battery . 	Telephone
I Had these for about two years they are very Good for the price . I Am pleased with every aspect , however the bass when they are used with a computer sound card and some devices without boost is hit or miss . I have also found that in almost all cases when listening to clasical music you need to bust the bass in order to balance the highs . 	Telephone
This is fun and great for kids . Super good for the price and good sound . The touchscreen work MOST of the time bot , overall a good mp3 player for a good price . 	Telephone
If you like the sound of good quality bookshelf speakers - with the woofers removed - you 'll love the ER6i 's . There 's a whole ritual involved in getting them inserted correctly -LRB- the casual observer might think you 're having a seizure -RRB- and even the slightest difference in the way they 're inserted causes significant changes in the sound , which goes from thin to thinner . Etymotic claims audiophile pleasing accuracy , but I do n't consider it accurate when you completely chop off the whole lower end of the audio spectrum . The wires russling against your clothing cause an distractingly loud noise in your ears as well . I bought the Ultimate Ears SuperFi 5 earphones a few weeks after giving up on the Etymotics and , even though the price of the UE 's is somewhat higher , the quality and extended range of their sound -LRB- full , deep , balanced bass , warm mids and clean highs -RRB- made it well worth it to me .

I was excited to get this for my wife 's car , as it is a 2005 MDX and does not have an AV input like the newer cars do . It seemed pretty straightforward and looked like I could use it right out of the box . However , when I tried using it or the first time , I found that I had to use quite a bit of force for it to stick into the cigarette lighter and actually get a charge . I managed to get it to work , but the slightest bit of bumpiness in the road would cause it to pop out of the cigarette lighter and cease working . In addition , the arm seems to rotate fairly easily from the base despite my attempts to tighten it , which would also dislodge the unit from the charger . I 'm giving it one star because the sound quality was actually good ... but only when it would work . I 'd learn from my mistake and invest in something else . 	Telephone
After reading all the reviews and high praise that these headphones received , and also after some extensive research -LRB- being sure not to purchase the counterfeit headphones -RRB- , I decided that these were the headphones for me -LRB- the review stating the proper use of these headphones is what sold me -RRB- . Boy was I wrong ! First off , the rubber that covers the wire feels very cheap and thin . It 's not durable and within a couple of uses , will easily start to wear and tear . Not good for functionality -LRB- especially if you use these headphones for anything from walking to exercise -RRB- . Second , the earbuds are not comfortable at all . I tried the smallest earbud covers as I know my ears are small , and could n't keep them in for long . It was just irritating -LRB- not at all like my sony earbuds -RRB- . These earbuds felt like they were stretching the inside of my ear . Not at all a comfortable feeling . I did manage to get them in deep enough as to hear the sound and not destroy my ear drum at the same time . As for the sound . I 'm not a connoisseur of music and sound but these headphones add no life to the music . The sound is bland , boring , and flat which makes the music loud and annoying -LRB- I mostly listen to rock , but also a wide range of other genres as well -RRB- . I 've even tried switching the different equalizer 's on my MP3 player and it gets no better . The headphones are advertised as to have bass but if that 's what they call bass , then they are sadly mistaken . The bass is nothing more than a boost in the low tones of the music . The high tones are way too loud and you ca n't even hear the midtones . These headphones are very overrated and sound just like a cheap pair of iPod-like headphones . These headphones definitely are n't the ones for me as I like my music to sound as if it 's alive and these headphones do n't do it . Does n't mean that these are n't the headphones for you . If you like flat and boring sound , then by all means , these would be perfect for you . Or -LRB- for the objective side -RRB- if you like your music loud , these are perfect because they can definitely get loud . And if you 're wondering if I got a counterfeit pair , well then I guess Amazon is selling counterfeits -LRB- not accusing of course , just sarcastically making a point on authenticity of headphones -RRB- because that 's where I got these from . If you do decide that these are for you , I have a pair that have only been used five times to test sound and would be glad to sell them to anyone who wants because I think , no , I 'm sure I 've just wasted 45.00 dollars .

Sound is decent but the earpieces are uncomfortable and break quite easily . 	Telephone
If you are looking for a headphone that reproduces excellent sound than you have found your product ! I use it for the nights I want to either watch a movie or play my PS3 and do n't want to to sacrifice the sound . I have a new baby in the house and hell to pay if I wake her up !! lol When I play the PS3 it is incredible how good you hear the details of the game . It is just like hearing it through my Sony surround sound system ! Bass is awesome too !! You can walk all over the house and not miss a thing ! Movies are just as good ! It is very easy to use and almost dummy proof . The only drawback is after time the headphones do get a little uncomfortable . I am very satisfied with them !! 	Telephone
"You get what you pay for ... even from Koss . I do n't really like the idea of jamming earphones INTO my ears and the earbuds never stay where I like .

I purchased the mp3 player for my boyfriend this past Christmas , and being that we are both swimmers ... there was this unspoken `` doubt '' between us about the product . But after taking it for a spin , I mean SWIM ... we could n't be happier . Moving the music from his iTunes onto this MP3 player was very easy . This player far exceeds what I could have even hoped for sound wise . Plus , when underwater , the sound conducts even better . Headphones are easy to adjust . This purchase was one of the best that I made this holiday season and I would highly recommend it to anyone . I am buying another one for myself . You WILL NOT be disappointed . 	Telephone
This product was great . When I received it I unpacked it and plugged it into the usb 2.0 port , it found the software on the internet and installed it . That is pretty much the end of the story . Great clarity and the built in microphone is very sensitive . I would recommend this to anyone . Gerry 	Telephone
Loved it so much , that I bought another to place it in the other room where there 's two lines . Less clutter -LRB- no need for two base phone systems -RRB- on the desk . 	Telephone
I was extremely impressed with the quality of the product . I was able to backup some very old cassette tapes to MP3 while at the same time increasing the volume because some of the cassettes tended to be too quiet . I found that for my particular use , Drum Corps recordings , increasing the volume by 3.5 db was just about perfect . I was aiming for upper `` yellow '' range for recording which seemed to increase the volume of the quiet parts substantially while not overdoing the very loud parts . The only downside was the software . The bundled software was fine but it required the use of iTunes and I ca n't stand Apple 's bloated software . I made sure I installed Revo Uninstaller FIRST then installed iTunes without Safari and Quicktime . After I was done recording I Revo Uninstalled the Apple junk . I installed the software on an older computer because I do n't want the Apple software on my main computer . I was concerned about CPU\/Ram usage and whether the computer would slow down but even with my older Pentium 4 3.0 ghz single core processor it ran smoothly with plenty of power to spare . Even with the downside of the software , I still highly recommend this product to anyone who wants to backup cassettes to MP3\/CD . 	Telephone

I already had a Foscam IP Camera . So I bought this one for much less . The setup is exactly the same . I even used the previous Foscam software to add this IP Camera . Works the same . Pictures quality is the same . Only difference is I can turn off the IR lights on the Foscam , this camera 's IR lights are always on . Motion detection adjusts better with this camera than the Foscam . I can also access this camera with my Foscam iPhone\/iPad app . I use Surveilence Pro for Foscam . If you are going to set any I P camera up you need to know how to port forward your router . It 's not difficult . YouTube has How-to-videos . I already knew how to that procedure . It a great cheap way to have a remote monitor at home or office . Mine does a great job and is set to record any break-in and immediately email my iPhone . 	Telephone
This is one of the best FM modulators I 've used . Sound comes in clear without any noticable static . I 've always used a tape adapter because I could fine any modulators worth using . All the functions work and so far have n't had any issues other than taking a call in which the person on the other line could n't hear me . Never happened again and not sure if it was my iphone . The only issue I have is that it did n't come with any instructions , which would probably aggrivate some people , and the head unit is a little heavy with the phone so if you have a loose fit in your cigarette lighter jack , it may move on you due to vehicle vibrations . If you 're jack is on a center console pointing down , this would be the ideal set up for this item . Also have n't been able to verify that the remote works . It states it 's for ipod only and I do n't have one . Tried it on my iphone and it did n't work . I guess some instructions might help . 	Telephone
This vacuum has a lot of power for a cordless stick vacuum , is easy to clean and is always there fully charged when I need it . I had never used a cordless stick vacuum before but the usefulness and versatility is great . This unit in particular is also easily adjusted to go under things . I find myself willing to clean my floors more promptly due to the convenience as compared to having to use a corded vacuum . It is worth noting though , that it works better for hard surfaces -LRB- vinyl , ceramic , hardwood , etc. -RRB- than for carpets . As far as power , the battery technology in this unit is amazing as it has good suction and a beater bar that you can optionally turn on . Also , the charge lasts quite a while , probably 10 or 15 minutes , before you start to notice some losses . But that 's a long time when you are just using the unit for quick clean ups here and there and then put it back on the charger . Excellent product . 	Vacuum
This product was purchased for a high school graduation gift . Remark : I like this ; I really do like this . Great idea . Ordering from Amazon was much more convenient and efficient than purchasing otherwise . 	Vacuum
This is an excellent vacuum however it is very heavy . Being of short statue and not very strong my husband usually does the vacuuming since we bought this . It takes off forward very easily but is very hard when pulling it back . `` It probably picks up better than any vacuum I 've ever had tho and I 've had alot in my 65 years . '' I highly recommend this . It even picks up tiny threads that are always on my quilt studio floor . 	Vacuum
For the price and the features this is one vacuum to look at . The only draw back is the weight . You would n't think 25lbs is much untill you have to push it back and forth over 2000 square feet of carpet . I look at it as excercise but some may dread vacuum day . Lift one at Walmart or Sears and make your own mind up before buying . 	Vacuum
We bought this to use at the beach house . It has great suction , and works like a dream . It is heavier than I expected , but that would n't stop me from buying another one . 	Vacuum
The vacuum looks great but does not have any power . Add the hose and the other tools and it just gets worse ! You would be better off with a wisk broom and a dust Pan ! Hate this product and may return it if I can find the box . Shame on you Black and Decker ... Made in China K R A P ! 	Vacuum
Less than a year old , less than 5 charges and the charger went bad and probably it damaged the battery . The vacuum did n't last too long , five minutes and the battery was drained . I wanted to buy another charger but it seems that it is a difficult charger to find . It is a 16VAC ~ 150MA . -LRB- AC is alternating current and most places I went they sell DC or DIRECT CURRENT . -RRB- I definitely would never recommend this hand vacuum . 	Vacuum

I 've had this vacuum for several months now , and I 'm quite puzzled by the negative reviews it 's gotten . It DOES sound like maybe there were some lemons out there , but once these folks figured out how to work it , or got it replaced it was ok . We have 2 very long-haired dogs -- there is always a TON of dog hair on the carpet . Plus we 're all `` indoor outdoor '' so there 's plenty of dirt getting tracked on our carpets too . I vacuum about once a week . I turn this vac on and it does an awesome job -- it 's got so much suction that I have to turn down the volume when I go over my throw rugs or it lifts them off the ground . It has incredible suction through the wand too -- I have nabbed flying insects from several inches away this last week -- hah ! I ca n't stand the enormous mess of bagless vacs -LRB- a ridiculous trend in vacs if you need heavy duty cleaning -RRB- , and this vac has disposable HEPA bags -- which was tops on my list . The bags that are meant to be purchased with it contain the unpleasant dog smell which eventually accumulates -- and they work great !!! I 've never had a vac that did that . It 's got a very simple on\/off switch , not a foot pedal , which I 'm happy about . It has multiple on-board attachments . It has a nice large valve -LRB- ? -RRB- that you turn to go from floor to hose suction -- always a problem previously for me . And it has the ability to turn off the rotating brush when you 're working on bare floors -- although I do n't have a problem w \/ keeping it on when I 'm going over the tile in kitchen . It has an enormous long cord which lets me cover a HUGE amount of living room\/dining room without switching outlets . My ONLY complaint is that the latch that lets you release it from it 's upright position is slightly difficult for me to get it to work in my houseshoes\/boots . But I figure that 's me and my selection of footwear -- I eventually give it enough pressure and it releases . I honestly ca n't say enough good things about this vac -- it has enormous power , no smell , long cord , can do carpet or hard floors well , etc. . It 's not ultra-light or quiet -- but I 've had dogs long enough to know that I ca n't get the cleaning I want w \/ some wimpy vac . But it 's not so heavy I have a problem with it -- maybe my mother would , she 's 75 . It rolls really well though , so you can just roll it backwards on 2 wheels very very easily . And the husband says it 's a lot quieter than the last one , a Dirt Devil which did n't so squat . so go figure . It DOES the job it says it will do -- I could n't be more pleased w \/ something I absolutely depend on . 	Vacuum
I have had this vaccum for a little over a month , and so far , it works fantastically ! I use it almost daily , and it picks up everything in its path . The on board tools are great for vaccuming the sofa . I would definitley recommend this vacuum to anyone who needs a good vacuum on a budget . 	Vacuum
The Amazon\/B & D description is accurate . It does n't show in the pics I saw of it , but two of the attachments sit in a cradle that attaches to the unit . You can remove the vac from the cradle , but I 've never found reason to do so while using it -- and having the two most used attachments always there is nice . It is not uncomfortably loud , from similar item in stores I 've turned on , it seems a bit quieter than average . Your hearing\/mileage may vary . Read the instructions fully . It states you need to charge it up to 5 times -LRB- from an empty or nearly empty charge -RRB- before the battery hits its stride . They are correct ! The first time I charged it over-night , the battery maybe lasted a combined 7 minutes -LRB- and I 'm being generous -RRB- . I am only on the 4th charge cycle but each time I have seen steady improvement in battery life . The instructions state B&D has already paid the battery recycling fee -LRB- obviously included in the price of the unit -RRB- ; there is a toll-free number to call where another company will send you a prepaid package to send the batteries back when they finally do die . It 's free of charge -LRB- you paid for it -RRB- , and in this crazy world it might not seem like a big deal -- but call and have the batteries recycled properly . -LRB- -LRB- and I 'm not some Prius driving hipster driving a car that uses more `` natural resources '' to manufacture than a standard petrol powered vehicle - it 's just the right thing to do -RRB- -RRB- 	Vacuum
About a week after I bought this product the belt broke . My neighbors had bought it recently too and they put it out on the curb for the trash collectors as their 's broke too . My partner fixed the belt , but it does n't really work that well , especially with the attachments . Would not buy it again ! 	Vacuum
I love this thing . Trying to clean up after a dog and a contractor is not easy . But having the Roomba do the vacuuming everyday makes it sooo much easier . 	Vacuum
Relocated into a smaller living space and in need of a new compact vacuum with great suction , easy to store and equipped with all the needed cleaning tools . The Hoover Portapower fulfills all my needs . Easy storage and because it 's rated `` commercial , '' has fabulous suction , in addition to the standard cleaning implements . Best of all , it has an extremely long cord , allowing ample floor space to be covered , before having to unplug . Although it does n't have wheels , it 's light enough to carry about . A shoulder strap is provided , if needed . Only improvement would be a retractable cord . There is sooooo moch cord , it 's difficult to gather it together and bind in a provided snap strap . Best available compact vacuum for the price . 	Vacuum
I bought this vacuum for myself as a Mother 's Day gift a few months ago . I had the blue Miele canister vac before this one -LRB- the S-151 , I think -RRB- and I absolutely loved it . It lasted 12 years and is actually still running , just not as powerful as it was when it was new . Anyways , I tried out the S7210 Twist in a local store and decided to switch to an upright . It handles quiete nicely , it almost feels like it 's self-propelled when the carpet powerbrush feature is on . With the canister , I always felt like I had to put a ton of pressure on it in order to pick up the dog hair off the rugs , but with this one it 's so much easier . I have a German Shepherd and the Twist picks up the hair like a charm . It does great on hardwood floors too , but you should use the bare floor function instead of the powerbrush to prevent scratching your floor up . Note that there is a more expensive model available that features a HEPA filter , but truthfully , this one is just as good . It does have a slot to install a HEPA filter if you want to , so you do have that option . I beieve the HEPA filters are around $ 50 and need to be replaced every year or so . That 's not an investment I wanted to make . I have mostly area rugs and hard wood floors , so I did n't feel like I needed one . Some people complain about the price of the bags for Miele vacuums , but if you think about it , they do last a lot longer than say the ones a Hoover uses . I have never had a bag break on me when I took it out , they are extremely sturdy . I would say that I only use about 5 bags a year and I vacuum at least once a week -LRB- because of the dog hair -RRB- . Overall , I am very happy with my purchase . Miele is probably the best brand out there when it comes to vacuums . If you want something that is going to last , get the Miele ! One more thing : You should try it in a local store and then order it online . It will save you so much money ! 	Vacuum
WOW - MY LITTLE LEO -LRB- CAT -RRB- MUST BE CARRYING LITTER BETWEEN HIS TOE NUCKES\/NAILS - REALLY GREAT VACCUM . WHAT A DEAL FOR 80 .00 BUCKS - LOVE LOVE LOVE !!!!!!!!!!! 	Vacuum
I agree with some of the other reviews about the product being made cheap . I think it does a great job on my carpets , but in just a few months , the foot pedal started popping off everytime I used it . Without the foot pedal , the vacuum wo n't stay upright without falling over . I think this could be a great product with some minor changes in the design , but I would be hesitant to buy this again . I have only had mine a year , and I am already looking to buy a new vacuum . 	Vacuum
Most suction power of any vac I ever used . Heavier than I thought . This is not for the average woman you will need a strong back to use this thing . Cleaning cloth bag is a messy project . I ordered some replaceable bags . The attachments are CHEAP no other way to say it . They do n't look like they belong with the machine . They look more like they are for a toy . Good thing there is a 2 year warranty . I hope Hoover lives up to it . The end of the hose that attaches to the vac is already coming apart and the wands dent VERY easily . Plastic would have been preferable to the ultra thin metal tubes . Too bad they cheaped out on the attachments because otherwise this would be a great machine . 	Vacuum
I wish there was a NO STAR option . We bought our BOSS about 10 months ago for light cleanings between the housekeeper coming out . My wife complained after a week that it kept shutting itself off so I took it apart and cleaned all the filters . I ran it for a few minutes and told her it was fine now - did n't think much of it . A week later she reported the Power Paw stopped working . A week after that she reported the vacuum was shutting itself off again . I cleaned all the filters -LRB- again -RRB- and gave it back to her . The filters were not dirty , but I cleaned them anyway since it did the trick the last time . She said it was a pain and stopped using the vacuum alltogether - went back to her old stick vacuum . Fast forward several months - we now have a dog and it was time to break out THE BOSS again . This time I took control -LRB- convinced my wife was doing something wrong -RRB- . After apologizing to her for thinking she was wrong , and apologizing again for not returning the vacuum while it was still under warranty I am now on a quest to buy a new vacuum . I 'm glad to read so many positive reviews - let 's see how those vacuums hold up after a few months of `` light housework '' . JUNK - very disappointed - very . I guess in some cases you really do get what you pay for . 	Vacuum
Thought I picked a good product but the suction leaves a lot to be desired . I bought this because I did not want to carry out my large vacuum cleaner . Not worth the price ! 	Vacuum
I bought this vacuum at least one year ago and it still works well . For the money , it 's a good value . Two negatives : heavy , especially when carrying up stairs ; and the bare floor\/rug switch is difficult to switch without a struggle . No big deal , though . I 'm pleased with this purchase .

The product meets the advertised claims . Very handy on hard floors . A bit heavy but very manageable . Really gets under the bed easily and kills the huge dust bunny that lives there . Cleans out easily . I would buy another without hesitation . Would be very handy in an RV since it stores compactly in the included charging stand and is powerful enough for light clean up on the carpeted areas . 	Vacuum

I received Black & Decker PAV1200W 12-Volt Cyclonic-Action Automotive Pivoting-Nose Handheld Vacuum Cleaner in very good condition , it 's working well , but upholstery brush which suppose to be included was n't in the package . Package was n't broken or damaged , may be seller forget to put it inside . I try to contact with customer service . They send me e-mail with apology , they will check in their stock of the vacuums and see if they have this brush in their kits . They will send me a brush if they do , also they promise contact with me later but they did not ! I did not sent this vacuum back because we need it and already started to use it . Hopefully I will recieve missing brush , otherwise this is a good item ! 	Vacuum
I got my new vacuum yesterday . I took it out of the box and within 5 minutes it was fully assembled . I did n't even need to read the directions it was pretty simple . I vacuumed my area rug and half the container was already full of dirt and debris . I am pretty happy with the purchase so far , packing was good and shipping was very fast -LRB- next day -RRB- . I rated this item only 4 stars because it has only been 1 day since I got it and I was n't to impress with the smell of the new motor . I am hoping it subsides the more I use it . The product comes with a 1-year warrantee . It does n't feel to flimsy . The light in the front is very helpful in low-lit areas . 	Vacuum
It 's compact , easy to clean out , and handy . Not terribly impressive on either wood floors or carpet , but for the price , it 's gist fine . I had a tough time cleaning the hair -LRB- we have longish stuff in our home -RRB- out of the roller bar . Interesting idea : washing the filters clean after dumping out the stuff collected - very green . Not sure how long it 'll last . A relative has had one for a couple of years and is ready to move on to a more substantial and dependable vacuum . 	Vacuum
this vacuum cleaner is heavy to lift or move in another direction , it is covered with dust on bottom part of machine . It seems to pick up dirt very good but I used on my sofa where the pet hair was the worst but it did not do a good job at all . I did like it for a large area because it moves by itself just when you change direction it is heavy . I like the attachments with it , so easy to use for sofas . 	Vacuum
This product vacuums and picks up quite well . It is somewhat heavy , but heavy is good because holds to the floor , et al. . My wife delegates me to operate this . Fold-up to store , clean : requires a little dexterity , and in cleaning out the accumulates , it 's best held over a waste basket . There are two filters , which should be `` serviced '' . Filters keep air clean . Pleased with the purchase , the vacuum is solid in consturction . It is good value , engineered well . . 	Vacuum
We had high hopes for this vac . It was even a present for the wife . The battery life is lousy . We can only vac a small room then the battery dies . I do n't expect to vacuum the entire house , but I would be nice to have in case . All the charging going on just to vacuum one room . Does n't pick up that well either . 	Vacuum
This is the second one I bought . It comes with a nice array of attachments . It 's power is higher than most wired auto vac 's and it does n't rely on batteries that fail you in the middle of a job . This is a simple , but higly functional product you will enjoy . 	Vacuum
LOVE this vacuum cleaner !! Good suction , long cord , lightweight and easy to steer . My past two vacuums have been a Eureka and then a Hoover windtunnel , both of which I liked until they started to fall apart within a year of purchase . The wheel came off the Eureka and some of the onboard tools would not stay in place as was also the case with the Hoover . The on\/off switch on the Hoover shorted out after a year and a half of use . To be fair to the manufacturer I must admit I am pretty tough on my vacuums but not to the point where they should have parts falling off . I prefer bagless vacuums but am pleased so far with this cleaner as the dust does not seem to escape the bag when in use . I would also like a longer hose to attatch the tools to and will check to see if one is available for purchase . 	Vacuum
The B&D PAV1200W works better than I anticipated . It has very good power for getting all sizes of particles out of the carpets . The telescoping built-in extension nozzle reaches into the hard to access places , like under the pedals and the outer sides of front seats . The extra long power cable is also a nice feature . 	Vacuum
I love this little vac . It has excellent suction power , and the pet hair attachment really works ! Nice ergonomic shape and weight . However , the battery life is poor . The other reviewers are not joking or exaggerating ! It runs great for about 5-10 minutes and then gives out . It then has to be charged for half a day to bring it back to life . This is ridiculous . It would be well worth the price if it ran for a reasonable period of time , but the battery is a major issue , and therefore I recommend that people who are considering it to look elsewhere . 	Vacuum
In short , this is an excellent vacuum at a very reasonable price . Incredible suction , and the hair from my husky is completely gone from the floors and couches thanks to the power paw attachment . If you 're a pet owner that is serious about clean but does n't want to break the bank , this is the vacuum for you . Also , inexpensive generic consumables are available for this item , such as bags at around 90 cents each , and HEPA filters at $ 10 each . The unit is very easy to maintain and clean out pipes , filters , and change bags . Great product , great price , inexpensive consumables , and easy to maintain . Of course there are the cons : bags sometimes come loose if not installed properly the first time . Took me a couple of tries to fully learn how to install the bags correctly . It can be difficult to close the front door on the unit , sometimes you have to wiggle it around till it clicks . Unit is heavy ! The foot release is difficult to press down on . All in all , an excellent value , and a great performing vacuum . 	Vacuum
This is a good vacuum . Good suction , easy to empty . Works great on floors and carpets . But , and I 'm surprised I have n't seen this in more comments , it spews dust if you want to use the detachable parts . If you want to use the wand or brush , you detach the hose from the bottom part that vacuums the floor . However , once you turn the vacuum on , you get suction in both the hose and the floor-cleaning part . And because the hose is not attached to the bottom , everything that part sucks up is shot back out from the hole in the back , covering the vacuum in dust and dirt . I 've been countering that by putting a tissue in the opening , and that seems to block the barrage of dust , but I 'm not terribly happy at having to do that . Seems like something that should n't be an issue in the first place . 	Vacuum
TERRIBLE QUALITY : My mom bought this for me at Costco after I had done lots of research . We did n't get to test it out because the models are locked in place . It replaced my cheap and efficent Sharp vacuum that I had used for 12 years . I could n't believe how heavy it was . It does n't have a direct drive so moving it back and forth takes effort -LRB- I 'm a strong person - but my Sharp was s nice and easy -RRB- . After 3 months with use about 1 time a week the hose broke and I duck-taped it together . After 6 months the on\/off switch broke so when it is plugged in , it is on . Now a year and half later the carpet aggitator broke . I 've replaced many belts in my years and I replaced this belt but that was n't the problem . I 'm happy it broke because now I have an excuse to get a good vacuum . Do n't waste your money . 	Vacuum
I have had this vacuum charging for over 24 hours . I use it just in my room to clean up bird dander , feathers and the odd crumb that ends up on my floor . It literally cleans for 5 minutes . What am I going to vacuum in 5 minutes ? It could at least keep the battery charged while having it plugged in while using , but it does n't even do that . I would hope there is just something wrong with the battery but it does n't seem that way , so this is a terrible product . I do n't know where these good reviews are coming from . I guess the attachments are pretty nice . 	Vacuum
Great vacuum , this is the second one i 've bought and for the money there are nun better . Just keep the filters clean . My first one is five years old and still works fine , use it for the rent house now . My new one works great and i 'm very happy with it . 	Vacuum
I bought this vacuum about 6 months ago and it has been a life saver . I have a dog and a cat , both shed like crazy . After using this vacuum almost 100 % of the hair was removed . The smaller brush works great on stairs , and makes it a lot easier to clean hair off furniture as well . My dog dragged a bunch of mud into the house , after the mud dried we used the vacuum to suck it out and now it looks like nothing happened . Even if this vacuum breaks after a year it is still worth buying . I like that it uses the bags because its easier to clean up and no dust ! Truly a great vacuum , and I would recommend it to anyone with little or large messes . 	Vacuum
My old Bissell had finally gotten weak , so I when I got this new one , I was very surprised at how well a machine could work . With the brush barely touching the carpet , it practically pulls itself across the floor . I should have traded up long ago . It lifts up my tired carpet fibers and gives the room a much nicer appearance . 	Vacuum
The USB vac is very low quality . It 's basically a fan with a little nozzle on it . Now remember when I said fan ? Well , a fan does not a vacuum make . Sigh . The not-a-vacuum usb noise maker also broke while I was trying to make it vacuum . I did n't force it , I was n't rough . The nozzle fell off and refused to be reattached without some serious grunting and cussing . Metro Vac makes a $ -LRB- ... -RRB- version . I hate to spend that much money , but I hate for things to be icky dirty even more . What a spectacular waste of -LRB- ... -RRB- bucks . 	Vacuum
I spent a lot of time researching vacuums and decided that we would buy this . I purchased it about 4 months ago . I realize that if I had purchased a $ 400 vacuum I probably would n't have these issue , but we ca n't afford that . This vacuum does as all do and vacumms up the everyday dirt , but there are some issues I want to make sure other buyers are aware of prior to their purchasing this product . The only good thing I have noticed is that the one attachment -LRB- Not the Pet -RRB- works great on pet hair . Better than my old Dirt Devil . If you do n't mind my frustrations outlined below , then you will be happy with your purchase . My issues : 1 . THE FILTERS are horrible to clean and unless you clean them there is no suction . You have to clean two areas and one does not remove from the vacuum so is almost impossible to clean . The filter itself is made of two sections , a foam outer section and the inner filter . The only way to get it really clean is to wash it which is what the instructions say to do after every use . -LRB- Which in itself is a pain . I haved decided that it works fine to do every other time or so . -RRB- The issue is it takes forever for the inner filter to dry . So make sure you have vacuumed everything you need to prior to washing otherwise you ca n't use your vacuum with a wet filter . This happened to me , I realized I missed a large area and had to wait to vacuum it , and it made me really mad . 2 . If you are buying this for the PET ATTACHMENT , do n't . I tried to use it and the attachment locked up and will not spin . Have been unable to remedy and the tool is useless . 3 . My old vacuum had a way to SHUT OFF SPINNING BRUSHES when using the hand attachment and I miss that . Every time I use the hand tool I have to angle the vacuum so that it does n't ruin my carpet . 4 . The HAND ATTACHMENT HOSE does n't go very far at all . You have to keep the machine close to where ever you are using it . Like I said earilier , it works well for the price , but just be aware of the frustrations to use it . If you do clean the filter properly it does have decent suction and works well . Happy Shopping ! 	Vacuum
I had a Hoover Portapower before that lasted 20 years and I loved it , so I wanted to purchase another one again . The old one still worked but the hose broke -LRB- run over by car -RRB- and the bag is broken . I do like the new vacuum . It has good suction and lots of attachments and a nice long cord . The only thing I do n't like is that the hose is too short , and everytime I vac the whole canister moves and hits me in the leg . So , I usually just hold it in my hand , or it has a shoulder strap . Picks up pet hair and works well on hardwood floors and is very light . 	Vacuum
AS the title says , for the price this is a great vacuum . My wife and I have a 2000 sq ft house that is mostly hardwood with some carpets . It cleans on both nicely . When we get the dog she wants , or the kids we both want I think we may upgrade . I might be totally underestimating this though . I 've yet to see how it handles pet hair , or how messy my future kids will be . Pluses : The canister is easy to clean . There is an adjusting knob for the floor type you 're vacuuming . Lastly , I have n't had to use the added pieces because simply removing the house has proven sufficient for picking up anything the base ca n't . The one negative I can think of ... as with most vacuums the cord is a bit of a chore . All in all , it 's cheap , it works . Great for light vacuuming and possibly more . 	Vacuum
I have had my Hoover Portapower vacuum for 30 years now , YES - 30 years ! Still works great , but have had to use tape to hold the wands together -LRB- connection finally wore out after 30 years -RRB- ... and had replaced the cloth bag two years ago . WE USE THIS THING FOR EVERYTHING ... from floors , to walls , to cars and furniture ... you name , we have used it . My oldest daughter tried to take it with her when she got married last year ... caught her ! This thing is older than her !! She 's 24 , my vac is 30 ! It still sucks as good as it did the day I bought it 30 years ago ! I am keeping my old one for the garage , but its time to get a new one for the house ... I would n't waste my hard earned money on any other brand . Hoover is the only brand my parents used when I grew up , and that 's all I have ever used . Their quality speaks for themselves . Looking forward to another great product from Hoover . I will not get rid of the old Portapower , as it still works well ... just retiring it to the garage and bringing in a new one for the house ! 	Vacuum
I own my own cleaning business and this vacuum is a time saver on stairs and hardwood floors . Any high pill carpets though I have to use another vacuum for . Light weight and great . 	Vacuum
My wife and I had decided several years ago to go with a bagless model also made by Eureka . Not a good idea , for us anyway . The dirt cup filled up quickly with our Golden Retriever 's hair and was constantly clogging . When I decided to go back to this model that uses bags I was a little bit skeptical thinking we were making a move backwards in ` cleaning technology ' . I 'm glad we did now though . We 've had this machine for a couple of months and it is by far a better unit . This vacuum has not clogged once in that time and even with our constant need to pick up West Texas dirt the bag is only about half full in that time . You do need to adjust for carpet height closely to maintain a good suction , but it 's very simple to tell when it 's not adjusted correctly . My only concern has been with the light plastic construction on some parts , but I guess that 's the trade off you make for a lower price . We also bought the year supply of bags , filters , etc. and after seeing the retail price of bags around town , we are glad we did . If you do n't want to spend the money on Dyson or another high dollar machine , this is a good choice . 	Vacuum
I bought this after getting fed up with emptying my canister vacuum and sucking dust , and who knows what else , each time . I just could n't quantify spending as much money as I did only to inhale everything I 'd just cleaned out of my house . The end result was that I vacuumed less when the canister began to get on the full side because I hated the idea of having to empty it . So that 's why I bought it in the first place . As soon as I took it out of the box I was pretty thrilled with the purchase . All of the accessories attach to the unit securely and I have n't had a single piece pop off on it 's own even when lugging it up stairs , down stairs , and putting it in the back of my car . At the same time they 're easy to put on and take off when you want . The only slight exceptions may be the power paw and the ` wide ' attachment for the hose . I have n't had any problems with them but I can see how they might cause problems . The power paw is the least securely attached and the wide attachment is the most securely attached and slightly covered by the cord when wound up . Pros : Where do I start ? 1 -RRB- It 's powerful . This is easily one of the most powerful vacuums I 've ever used . It sucks the litter right out of my litter-catcher-rug that I have in front of our cat box . I used to have to shake the rug out and vacuum the litter off the tile , but now I just pop on the wide attachment for the hose and go to town . 2 -RRB- It has as all the most practical attachments included plus the power paw . This pro is just about standards . All vacuums should come with the primary attachments and this one does and they throw in the power paw which is really great for stairs ... just like they advertise it to be . as for the power paw , it rotates via suction . I had a bagless with this attachment and it would lose suction so quickly -LRB- pet hair in the filter -RRB- that this attachment was useless . On this vacuum the power paw is like a freaking chainsaw no matter how much hair it sucks up . 3 -RRB- It 's easy and fast to switch from floor to hose setting and back again . I can literally go from vacuuming the floor to using the hose in 5 seconds or less and I can go from vacuuming the floor to using the hose with any attachment + the extensions in 10 seconds or less and it only takes very slightly longer to put it all back and continue vacuuming the floor . Gone are the days for me that I do all my floor vacuuming and then follow up with the hose . Now I can do everything in one pass . 4 -RRB- The floor brush can be engaged\/disengaged with the flick of a switch for easy transition from carpet to bare floors . This is the first vacuum I 've owned that I can do this on and I will never go back ! Vacuuming bare floor while the brush is spinning was like ... well ... it just did n't work . All it did was turn everything on the floor into tiny projectiles that were launched at my feet and shins . Being able to turn off the brush ... it was one of those , `` Finally ! '' moments for me . What I mean is , I can finally just use the vacuum on my bare floors instead of the vacuum\/broom combo . I used to sweep the bare floor up then follow up with the vacuum to get all the corners the the broom could n't clear . Now , because of this feature and # 3 , just the vacuum , easy peasy . 5 -RRB- It has a hepa filter that is easy to access for removal and installation . I have n't had to replace it yet but I did open it up and remove it and install it just to see what it was like . Super easy . 6 -RRB- It has a light on the base for dark corners . This is good for unlit or not-well-lit areas of the room . Personally , I 've found this more of a novelty than something I 'd require in a future vacuum purchase . 7 -RRB- The bag is easy to remove and install . Again , this is just about standards . The last bagged vacuum I had was a soft top -LRB- the bag was inside of a zippered bag -RRB- so it was ridiculous to get the bag out and put it back it . It was the vacuum that put me off bagged vacuums . I went to canister and did n't go back until now ... over a decade later . 8 -RRB- Wide track . This is just a convenient feature . Wider track = less passes . I have n't , as of yet , had any situations where it was too wide to fit somewhere I needed it to . 9 -RRB- It 's a bagged vacuum . Like I said on # 7 , I have been using bagless\/canister vacuums for over a decade now . I finally got so fed up with the dust cloud when emptying them and tapping out the filters so I would n't have to spend another $ 20 so soon . I even made a special tool so that I could attach my filter to my drill and spin the dust that was packed so tightly in there out with centrifugal force . This , obviously , just made the dust cloud during canister emptying worse but if I wanted the vacuum to have any suction it was necessary . Even then , I 'd lose suction steadily as I sucked up the cat hair . Since I did n't feel like dishing out $ 300 - $ 600 for a canister vacuum that `` never loses suction '' yet still dealing with the cloud of nasty when I emptied the canister I bought this bagged vacuum . There is still the bit of dust that poofs up when you detach the bag from the vacuum and there is a possibility of dust that puffs out if you compress the bag but nowhere near the amount of a canister . If you 're careful , there is no dust cloud at all , which is freaking awesome . No more dust mask and goggles for me while emptying canisters ! 10 -RRB- Last minute addition after writing in my cons . There is a second handle low on the vacuum for carrying up stairs . It makes it so much easier to handle ... no pun intended . Cons : 1 -RRB- It 's loud , as with every other vacuum I 've ever owned . Not really a true con as all vacuums are loud but it 's still advisory to wear hearing protection when using it . 2 -RRB- It 's kind of heavy . This is n't a con for me but my wife has some trouble with it when it comes to stairs . 3 -RRB- The handle is n't as comfortable as it could be . Although not entirely uncomfortable it 's not as nice as some of their other models . 4 -RRB- The light on the base is n't quite as bright as it could be . At first I thought that it would be a really great feature but it 's not quite bright enough to make a significant difference in visibility in my opinion . They could have put a much brighter system in here quite easily . Hope this helps you with your decision ! 	Vacuum
I 've had this vacuum for about a year now , replacing my bagged 12 amp Dirt Devil when it died , slayed by my long hair . I shed quite a bit , and the poor Dirt Devil 's motor and brushes were no match for my hair 's ability to clog the brushes and muck up the works . Enter the Bissell Cleanview Helix . It does a great job , and between two filters and the main debris canister , gets a ton of stuff . I love the on-board attachments -- they all work well -- and the ability to adjust the main vacuum brush to the floor surface -LRB- it has about five settings depending on how high your carpet nap is , including a bare floor setting , perfect for my 6 square feet of kitchen tile . Cleaning the top filter is super-simple and can be done in less than a minute , but the bottom one takes a bit more work -- all of five minutes . Oh , life is hard . Minus one star for the allergy-triggering that happens when I empty & clean the vac filters . 	Vacuum
Mom needed a lightweight vac to use on stairs . I was leary of purchasing a cordless vac , thinking battery would not last long enough . Well , Mom just loves it . It is light enough and the charge lasted even longer than needed to completely vacuum the staircase . Also , the suction was good . 	Vacuum
I have Electrolux cordless vacuum . So I can compare only to Electolux . B&D is not elegant or light as Electrolux . Does n't have detachable handheld vacuum . Removing and cleaning dirt from unit is not so easy as with Electrolux . But this small monster makes work done . It is really able to vacuum , pickup pets hairs , dirt from floor and rags . And it is able to run on one charge long enough to finish job . Electrolux is able to pickup only light dust from bare floor for 5 min . I am very satisfied with B&D . 	Vacuum
Works great . Tremendous suction . A real bargain . We like it better than our top rated Kenmore . 	Vacuum
Have had similar -LRB- in blue -RRB- model for 2 yrs now , and this is probably the hardest to use of all the vacuums we have had over the years . All the controls to adjust the height and bare floor or carpet are on the base and hard to switch . For instance my wife ca n't move the switch between bare floor and carpet , I have to do it . The heppa filter exhaust is a bad design as it blows the dust bunnies away from the front of the vacuum . It is the noisiest vacuum we have ever had . Hard to push on carpet compared with others I have had . For instance I have a 15 yr old Kenmore -LRB- which is actually a Panasonic -RRB- that is quiet and a joy to use that we relegated to the upstairs , that I 'm considering bringing back down again . You buy cheap , you get cheap . 	Vacuum
The vacuum is used by an assortment of people . Everyone who uses the unit appreciates the light wieght and ease of use . It does a good job and is easy to empty . It came with an extension cord that was not pictured but listed in the accessories section . Excellent value . 	Vacuum
We have 2 cats , one of whom constantly sheds 1-inch guard hairs . I estimate -LRB- from brushing him -RRB- that the amount he sheds per day is about as much as you can hold in your cupped hands . I found that after each run , the Roomba MUST be cleaned , and this takes a really long time since the cat fur gets stuck and wrapped around the brush 's gear shaft to the point where you need scissors to get them off . The fur also gets stuck on the brushes , causing the Roomba to stop picking up any more fur after a short while . All in all , it 's faster and MUCH less messy to just vacuum , than it is to clean the Roomba of cat fur after a single run . Although the Pet series Roomba may work well for dogs , I found it does NOT work well for cats . I regret having gotten this device . 	Vacuum
I 've been in the detailing biz for 30 years . . Have used just about every car vac that 's ever been produced at one time or another . . Most of them are pretty cheesy . . some are better than others . Most suck . . in a bad way . Due to that fact I generally just take my vehicles to the nearest car wash and use their industrial-strength vacs . Recently bought a Mini-Cooper and decided I wanted to keep a small vac on board . Did my usually anal research and decided on the Black & Decker PAV1200W ... Was not sure what to expect after reading both good and bad reviews . I think some peoples expectations are just too high . Was pleasantly surprised with this little device . The cord is plenty long . The accessories and bag are nice although I went to Griots Garage and bought a nicer bag for under $ 15 . The adjustability of the nozzle is sweet making it easier to get into hard places . The icing is the fold-up design which makes it easy to store in the car 's Lilliputian trunk . The little Black and Decker does a decent job of sucking up the small stuff and it 's just what I was hoping for . Do I wish it had more suction ? Absolutely , but for such a small device . . that would be unrealistic . If you 're expecting it too pick up pebbles , crayons , or shell casings . . it ai n't gonna happen . However . . I 'm very happy with mine for the day to day minor visual maintenance and I feel it 's well worth the money . 	Vacuum
Great vacuum . Does a good job cleaning and stands up to abuse very well . Outlasts and outperforms other similarly priced vacuums . Great\/cheap vacuum that you can use for a long time , then replace when it finally dies . 	Vacuum
I thought I already wrote a review of this vacuum , but it must have been on the Target site . Anyway , This is an excellent , powerful vacuum . We have a multi-cat household and I am always amazed at how much fur and -LRB- cat litter silt -RRB- get 's picked up . Granted , there is no bag so the back of the vacuum gets dust powder ... so a little leaks out when being used . The only con , I realized this past month . I decided to wash the filters ... not a good idea . I had to wash several times and bake in the sun , but the filters now stink ... very much . When I vacuum it smells like wet cat . Yuck ! So not a big deal ... I just realize that I have to buy new filters rather than wash them . Otherwise , I love my Bissell and highly recommend it !! 	Vacuum
I just bought several of these small , light vacuums for our community arts centers , and so far , we love them . They are light , and seem to have enough suction to do the job . I also like the reusable bag . What I do n't know yet is how well they will hold up over time , and that is important to us -- used to be an Electrolux fan , but over the decades , the machines have been made of cheaper materials , and they broke down and needed to be repaired way too often for the cost ; thus , we are switching to this Hoover model to try something new . The one thing that I would add to the current design to improv it is some way to keep all the attachments with the machine itself while you are vacuuming . Otherwise , so far , so good ! 	Vacuum
I totally love my hoover commercial shoulder vacuum cleaner . It is much easier to use then my old up right model . It does a better job & has a super long cord , so even in a larger house , you do n't need to switch plugs often . 	Vacuum
I thought I 'd finally found a vacuum that did n't easily clog -LRB- because the dirt path is more direct into the bag -RRB- and pretty much did what I wanted . However , as others have noted the plastic does break . The release mechanism from the locked upright position to allow vacuuming is difficult to operate and does not appear to be of a very good design . It eventually broke . When I called the `` 800 '' number about service I found the nearest warranty service is about 130 miles away even though Eureka lists nine major stores selling its products in town . The other problem I found is that you ca n't talk to a live person : Eureka provides one number for `` service '' with four options and pressing `` O '' wo n't do any good . This is getting so typical of many companies . I wo n't deal with this attitude so its going back ! 	Vacuum
This is a great vacuum . I had an old canister vac that totally blew ! Once we got this vacuum I realized how bad my old vacuum was . It is super easy to assemble . The first time I used it , I emptied the collector 3 times . It sucked up stuff that I did n't know was in my carpet . The attachments are easy to use . I only wish the cord was longer . It also cleans tile well . I am very pleased with my purchase . 	Vacuum
I debated buying this based on the reviews despite owning the handheld version and being extremely happy with it . We recently removed carpet and added wood flooring . We have 2 long-haired dogs that shed year round . You know those lovely collections of fur bunnies that form in the corners , under the chairs and against the walls and cabinets ? They have multiplied like rabbits and are extremely visible on the new floors . I needed a fast way to get rid of them without dragging out the corded vacuum twice a day . I found this unit to be all at once good , great and poor . It has a good battery life for what I use it for . I use it for 10 minutes every day . I experience no loss of power or suction . I did drain the battery to see how long it worked and 12-15 minutes was about it . That does n't sound like much but it is exactly what I need . It is great at picking up pet hair bunnies and dust\/lint on my wood floors . In less than 10 minutes I eliminate all the hair clutter on the wood floors around and under furniture AND any misc . shedding on my berber carpet traffic areas . Being able to go cordless from floor to carpet touchup is great ! I will say that I do n't appreciate that my dogs ' long fur wraps around the narrow brush as it cleans . I decided that simply cutting the fir off the brush after every few uses works well . It sounds silly but since all the fur bunnies are either in the filter or wrapped around the brush the job I got it for is getting done ! I do need to clean the filter after every use . It is surprisingly full in only 10 minutes of use . It is poor , however , at picking up debris that I would normally sweep up and get with a dustpan . If I sweep the floor first , if I have all the food crumbs , etc. in one spot and if I start vacuuming there , the debris is sucked up just fine . If I 'm vacuuming up fur bunnies first or along with debris this unit has just enough suction to get about 50 % of the accompanying debris all the way to the filter half way up the handle . It probably has to do with the hair wrapping around the brush . The bottom line for us ? We actually really like it and are glad we made the purchase . My need was to battle the fur bunnies daily and it does that extremely well . Getting fur off the top of the carpets in a snap was a bonus I did n't expect . However , if I were cleaning up under a toddler 's high chair it probably would be sent back . Maybe they should put pet hair pickup in the name somewhere . It excels at that ! 	Vacuum
This vaccumm worked ok the first couple of times I used it . Soon after the suction did n't work as well and it blows dust everywhere . I cleaned the filters , but no better . The hose wo n't even pick up a kernel of popcorn . Save your money . 	Vacuum
Heavier than I thought 10 lbs would be - I weighed it & 10 lbs . Awkward to empty the dust\/dirt . Does do well on floors & rugs\/carpet for an in-between vacuum but does not get edges as well as I hoped . I have only used a few times but the battery seems to charge ok -LRB- had read some complaints -RRB- . I bought this for a quick pick up & to use on the patio rug where I do n't use my house vacuum . It does bend easily going under things but still does n't get the edges . I have mostly wood floors and have to be careful when releasing to open - it pops open & will make dents in wood floors . It 's now 2\/11\/11 . The battery is still charging just fine . All of the filter system does require washing every few months if you use frequently . I have a puppy , live in FL -LRB- sandy even in the grass -RRB- so many trips in & out of the house . It seems to be a fine for in between clean ups before regular vacuuming & does a nice job on the patio rug & floor . I 've found hitting the edges from the front end , then side does work better - just a little more effort . Still overall pleased with the purchase . 	Vacuum
I wasted my money six months ago on a Hoover Tempo . It had been recommended by Consumer Reports which I am now starting to suspect of being highly biased towards certain brands ... since that Hoover Tempo was a piece of junk . I used it 20 times and the thing broke and became completely un-usable . I did n't even want to bother with the warranty . I 'm never going to consider Hoover for anything . I had fears before getting it due to some mixed feedback including some that were poor -LRB- how can this be a CR recommended product ... -RRB- . It was in-expensive so that made me try it out . Pure Garbage . I decided to check out Miele since my mother in-law had highly recommended it . I checked product reviews and they were great -LRB- aside from the high price tag -RRB- . This product is actually designed to last 15 years . I bet it will be the last vaccum I `` ll ever have to buy . This product is heavy , it 's built solid . If you need to do a lot of cleaning in stairs and you are not a strong person this may not be so appropriate . But for bare floors to carpet , this is unbelievable . I am so glad I got this . It also does n't take me much time to clean up . It sucks dirt so efficiently and quietly , it 's amazing . Filters may be expensive but who cares , this makes your house smell nice , very clean and quickly . Get the cheaper blue model . Who cares about how it looks ; it 's in the closet most of the time . I 'm not going to be posing for GQ while I vaccum . I give my highest ratings to this product . 	Vacuum
I do n't know how they rated this product so high . I never bought any vacuum like this before . Every single accessory is not able to stay on the behind . They dropped everywhere once unsing it including the hose . It was ended up in the trashtruck 1 month after I bought it . Thanks God I did it ! 	Vacuum
"We returned this vaccum . The hose is too long and will not stay in it 's place . It flops all over while you 're vaccuming . -LRB- Had to wind it around the front of the machine to keep it from coming undone . -RRB- The attachments fall out of their places as well , so you are always fiddling with them and the hose . The cord gets tangled up with the hose and attachments , so that 's another thing you have to stop and fix <ahref=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0015ASJIY/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/181-7033939-8402834""> Eureka 4870MZ Boss Smart-Vac Upright HEPA Vacuum Cleaner </a> . It seemed to pick up well , but all the adjusting and fiddling negated that . NOT a user friendly item . "	Vacuum
This is a well designed , powerful , medium-to-lightweight , versatile backpack vacuum , as other reviewers have said . I 've been using it for a little over a year and would purchase one again . Some important caveats : First , the Hoover dust brush that came with my vacuum is poorly designed and poor quality . The plastic bristles immediately collapse inward blocking most of the suction . I bought a Kirby real-bristle dust brush -LRB- $ 10 -RRB- , which fits right on the hose and works very well . Also , the combination floor tool that came with my vacuum is great for carpets , but I wanted a real floor brush to use on hardwood floors . When I contacted Hoover , I was told that the optional floor brush pictured in my manual is no longer available . I bought a Kirby floor brush -LRB- $ 25 -RRB- that fits snugly and works perfectly , protecting my wood floors . Finally , the Hoover or Royal BP paper bags are outrageously flimsy & overpriced -LRB- 7 for about $ 10 -RRB- . Despite frequent bag changes involving normal interior dust and dirt , nearly every bag I used split or tore , usually at the glued seam . This resulted in a filthy hypercone filter and a filthy , time-consuming cleanup job every time I changed bags . Over time , the dirt entering the inner chamber may also threaten the longevity of the vacuum motor . Shame on Hoover ; do n't they test their bags ? Anyway , to address this issue , you can double up on the paper bags , or use both a paper bag and the included cloth dust bag , with the paper bag over & inside of the cloth bag . I 've tried both options . So far , both options have prevented the inside paper bag from splitting w\/o seriously soiling the second paper bag or the cloth bag -- or allowing dirt to enter the interior chamber . Judging from the sound of the vacuum , it does n't seem to be straining or working harder with two bags , as long as I regularly replace the inside paper bag when it is dirty . With the paper bag inside the cloth bag , the cloth bag stays pretty clean and just needs a shake or two when I change bags . With two paper bags , the outside bag remains clean enough that I use it again when I change bags . 	Vacuum
This is a GREAT product ... easy to use and then put away in a corner ... highly recommend this vacuum !!! 	Vacuum
I really do n't understand what all you people are whining about giving this bad reveiews . The thing went together in like under a minute WITH an undersized screwdriver ! The hose is not too short , it 's just new . As far as it `` burning '' the floor when leaned on , DONT lean on it . For everyone who has ` super sensitive hearing ' ... it 's a vacuum , what do you expect ? There are much worse out there . Lastly , as far as the `` Horrible smell '' . There is a reason the instructions say to `` dry thoroughly '' . If the filters are damp , and you put them back in ... they will mildew . It 's not hard to figure out if you use a little common sense and READ THE DIRECTIONS . Companies spend lots of money researching these things so they generally are pretty correct if you follow the directions . People are really something . I give this vacuum 5 stars . Dare to think for yourself . 	Vacuum
I bought this after having problems with my previous Bissel bagless model , which lost its suction . This Eureka model works very well , has plenty of power , looks kinda cool , and has lots of attachments\/cleaning modes . Only downsides are : the foot release lock is sorta hard to push ; it 's kind of heavy , for a house with stairs ; it 's a tad loud ; the plastic body pieces are a little too hard and rigid and it seems they could break in a couple years . Overall I 'm very pleased with the purchase , after consulting Consumer Reports , etc. -LRB- I chose this over the blue Hoover model , which seemed just a little too cheap -RRB- . 	Vacuum
Great pick up , easy to use , bought both my sons one ! May buy another for myself , works great ! Good buy ! 	Vacuum
This is a little powerhouse of a vacuum ! I love the fact that the wand is made of metal . I 've had others that cracked especially at the connections . It clamps on nicely when you attach the accessories . The vacuum is light weight , compact and easy to maneuver around the house . I use it mainly for wood floors , stairs , upholstery and all those little areas . It does an excellent job on the upholstery which was the main reason I bought it in the first place . It has amazing suction , good air flow , and an extra long , heavy duty cord . It 's small enough that I keep the entire unit and all the accessories in a recycle bag hanging in my utility closet . I 'm so pleased with the value of this product . You wo n't be dissappointed ! 	Vacuum
Do n't give it a second thought -- If you want a fabulous hand held vacuum !!!!! This is the ticket-It 's great-My kids want to take it from me , so I 'll have to order two more - It 's so strong , and if you watch the video - you 'll see for yourself . It 's light and works really great ------ Amazon.com obviously does alot of research on the items they sell . 	Vacuum
I do n't c how everyone says it 's so great . Barely touches the wood floor for small pickup and ca n't really move around on carpet . I do n't even have pets . The suction is not strong at all . I was so anxious and excited to order , then was so dissappointed . True , the cord is long and it is light weight . But the rest is false information . 	Vacuum
WE got this sweeper at Kmart for $ 79.99 last year . It is a extra one we use downstairs in laundry room and basement . it is a very good sweeper for the money . In fact I like the extension hose much better then our Dyson animal which is very hard to use with the beater attachment . We lent it to our son and daughter in law to use while they are packing up and moving . They were very impressed with the suction it had . We told them to keep it and I am ordering another one today from Amazon . Free shipping and a 10.00 rebate . Who can beat that ? Do wish it had a longer cord and the beater brush turned off while you are using the beater extension on stairs -LRB- it will burn your carpet if set on the low setting so watch that -RRB- But i still think it is a great sweeper for the money . 	Vacuum
I ordered this vacuum based on Consumer Reports , concentrating especially on its ability to pick up pet hair . It works marvelously . My rugs are totally free of pet hair after I 've vacuumed . It 's a bit heavy , but I can live with that . The attachments are simple to work , and it 's easy to turn off the beater bar -LRB- for my more fragile handmade rugs -RRB- . It 's quiet , too . This is the best vacuum I 've ever owned . It came quickly and well packaged , and this was the best price I found anywhere . 	Vacuum
This is a great little vacuum ! It is the most powerful rechargeable vacuum I have ever used . The hose is just the right length , and the attchments are just what you want for this size vacuum . It 's very easy to see when it needs emptied , and is easy to empty . It 's very lightweight , and comfortable to carry around for extended peroids of time . It 's an all around great product . I am completely satisfied with the Flex Vac , would recommend for anyone . 	Vacuum
I am really impressed so far . The machine is so quiet and powerful , seems to have even more suction than my industrial vacuum in the garage . It seems well constructed of good quality materials . Compared to my other vaccuum -LRB- bissell upright -RRB- it is a Mercedes . I am always a bit concerned about longevity on imported products but so far not a single issue -LRB- few months owned -RRB- . Hopefully the bags are not prohibitively expensive cause they are also very well crafted with a look of high cost . The new machine came with two of them . The Unit works seemlessly on a multitude of surfaces . The ability to shut off the brush roll is wonderful for delicate rugs . The innovative swivel neck is something all vacuums of this size should have . 	Vacuum
The best Hand Vac I have ever owned . Compact , lightweight and Powerful . Has a Shop Vac like hose that extends to help you clean up high , low and in tight spaces . Also , it has a Pet Brush attachment that is the best solution I have used to clean my dog 's shedding hair . Great Buy ! 	Vacuum
Had this about a month now ... I purchased it for my studio apartment . If it works this well for a few years I will be completely happy . My last Hoover canister -LRB- not commercial -RRB- lasted me well over ten years . 	Vacuum
I have had this vacuum for about 1 year . I am looking for a new one currently . I have had to purchase a new belt every month . I just eats them up . It wasnt bad at first but over time it has gotten progressively worse . This month alone I have went through 4 belts . I got so frustrated yesterday I just threw it in the trash . 	Vacuum
I 've had this vacuum for almost a month and I can say i do n't have a real complaint about it . It made it through the holiday season picking up everything in its path , from Pine needles , screws , holly berries , food , confetti , and the such . The color scheme may not be the best , the aqua blue seems a little dated , and it has some bulk to it , but not much . It fits my needs and I 'm happy with it . 	Vacuum
I used this vacuum once or twice a month to vacuum regular carpet in three rooms . The motor gave out after a year and a half . Spend more money and get a better vacuum that will last longer . 	Vacuum
I 'm amazed anyone likes this . Have our standards gotten so low that we think this is a good - even an acceptable - product ? I bought it to vacuum my SUV . I charged it for about a week , then used it for the first time . It began to lose power after 3 minutes . As soon as it starts to lose power , it loses suction . At the 7 minute mark it was out of power . There is no power cord where you can plug it directly into an electical socket . There 's only a cord for recharging it . So unless your vehicle is clean enough where you only need 3 minutes with a vacuum - in which case , why bother cleaning it ? - do n't rely on this to do the job . Mine 's going back to the store . Too bad ... the attachments are nice , and the dust bucket is easy to empty . Then again , since it does n't have much suction , emptying the dust bucket is n't an issue . 	Vacuum
This product is a wonderful solution to the problem i had before . I was on a business visit to the US and was skepticle of buying any electronic stuff for the very fact that the power ratings of India and US are different . I made a very conscious decision of buying this product as it gets plugged into the car charger socket . Once i came back to India , once i started using this product , i couldnt stop myself from saying ` WOW ' ! . I then realized what an important and an amazing equipment i have gifted myself with . Sucktion power is super . The areas\/corners of the car which the vac can access to get rid of the dust is phenominal . I have not used any of its attachments coz ' i never wanted to . The default one is more than enough for the basic cleaning or for my purpose . Or i should say , i have used one one attachment i.e. brush one , to scrap off the mud one the carpet . Also , its not at all complecated to get rid of the collected dust . Just a button press and the lid opens to pore off the collected dust . I recommend this product for its compactness , sucktion power , length of the cord and its ease of usage . Please dont worry about the price . Its less only . But every penny is worth spending on this little genius . Well done ` Black and Decor ' ... ! 	Vacuum
I 've read the other reviews , and I can only say that this vacuum does NOT run for 20 minutes before losing its charge ... the response\/review from B&D states 7 minutes of continuous run time . I love the versatility of all the tools and the ease with which you can change them , but this vacuum 's running time is very short . We washed both of our cars today -LRB- and they were n't even really filthy inside -RRB- , and this vacuum did not have enough of a charge to even clean the interior of two cars . And it is constantly plugged in and charging when not in use . We had a Dustbuster for many years which was powered by the B&D VersaPak rechargeable batteries , but it finally died . We have other B&D small appliances and outdoor products which use the VersaPak batteries , and I know the batteries still can be purchased . However , Black & Decker no longer sells any of those products , only batteries . That Dustbuster was 100 % more reliable and powerful than this mini canister vacuum . Suggestion to Black & Decker : to avoid disappointed customers , perhaps you should consider printing the run time on your boxes . I 'm equally disappointed , for the same reason , with your blower and whip which we use for yard work . 	Vacuum
To keep my floors food free -LRB- no crumbs for the mice -RRB- I use this stick vac -LRB- PSV1800 -RRB- . Its great for small jobs done between my weekly vacuuming . Where do I use it ? On carpeting , hard floors and furniture . At first it was great on all surfaces , but after a few months its doing better on carpeting than hard floors . I tried to vacuum my small car with it , but its length makes that awkward . Although it folds , the fold is in the wrong direction to make it short enough to use in the car . << Edit Nov 2009 I took it apart recently when it stopped picking up altogether . I found that the filter was completely clogged . After I cleaned off the dust -LRB- the filter is re-usable -RRB- it worked a good as new ! So I recommend cleaning the filter every couple of months . >> I use it mostly in the kitchen , dining room and living room . I also use it in my entry way too to prevent dirt from being tracked all over the house . How 's the battery life ? Supposedly it will last 20 minutes . But I have n't run it for more than 5 minutes at a stretch , so the battery has n't died on me yet . Is it easy to use ? Yes , just unfold it and hit the on switch . However , it does require a little strength . It weighs only 5 pounds , but concentrated along a stick that could feel heavy . Its a little lighter than a gallon of milk -LRB- 8 pounds -RRB- . Emptying the dust , crumbs and dirt is a cinch . Its bagless , so you open a compartment and everything will fall out . I have n't had to reach in and scrape out dust yet . Cons The price keeps this vacuum from earning 5 stars . I do n't think its worth $ 100 . 	Vacuum
I have purchased so many vacuums through the years and I must say that this one is the best . I have two dogs , a golden and a mutt , that shed all year long . This vacuum has brought my carpet back to the original look . It really does clean both hard floor and carpet better than any vacuum I have ever used . 	Vacuum
The shipping was excellent and the vacuum was easy to assemble . It seems to work great and almost takes off without me . It 's a little heavy but it give me more of a work out right ? 	Vacuum
this vacuum is awesome it picks up just about everything ! although it needs to be thoroughly cleaned after each use . i highly recommend this vac 	Vacuum
This vacuum is pretty amazing . You do have to clean it out a lot , but that 's because it sucks up EVERYTHING . PROS turbo brush is awesome very good suction not too loud easy to clean CONS the hose is too short ... it ends up falling over on me when i vacuum the rugs with the turbo brush 	Vacuum
I am very pleased with this vacuum cleaner . This is actually my second purchase of the same product because I want to keep one on each floor of the house . It is heavy to lug up and down the stairs , but it does a great job cleaning the rugs . The hose accessory is great for the stairs . I am able to get alot of use out of this product . The first one I bought about 3 or 4 years ago and it is still running great . I have replaced the belts , etc. as recommended in the owners manual , but other than maintenance on it , it runs fine . I have not had any problems with it . 	Vacuum
I have had this vacuum for two days . Before this one , I had another almost identical Bissell which , in my opinion , was not old enough to have given out on me . I had taken care of the filters , and emptied the dust bin every time . I gave Bissell another try because I was familiar with it and I thought if the model was not good they would not continue making it the same exact way . I vacuumed once every day with the previous vacuum and it picked up everything visible and left nice vacuum marks , and to me that meant clean . I did n't know how wrong I was until I bought this one . I give this model 's initial suction power 5 stars . I was absolutely horrified at what came out of my carpets . Shocked . I went five swipes over the carpet and the bin was full , mostly of ultra-fine dust . I had to empty it 7 + times in my average-sized home at the initial cleaning . I vacuumed the whole house again and I noticed it was losing suction . I inspected and noticed that it was clogged , and when I tried to use the hose attachment , it was full of dust and came out all over the floor when I pulled it out . Same two problems with my previous Bissell . I have to take this one back to the store because it just is not good enough to hold up to normal use . I would have given the model 4 stars , taking responsibility for my own carpet being so filthy but then realized that the reason my carpets are as filthy as they are is because of the poor performance of my previous Bissell . The carpet was new when we bought this house , so Bissell 's performance is overall unacceptable . That is why this Bissell only gets 3 stars from me , and why I will not buy a Bissell again . When I saw how much dirt and dust came out at the initial cleaning , I said to myself , `` No wonder we 're always congested , sneezing , and sick . '' Not colds -- but allergies ! I did not want to invest much money in a vacuum -LRB- perhaps therein lies the problem ? -RRB- , but it looks like something exceptional is necessary . 	Vacuum
I 've only used it a couple of times ; so far , the vacuum seems to do a good job of cleaning . That said , the design is lousy . The on\/off switch and cord storage are lower than normal ~ ~ ~ only good if you 're sitting down ! Instead of having an opening in the front of the handle area to lift the vacuum , it 's in the back , making it very awkward , as the weight is in the front . The worst feature is that the diameter of the hose and wand attachment fit the turbo brush and other attachment , but not any attachments from the various other vacuums that I 've owned over the years . All of those other useful attachments and extenders that I 've accumulated wo n't work with this machine , severely limiting its usefulness . Prior to this , they were interchangeable with Kirby , Hoover , Oreck , TriStar , even my shop vac . If I had known that before opening the box , I would 've returned it . I 'm giving the vacuum to a college student , and will never buy another Bissell . 	Vacuum
I wish I had bought a non battery op small vac . runs 5 - 7 minutes Enough time to ??? do nothing 	Vacuum
In many ways , this vacuum is wonderful . It has great suction power , it works excellently on wood floors , and contrary to some reviews , it 's really not that loud . Much quieter than any upright I 've previously owned . As for the weight , it is on the heavy side , but not heavy enough for me to return it . Now for the bad . It 's difficult to push the reclining pedal . I mean , really , really hard . It 's also very difficult to change the setting tab from carpet to hardwood . I 'm always afraid it 's going to break because I 'm pushing it so hard . And , the attachments do n't stay put . They fall off from their stationary positions while I am vacuuming . I 've had this since mid-August , and today the hose broke . I was quite disappointed . It 's the reason I finally replaced my Panasonic vaccuum , because I 'd replaced 2 hoses on it . Overall , for the $ 118 I paid for this , I 'd say you get what you pay for . It suctions well , which is the most important thing . And for it 's size , it gets into the corners really well , better than most . I do n't have pets , so I ca n't attest to how well the Power Paw works . 	Vacuum
I love the ipod . I think the design is sleek and very easy to use . Each button has multiple uses . It 's very fast and the sound quality is clear . It does n't skip like how old portable cd players do . I use mine at the gym all the time now . I loaded all my music straight from my Itunes on my computer at work . It was very easy . I would recommend this iPod if you have a lot of music ! 	Video Player
Even though I thought that I would never be able to justify spending so much money on one of these , I have had mine for only a few weeks and have already began to see how useful it can be . I was a little concerned that I would n't be able to find much on i-tunes of the genre I listen to most -LRB- Classical -RRB- , but I was pleasantly surprised . The sound , by the way , is also quite good , and I appreciate the handiness of being able to load pretty much all the music I own onto it and to have it so easy to access . Also , though I admit that it took me a little time to be able to figure out how to use it , it actually was not too complicated once I was able just to sit down and fiddle with it . So on the whole , I would say that it was a pretty good purchase and that I feel barely any remorse for finally splurging on one ! 	Video Player
my mom ordered this for my birthday . i was really impatient and the original estimated date was later than my birthday . also , my brother got something else that had a closer estimated date . so , on may 5 , we drove in and i only saw one package ... my brother 's ... but then i saw another one underneath ! it was my ipod !!!! the delivery is extremely fast and reliable ... also , the ipod works seamlessly with itunes and im still new at this ... the ipod is a great product worth its money . its an abosolute must for music lovers !

I 'm not a particularly high-tech user of this device and have to admit that it 's probably over-engineered for my needs . But the Creative Zen Vision : M 30 GB MP3 and video player caught my eye when I was shopping for an iPod , and since it rated so highly in the tech reviews I decided to buy it . My main interests are listening to albums and books , and being able to put photos of my family and friends under the nose of anyone who looks as if they might stand still for it . The Creative does all that perfectly and I could n't be happier . Downloading and organizing my files is a cinch . I have n't got much video loaded but I can see that for my needs I 'll never run out of space . I 'm amazed at the crisp screen definition ! You can see every twinkle in my granddaughters ' eyes . Another big plus for me is the length of time this little object of desire plays on a single charge , especially playing audio . I 've never had to charge it in the car , it just plays and plays . The controls are easy to use and the bookmarking is very easy -- helpful to me when listening to books . My Creative Zen : Vision just looks and feels good and I take it everywhere with me . A year ago I 'd have said this technology was n't for me . I 'm SO glad I changed my mind ! 	Video Player
It was brand new , and other than having some difficulty getting used to itunes -LRB- I 've used winamp for years -RRB- I 've had absolutely no problems whatsoever . I 've already started looking into accessories for it , including a protective case , and it 's got over a 1,000 songs already ! I love it ! I have n't put any movies or videos on it yet , but that 's only because I have no idea how to do it . Thankfully my brother is a pro with these things , and plans on putting a bunch of stuff on it for me !! 	Video Player
As soon as the Apple iPod Video hit the market , reviews about it came flooding in . I do n't own an MP3 player , and I have never used one . When I found that there was a device that could play video and was ultra portable , I knew I had to find out more . I read a NY Times review about the Apple ipod Video in comparison to its competitors . Brands mentioned were iRiver and Archos . I looked into both , but discovered that the Archos had better features and were better priced . Then , I landed with the Archos av420 . Basically , this is a complex handheld device -LRB- approximately the size of a palm pilot -RRB- that has the ability to play movies -LRB- avi , divx , xvid , and others -RRB- record video files off the TV , VCR or DVD player , SCHEDULE recording sessions , -LRB- just like a portable Tivo ! -RRB- store photos and data , PLAY MP3 's . You can read all the perks above and take the product tour , which says all this , so I am going to discuss my reaction to the product . PROS : I could use this thing as soon as it came out of the box . Essentially , after charging the battery , you can plug it into your computer -LRB- PC or MAC through USB 2 -RRB- and drag and drop files onto the device . It is THAT easy . Files copied very quickly , it took less than a minute to copy the movie `` The Notebook '' from my computer 's hard drive onto the Archos av420 . How do you get these files ? You have two options : you can record movies from your TV , VCR or DVD 's , or you can download files from the internet that you can play on the Archos , just like downloading MP3 files . The device has a crisp and clean screen , it is light and very sturdy feeling , and it COMES WITH headphones and all the various cables you 'll need . I found it EASY to use and navigate , but be warned that recording takes time , as does copying DVD 's . CONS : Too many cables . There are tons of different cables , the most annoying come from the dish that connects to the TV . Keep your cables organized , and you should n't have a problem . Besides that , this is an excellent product with a wide range of files available , unlike its competition , the Apple iPod Video . If you want something that can be used for portable video and music and photos , this is the gadget to get . I adored mine as soon as I got it plugged into my computer . I could n't get over how nice the images were , and how EASY to use it really was . Literally , DRAG AND DROP . If you are confused by file formats or do n't know how to download files , this is NOT the device for you . I was downloading movies and video files before I got this device , and now I can bring those files with me when I travel or go to work . It is much more convinient to use this than my personal DVD player , and takes up a 10th of the space in my backpack . Thank you technology ! 	Video Player
I bought this to replace a 200 disk cd changer , and I 'm really glad I did . My son has been moving all our cd content to the iPod through the computer , and I figure we could put at least 450 cd 's worth of music on there . The upload automatically loads in the artist , song title , and album name . We can set it on shuffle , and we 're good to go for a LONG time . We bought the Kensington iPod dock , and aside from a volume issue that seems to have resolved itself , this combo is working out great . Now there 's a huge gap where the old player was , with this tiny iPod sitting there . I like that it 's so easy to take the iPod out to my shop where I 'm working . That would be awkward with the old player , to say the least . We do n't have it set up in our cars yet , but we will soon . 	Video Player
We where very happy with the way that it worked out . We wished it would have came with a manuel , but oh well . Thank 	Video Player
This is my first iPod and I have to say I 'm impressed with the quality in craftsmanship , sound and ease of use . iTunes installed without any problems , and it is easy to manage your files . Lots of people do n't like iTunes , but it seems to have a wide variety of stuff in it , and I have n't had any problems using music files I 've gotten from Limewire . The earphones included sound very good , although they wo n't stay put if you 're jogging . I 'm using my iPod in `` manual mode '' so it gives me more control of managing my files , and it prevents deleting something accidentally . I take one star away because of the limited VIDEO file types that can transfer to the iPod . You may be able to convert and watch some non-iTunes videos , but you might lose the sound . 	Video Player
I am very pleased with my new archos mp3 AV 420 is simply fantastic 	Video Player
I have just got this player and I will say right now that is awesome . It is able to pretty much everthing that an I-Pod can except for games . If you dont mind not having games , then this player is twice as good as its sister player the I-Pod . The main object that sets it apart is the fact that it has a built in FM radio and microphone . The recording quality is amazing . The screen is the same size as I-Pod 's but it is clearer . another great function is the way you dont have to use I-Tunes . It uses windows and any MP3 formated song . Video playback is awsome . compatible formats such as : WMV9 , MPEG1\/2\/3 \/ 4-SP , Motion JPEG , DivX and Xvid . The battery life for video is about 2x lnger than that of the I-Pod . Photo campatiable also and able to compose slide shows . With an Audio\/Video out cable -LRB- comes with most new DVD players -RRB- you can easily plug the player right in to your TV . Simple and easy to use and not to mention $ 50 less than the 30gb I-Pod video it is a great player that can hold all of you media . Amazon.com seems to be the cheepest place to find one at about $ 250 . 	Video Player
This device is so much better then the iPod , I has many features that the iPod dose not and I have always been a big fan of Creative Labs . They have been doing sound longer then any computer company out there . 	Video Player
I love the Zen Vision M. I use it to teach fitness classes and it has made a big difference ! The sound and video quality is great . BUT the pink is obnoxious Peptobismo pink , not the soft pink that is pictured . I really wish I had chosen a different color ... Oh well , at least no one will steal it . 	Video Player

I had first decided to go with a much cheaper brand mp3 player , it had more space and did the exact same thing as the ipod ... or so I thought . I had it for about 1 & 1\/2 months before it just stopped working . I was mad , because the company would n't replace it , and said it must have been something I did . Well I know it was n't md , because I only used it in my apartment with some speakers I bought with it , I just left it on a shelf . I kicked my self in the rear for that one . So I decided to spend a little more and get the ipod second time around . I love this thing , the software is really simple to use -LRB- which is great , because I 'm not overly tech . savvy . I bought the armband for it too , which is awesome if you like to work out with music . It 's very comfortable and it does n't get in the way . The battery life is pretty good too . I have the aux . hook up in my car and I took it on a road trip from Pennsylvania to Florida and I still had some battery when I got there , before having to charge it again -LRB- that was about a 15 hour drive -RRB- . There are so many cool accessories for this that it seems no matter where you take your ipod -LRB- work , road trip , gym , home audio system -RRB- you can find anything you could possibly need to play\/charge it . With the other mp3 player I bought I could n't find 1\/4 of what the ipod has . Not to mention , that when you purchase tunes off the online ipod store there only 0.99 cents a song . This works out great if you only like one or two songs off an album . I say apple hit a home run with this , and so did Amazon . I did standard shipping and they got it to me within 3 days ! Did I mention that I love my ipod ?! 	Video Player
The Creative Zen Vision is everything I could ask for in an MP3 player . It is easy and inuitive to use . It supports all formats and has not given me an ounce of trouble for the 2 months that I have had it ! I love this product . 	Video Player
The sound is spectacular in the earbuds provided , sounds like surround sound . You can keep your iPods !! The picture on the screen is also superior to the iPod , and the program to load music into it is so easy , you do n't need itunes -LRB- at a dollar a song -RRB- like the iPod . You can also load programs that you normally watch and that are saved on Tivo , also movies from the computer . I love my Zen , best purchase I 've made . 	Video Player
I can only assume that the people who made this so-called `` MP3 Player '' actually intended it to be some sort of baffling puzzle . Your first clue that this is indeed a puzzle and not an MP3 player is that the earbuds are just terrible . Just absolutely bottom-of-the-barrel , cheapest pieces of crap you 've ever stuck in your ears . `` Why would an MP3 player clearly not want you to be able to hear the music ? '' you 'll ask yourself . Then you 'll note that the whole thing feels like it was made out of matchsticks and the weight of the device was all in the packaging . Then you 'll attempt to touch the so-called `` touch screen '' and something random will happen . Icons seem to be taunting you with their touchability , as they scream out `` Touch me ! I 'm all glowy and appropriately-placed on the screen ! I 'm just begging for it ! '' But try as you might , touching them accomplishes nothing or something random that you would never want . Rarely will a song play if you want it to . You 'll get frustrated and try to `` Calibrate '' the d \*\*\* thing only to find the touch screen works perfectly . You 'll be confused . You 'll return it to the giant electronics store from which you purchased it . You 'll open up the replacement one and find the exact same list of problems . And then it dawns on you : this is a puzzle . It ca n't be bad design , asinine programing , and astoundingly cheap manufacturing . No one is that incompetent . No , it MUST be a puzzle . Surely solving this puzzle will transport me to another universe where I will learn new things about others and myself as I battle evil wizards and fight off space invasions . Any time now .

I 've had this item for two weeks now and I still can not resolve the issue of it not recognized by both my desktop and laptop . Technical support through e-mail is frustrating because it takes forever . I guess my unit is just a lemon since all the reviews here are all positive and in the up and up . 	Video Player
I really liked the Zen for the first month . It is easy to use , the sound and video are great . But then I noticed that the screen was getting scratched up even though I had been carefull with it . So it scratches really easy . Today it appears to have failed and it will not recover . I see that others have had similar problems with it and will be calling Creative to see what I must do . Also , the Zen came with a free subscription to Napster that ended up costing us money even though we were carefull to follow the instructions to avoid charges . 	Video Player
In my opinion ; Creative audio\/video players are the best on the market in terms of value , performance , and features . These traits outweigh the aesthetic qualities of the ipod . What first impressed me with the Vision M was the quality of the screen ; it is very bright , the abundance of colors is amazing and the backround customization is great . The navigation system is a little tedious at first , but it becomes a breeze after a little practice . The best thing I like about this player is the fact that it supports a large array of video\/audio formats . I was able to transfer my video and music files easily . In regards to performance , the playback was perfect . I was able to watch a full length video and still have plenty of juice left to listen to music . The sound quality of the music was very impressive , -LRB- 97 db SNR -RRB- , add to the fact that you can use Custom EQ to tweak it to your liking . The only drawback with this device is the screeen scratches easily , but as one reviewer pointed out , you can use PDA screen protectors to preserve the screens finish . Other than this ; the player is perfect . If you 're looking for a product that will play your music and video files flawlessy and more , then this is the player for you . It is a better choice than the ipod and your dollars will go a lot furthur with this investment . 	Video Player
This is a great product and it 's fun . Not to mention it looks awesome and cool . But the only thing I totally hate about ipod videos is the battery life . The more and more you charge it and the older your ipod gets , the shorter the battery life . I ca n't even listen to music for 30 minutes without the battery life almost completely dying . 	Video Player
My son loves his iPod , great buy , and it looks great . Thank you . 	Video Player
great product . What else is there but fine music to accompany your daily activities , and this does it . well made , pretty easy to program , and holds lots of stuff . The sound is fantastic . My only complaint is about the ear phones . If you have small ears , as I do , they are not comfortable , and you lose sound because they do n't fit snuggly in the ear . But on the whole , it is a fanastic invention that has enriched my life . 	Video Player
I used to be one of those iPod haters . I could n't understand why anyone would ever spend upwards of 250 bucks for a mp3 player . And then pay a dollar for every song you wanted . I finally decided to give the 30 GB a chance , and boy was I suprised . I already had my music on my computer so all I had to do was import it to iTunes . I 've been going everywhere with my iPod now . I 've got over 1,000 songs on it , a Dave Chappelle special , 12 different Comedy Central stand-ups , the first season of 24 , and four movies on it with some room to spare . It is a music player first and a TV\/DVD player second , but it 's perfect for what I need . I do wish that it was a little more scrach resistant -LRB- specifically the screen -RRB- and it had an FM tuner in it , but considering everything else it has in such a small size , it 's quite impressive . Selling my soul to the Apple was n't as bad as I thought it would be . iPod has turned into the New England Patriots for me ... I used to hate the Patriots , but I started to respect how good they always managed to be -LRB- those jerks -RRB- . You have to respect how apple has demolished the competition . 	Video Player
I bought this for my daughter and she loves it , it does so many things and holds all her music and videos and music videos . Great sound and picture , ear phones did n't last as long as we would of liked but everything else is great 	Video Player
I was skeptical at first , because it seemed that the entire population was buying Ipods , but then , i decided to give this cheap alternative a try . Basically , it does everything an Ipod Video can PLUS radio and extended battery life . ca n't get any better than that . 	Video Player
Product arrived on time and as described . This would be what I consider a budget video player . Although , it states it is a `` HD Video '' player , it certainly does not look the part . The unit is a fairly straight forward set up , so it is very user friendly . 	Video Player
I bought this with 2 expectations . Good sound\/image quality and long battery life . They both passed with flying colors . Also , this product has the capability to import AVI , and DivX files and read them through the easily managable file management program with the unit . Lightweight design , excellent menu system and interface . Only downfall , is it locks-up occassionally-have that paperclip ready . But the lock-ups are the fault of crappily edited AVI files . Unlike the Ipod which supplies nothing except directions to download Itunes which is anal , this product has it all and is of great value $ -LRB- ... -RRB- or -RRB- . Get it . 	Video Player
I like it because of its functionality and capacity . It is easy to work with . But for running its kind of heavy . 	Video Player
I 'm a late-comer to the the whole MP3 thing . I 've been putting off buying one for a variety of reasons -LRB- cheapness , techno-phobia , my CD Walkman never broke -RRB- but my tax return came in , and what else am I going to do with $ 300 ? I 've never owned an iPod , but many of my friends do and have , and I was hesitant to get one based on their problems with it -LRB- notably , as everyone else has said , battery power -RRB- . So , I got this one and I 'm quite pleased with it . The Zen comes with everything you need to use it -LRB- e.g. a charger , headphones , etc -RRB- . I bought new headphones because I hate ear buds , but the ones included had decent sound quality -LRB- typically , `` freebie '' headphones are awful -RRB- . Other than that , the only other investment I made was protective film for the screen -LRB- $ 15 for 12 sheets -RRB- . If you want to get a cover for the whole thing , buy one on line . I tried at least 4 local stores -LRB- big chains -RRB- and NO ONE carries accessories for Zens . The screen has pretty amazing resolution for a 21\/2 inch screen . I have n't watched any videos on it yet , aside from the sample ones that are loaded on the player when you get it . Maybe I 'm easily impressed . But the picture is sharp and clear and the colors are vibrant . I 'm currently in my 13th hour -LRB- literally -RRB- of ripping my CD collection onto my Zen and I 've only used 4 GB of memory . Each CD takes just a few minutes , even less if you already have them saved on your computer -LRB- you can drag and drop them from your My Music file -RRB- . The only complaint I have has to do with the software that comes with it . After about every 10th CD , it had some sort of error -LRB- again , I have no idea what kind of error as I 'm lucky to have gotten this far -RRB- . It 's not a big problem , because it takes about 3 seconds to get around it , but it 's kind of annoying . The player itself could n't be easier to operate . So far , no problems -LRB- knock on wood -RRB- . UPDATE !!! The Bad News : Okay , so five days after I got my Zen , after 36 hours burning my entire CD collection onto it , it died . Yeah . Fried . Everything gone . Heartbroken , I called Creative . I did n't have to wait for someone to pick up , and I received instant , helpful and friendly assistance . Unfortunately , I had to send it back and was told it would be 10-15 business days before I would get another one -LRB- or mine if they could fix it -RRB- . The Good News : After only 6 business days , I have my new Zen . So , that 's awesome , except that I now have to reburn everything -LRB- TIP : burn your CDs to your computer , if you have the space , and then copy them to your Zen ... it 's a good idea in case this happens -RRB- . Creative 's customer service was great . 	Video Player
This player is great ! Previous to this I lived through the nightmare of owning an over-priced iCrap Nano and this beats it hands down . Best price for a player of this size anywhere , easy to use , attractive , and versitile . 	Video Player
I 've had this for a day , and I just ca n't stop fiddling with it . It has so many options and things to do ! It 's not just an iPod it 's an entertainment machine !

Bought this one from freund5373 as a revised working I-Pod . Unfortunately the sad face keeps showing up , after synchronising and resetting no luck what so ever .

The Zen had nice asthetics but did n't work well . The program required to make the player work was difficult to navigate through and failed to continue funtioning after a short time . When I tried logging on to the Website to find a customer service link . That did n't exist . So next time I will buy an IPOD from a store where I can get '' customer service '' if need be . I have several friends with IPODS and they are all happy with the functionality and if something goes wrong there is a big retailer ready to stand behind the product . When I purchased the Zen , I thought I was saving $ 50.00 I was actually throwing away $ 260.00 because it does n't work and there is n't a contact person to help me fix or reconfigure the program to make the Zen work again . So I threw it in the garbage last week . This weekend I 'm off to P.C. Richards to get an IPOD . 	Video Player

I bought the Zen Vision M 30Gb to show videos in class where I teach . Its functionality , price and ease of use proved to me yet again how marketing overwhelms everything in contemporary America ! At well under half the price for similar devices that do n't do half as much or have a quarter of the memory , this device held , converted and played all types of vids via an a\/v hookup to my tv at home and the projection-style media set-up at my campus . The fact that it also has an FM radio , plays music files , stores pics and other types of data , and comes with good support software makes it far superior to things like the iPod and other devices . Yet even hard-core techies at my job have never heard of it , Creative Zen or knew that many features could be had for the price I paid . Prisoners of the marketers ! No matter ; their ignorance and willful adaption to advertising hype helps keep great products like this a real bargin . 	Video Player

I hesitantly ordered this iPod after a year of debate . My kids had previous generations of the iPod and experienced freezes and some annoying glitches so I was a little nervous . I finally took the plunge and am glad I did ! I have to say that so far I have been extremely pleased with the performance . The controls are easy to use -LRB- even with the eVo iSkin I purchased for it in place -RRB- and the newly designed earbuds are comfortable as well . The only drawback I have noticed is that the sound is somewhat tinny at increased volumes . That would not be enough for me to not purchase this iPod . I LOVE IT ! 	Video Player
My First ipod and I am very happy . It wanted to buy the new Zune , but , when seeing many reviews that ipod video surpassed it by : comfort , forms , weight , size , drive interphase ... I am very happy with it , only the bad thing is the Itunes , is something hard to use ... White Ipod Rox !!! The other great mp3 player option is Creative . 	Video Player
It arrived promptly and works like a charm . I 'm sure my wife will love it ! 	Video Player
Nothing less to say about my new iPod . This is my 3rd one for the record . The screen crystal clear . easy navigation . blah . . blah . It is good . integration with Itunes makes it easy to load all your digital media . But I am still waiting to see full screen with virtual click wheel . I recommend this for any one looking for a PMP . 	Video Player
I have a lot of experience with MP3 players , having owned many Creative Zen players over the years . So , when it was time to upgrade and retire my older players , I wanted to find one with Bluetooth capability and the ability to play music saved on MicroSD cards . Using MicroSD cards allows me to carry all my music -LRB- hundreds of albums -RRB- with me while traveling , without having to put all the music directly into the MP3 player 's internal memory . After checking the information available for Creative 's Zen M300 , I decided to give it a try . Although it had all the features that I wanted and more , it did something that was very annoying for me . Specifically , it played the tracks from my albums -LRB- each album in separate file folders -RRB- off the MicroSD card in alphabetical order . I experienced this problem once before -LRB- with the Creative Stone MP3 player -RRB- and have never understood it . Why would any player be programmed to play tracks alphabetically instead of by track number ? I get the idea of playlists . But , sometimes , you just want to put an album in your player -LRB- so to speak -RRB- and listen in order -LRB- like a CD ... or even a record ! -RRB- . This is especially important if you listen to classical music and operas , in addition to all the other music that you like . So , I wrote to Creative tech support , and they quickly responded noting that this could not be changed with this player ; they suggested looking into the Touch2 which uses the Android operating system . I liked this idea , owning 2 Creative ZiiO tablets -LRB- with Android 2.2 -RRB- and enjoying them and their ability to play music in proper order right off the SD cards . So , I sent back the Zen M300 and ordered the Creative Zen Touch2 . Now , I 'm very pleased . First , it was a breeze to set up . The Android 2.2 operating system is easy to navigate and works really well . Like I noted earlier , I have a lot of experience with this OS from the ZiiO tablets . There are a few differences , but nothing significant . The touch screen works very well , although it takes a little practice and time to get used to the feel and amount of pressure needed . It was very easy to set up the wireless connection and then to connect to the internet . I 've worked around google play by using Amazon 's App store in the past . It worked great with the Touch2 as well . Connecting the Bluetooth to my headphones and wireless speakers was simple and fast . And , as expected from Creative 's MP3 players , the sound is fantastic . Oh , and I almost forgot to emphasize that it reads the tracks in order to track number , not alphabetically with the installed player . If I wanted something more elaborate , there are plenty of music players that I could download from Amazon or another site using the WiFi and browser . Battery life has been good so far ; I own a Creative universal MP3 charger which allows me to use an electric outlet instead of my computer 's USB . I read other reviews that spoke about the player freezing up a lot . My player initially was frozen after the first charge for some unknown reason ; I used a pin to reset the player -LRB- next to the MicroSD card slot -RRB- , and it started with no problem . There 've been no other freezing up problems since . I think the updated firmware -LRB- which was already installed on my player -RRB- should help the earlier versions to fix this problem . Overall , I 'm very pleased with this new Creative MP3 player , which now uses Android and allows internet access , in addition to playing my music properly . 	Video Player
This is the fourth Crative mp3 player our family has owned . With the other three I was able to easily make a playlist and import it to the player . Unfortunately with this player I have n't been able to import the playlist from Windows Media player nor the program player that is supposed to be used . The only way to get the playlist on the player is to individually add each one on the player . If anyone has any idea on how to import the playlist from my computer or windows media player it would be greatly appreciated . 	Video Player
At first I hated iPod -LRB- something to do with my first one literally blowing up -RRB- But I gave it another chance , and to my surprise , it 's been working great . I give the actual product 5 stars , but I loathe iTunes , seeing as how I had to delete all my music from it since I ran out of memory on my HD . Luckily you 're able to set it to manual sync , meaning your iPod wo n't automatically sync the content currently on your iTunes account , or in my case LACK of content . It 's inevitable , but I 'm gonna have to eventually upload all my albums again . A simple `` load content from iPod to iTunes '' feature would do wonders for me . 	Video Player
Update : Still using it in 2012 although I think it will die soon . Sometimes I have to reboot . \*\*\*\* I originally purchased my Creative Zen Vision : M in February 2006 . I did have a problem with that particular model after about a year but was able to get it replaced very easily through customer service . The one I have now has given me no problems . I use it to listen to music , record interviews , watch movies on planes and have even used the radio when a bartender refused to turn up the sound on a game we were watching . I am now a big fan of creative and when it 's time to upgrade , I will probably go with Creative again rather than the Ipod . I love that it can take multiple file formats and I can use Amazon unbox to download tv and videos . As a surprise for my husband , I downloaded a classic episode of WKRP in Cincinnati for him to watch on a trip and he LOVED it . The battery life has exceeded my expectations . To give a fair review , I would say that it is unfortunate that all of the third party products designed for the Ipods are not available for the Creative , but it probably saves me some money .

This has been the best purchase I have made in a long time . With the extra purchase of a Sony tape and power adapter -LRB- can get it at Target or Amazon -RRB- , I can hook up my player to my car and play all my MP3 through the car speakers . I can even have the audio of the movies play through the car speakers and watch the video w \/ the travel cables hooked up to a portable TFT screen -LRB- you can get both through the Archos web site or Amazon -RRB- . You can do the updates from the Archos web site . With the updates , the device allows you to switch back in forth from a Windows Device to a Hard Drive -LRB- it tells you how where you download the updates -RRB- . You want to install the updates before you put anything on the device , because it formats the drive . When it is set on Windows device , you can synchronize songs -LRB- MP3 and WMA -RRB- with no problem . When it is set on Hard Drive , you can send your . AVI files back and forth . I copy Movies off the TV -LRB- or On Demand for Cable users -RRB- and then save them on my PC and it frees up room on the device . My computer has an 80g drive so I can put just the ones I want w \/ out having to rerecord them . You do not even have to sit and watch the device record . You can set the timer on the device to record and even when to cut off . There are also sites that you can download AVI movies for a small fee . I copy my DVD 's and VHS also . Whatever is showing on my TV shows up on my device . You can see what is being recorded on the device . I have also been able to play my music back through my TV when I do not want to put the headphones on . Now if they could just combine this w \/ a PDA it would be even better . 	Video Player
Creative makes a good , solid product , and the Zen Vision M player continues this tradition of quality . The Zen is available in 30 or 60 GB . I chose the 30 GB size feeling it would more than meet my needs at a more affordable price . I have not come close to utilizing all that memory . My songs are organized in user-created playlists such as easy listening , workout , movie themes etc. . The player 's navigational touch pad is hyper - sensitive , making any menu browsing slightly challenging . The Zen can easily be connected to the stereo through AV cables -LRB- sold separately -RRB- . The Zen also has an FM radio that auto selects and programs available stations . It was not , however , able to select my favorite station -LRB- weak signal -RRB- , and gives no manual controls for me to select it myself . Includes video features , and easily interfaces with subscription sites such as Napster . Comes is a variety of cool colors . Excellent battery life . I really enjoy my Zen Vision M. 	Video Player
I previously bought a creative zen micro from amazon and i absolutley love it . I cant get enough of it . I listen to it every possible minute i can . Ive had this for about a year and a half , and i saw that creative came out with the vision m. I did hours of research on it . I compared it to the IPod video , and decided that the vision m was the mp3 video player for me . My dad has an IPod video and he loves it , but recently the hard drive crashed on him . I ordered the vision m in white because the black really shows finger prints and scratches . I ordered this product on March 28 and today is April 28 . Amazon still hasnt shipped this product , and I payed extra for express shipping . I am getting extremely impatient , but from what i hear `` good things are worth waiting for '' 	Video Player
I like pretty much everything about Zen , except sometimes I have to reset it , because it stalls when playing some video files . 	Video Player
Epson makes the claim that , `` it 's easy to share your favorite photos , videos and music '' on this device . This device is wonderful for viewing photos but do n't make the mistake of thinking you 're going to watch videos on it like you can on an ipod video . They make the claim you can `` show your friends your video '' - well-you can but not with sound synchronized . I created multiple video files and followed all the instructions that came in their manual , i.e. , file extensions , video codec , audio codec , etc. . The videos look beautiful but the sound refuses to synchronize and always lags by a few seconds . The first time I called customer service -LRB- not a free number -RRB- I waited a long time and was transferred multiple times and finally ended up talking to a woman with a very thick East Indian accent -LRB- almost incomprehensible -RRB- who did n't have a clue what she was talking about . It was obvious she had n't been trained . The second time I called , I got a guy who told me that yes , Epson has a problem , that it really was n't made for video and all he could do was apologize . I have loved Espson printers and always trusted Epson in the past , but they really snookered me on this one . 	Video Player
First off let me say I have experimented with the iPod Video -LRB- friend got it for Xmas -RRB- and generally liked it . Just for my needs , it was n't the right choice . I use XP mainly and wanted more video and song compatibilty options . After much research -LRB- iAudio X5 , iPod Video , and others -RRB- the Vision : M came out on top . Now that I 've received mine and had a chance to play with it some , I think it 's obvious by some of the alleged `` reviews '' posted by obvious iPod fans , they really have n't even tested this excellent unit . Some highlights : 1 - works with the subscription based music services , which was high on my list . iTunes may someday offer this option , but at least for now does not . I like to try out all kinds of music before purchasing and can do it with this portable media player -LRB- PMP -RRB- . Sound quality for music is very good , with an EQ to tweak to individual tastes . 2 - video quality is top notch , with several different formats supported . It was quite easy to transfer recordings from my Snapstream PVR setup on the PC to the Vision : M , so now I have several episodes of The Simpsons , Scrubs , and 60 Minutes to watch during trips . Nice . 3 - The menu navigation is just like the Creative Zen Micro , and I think most people will get the hang of that relatively quickly . It 's not perfect but I had it pretty much down in the initial hour of playing around with the unit . OTHER INFO : I have n't had a chance to play video for a long stretch to determine true battery life , but specs and reviews on sites like CNET indicate it is about 4 hours for video and 14 or so for music . That is plenty for me . iPod is more in the 2-3 hour range for video . As for size , I 've seen some who make a big deal that it is thicker than the iPod Video . However , the Zen feels solid and comfortably fits in my hand . I have no problem at all with the size . It 's plenty small . I 've noticed some people claim Creative has ripped off iPod for the look , but really , the Creative Zen Micro MP3 player -LRB- about 2 years old -RRB- is what struck me as a near replica as far as size\/design goes . Similar to iPod Video , sure . But far closer to Creative 's already long established MP3 player . Features like microphone recording , FM play and record , Outlook calendar \/ contacts compatibility , etc. are nice little bonuses but were n't a real factor in my selection criteria . With the upcoming vast increase in choices for video , podcast and music download availability -LRB- as evidenced by recent announcements at CES and elsewhere -RRB- , the Zen Video : M should be a great choice for anyone who rates features\/quality over the `` hipness '' factor iPod currently has over the masses . I give Apple credit for how they achieved their iPod success with great marketing and a solid product , I just think if you do your research you may end up choosing the Video : M as well . I would n't hesitate at all to steer a Windows XP user to it . P.S. Tested out the ZenCast feature -LRB- in beta as of my writing -RRB- and it shows promise as a way to collect video and audio podcasts from a centralized location . Creative Zen Video : M gets a big thumbs up from me ... 	Video Player
When I got it , I downloaded 3000 songs easily . I went back to download more and the computer would not recognize the USB cable . I tried 4 different computers and 3 different cables , no dice . I tried calling customer service and I got hung up on several times and then got a busy tone -LRB- it is a 1-300 number -RRB- The only other thing is a discussion forum . I downloaded all the new drivers and programs that it said to do . . still does n't work . This is a great product as far as sound , visuals etc , but if it breaks or doesn ; t work , be prepared for some crappy customer service . 	Video Player
Refurbished version was great , looked brand new , was very satisfied !! Will definitely order from them again . everything neatly packaged and worked like new . 	Video Player

Pros : -- Great capacity and media abilities -- Stable environment -- Good controls -LRB- takes a little while to get used to but very flexible once you do -RRB- -- Easy software as well as many software options -LRB- not limited to iTunes -RRB- -- Reasonable battery life -LRB- 8 + hrs . just playing music -RRB- -- Very crips , clear display -- Excellent sound and flexible audio controls -- Shortcut button is customizeable Cons : -- Screen scratches and smudges easily -- Lack of accessories -- Proprietary charger\/USB interface -LRB- also meaning you ca n't charge in the car until they make such an accessory -RRB- I use my Vision : M daily in an industrial environment and have even dropped it twice , but it did not even stop playing . I purchased a `` Marware SportSuit Sleeve '' -LRB- says it will fit all iPods including new 3G iPods but easily fits the Vision : M -RRB- and it is a great case for those who will use thier player in a variety of conditions as it has padded sides and plastic inserts for impact protection , repels water , and has a removeable belt clip . The only downer to the SportSuit is the headphone jack location , but the flap closure is flexible and can easily be secured by going around that once your headphones are plugged in . All in all I am very pleased with my Vision : M and highly recommend it . 	Video Player

yes the control scheme may confuse you for a bit but after bout 5 to 10 minutes of foolin around wit it u pick it up quick . And thers so many features its unbelivable . organize the main menu the way u want it . pick and chose what you want showing . multiple color schemes load pics onto it and set em as wallpapers . you can even play the music -LRB- which sound crysal clear and good volume -RRB- and leave it playing while u browse around all the menus looking at pic play slide show to the music and go right back to the now playing screen . the movie quality is the best iv ever seen . Much brighter and more colorfull than the ipod video thing or the psp . even if the video is bad quality before u load it on the the zen in my opinion it seems like it makes it better . It slightly cumbersum to fast forward and rewind music or movies but u get used to it easily enough . and it holds so much !! iv got all my good music 40 pics and 2 hours of video and that only used 2 gigs of the starting total of 28.5 -LRB- the reason its not the said 30 is the complex operating system and the bunch of songs , pics and vids they load it with -RRB- The one bad thing i have to state is that the manufacture no longer includes an a.c. charger so out of the box the only way to charge it til u get one is plugin to ur pc but thats no to bad . If ur looking to upgrade from somthing smaller or just wanting to go big this is the thing to shoot for . 	Video Player
This is a fabulous MP3 player . One disappointment : It does NOT record FM , which was the main reason I bought and the product info from Amazon stated it had this feature . Other than that , it is terrific and easy interface\/use . I really do n't care that it charges via USB since my computer is generally on anyway . 	Video Player
I love creative ... this is a good product but I liked the first zen xfi alot better . Especially listening to audio books , I cant forward or rewind and when listening to music I have to scroll down through everything instead of going through alphabet . But again it sounds great and I likr how small and light it is . 	Video Player
Maybe I have a lemon , but I find the volume control on this unit to be absolutely aatrocious . Sound ... fine , video ... fine , actually , everything is fine EXCEPT the volume control . I have had the unit about 8 months now and had I known how difficult it is to control the volume , I would NEVER have bought this unit . It seems remarkably stupid to make what is primarily an audio device and put such poor volume controls on it . But maybe you wo n't find it as irritating as I do . 	Video Player
I received an 80 Gig ipod as a gift -LRB- nice gift huh -RRB- . Anyway I loaded it will all of my music about 10,000 songs and was happily listening to my music . Then one day I was browsing the itunes store . They have videos and tv shows . Cool , browsing around some more and noticed that they have my sons favorite cartoon , since we were going back east for Christmas I thought it would be cool to load the ipod with cartoons so I did n't need to lug the DVD player along . Now my son loves it so much that when he 's at grandma he needs his ipod . That 's right it 's his 80 gig ipod now . So I 'm in the market for another one for mommy 's music ! 	Video Player
Im 12 years old , and I got my Zen just last Christmas . I absolutely LOVE it ! I use it just about every day . With a 30GB hardrive , you NEVER run out of room to store stuff . The screen looks like a Hi-Def TV , and the photo viewer is nice and user-friendly . Plus it has tons of extras -LRB- fun to mess around with -RRB- like the voice recorder , FM radio , organizer , and tons more !! Videos that you can purchase in the Amazon Video Unbox thing go very nicely with the player . I have a lot of videos from there . But there are a few small problems . The screen is kinda scratch-prone so BUY A SCREEN PROTECTOR !! Or like a case that covers the screen . Those work good too . The battery dosent keep a charge very long , but if you put in the lock position when listening to music and turn the screen brightness to 50 or 60 % , that helps with battery life a lot . Touchpad can be too sensitive occasionally but with some use you can get used to it . I highly reccomend this product . ITS AWESOME !! 	Video Player
The ubiquitous ipod needs no introduction , pretty much everyone is familiar with it . And while the ipod offers a sleek design , simplistic interface , ease of integration with itunes and loads of accessories , the ipod is neither the best nor your only option as it lacks many features of its competitors including fm radio , recording capabilities , customization , and it ties you in to the itunes ecosystem . So while the ipod is a good device for what it is , I suggest you be open minded and do your research to find the player that fits your needs and provides the features you need , instead of just going with the `` gotta have an ipod to look cool '' mentality . And if you 're looking for a simplistic mp3 player with video capabilities that has a wide variety of accessories and ease of integration with itunes then by all means the ipod is perfect for you . And if you value aestetics over features , buy the ipod . But if you 're looking for a more feature rich player with more capabilities I suggest you look at some better options -LRB- the Creative Zen Vision : M , iRiver Clix , and Cowon D2 come easily to mind -RRB- . And I also recommend that if you are looking for a player to work out with than do n't get a hard drive based player like the video ipod as you 'll just end up shortening its lifespan , instead look for flash based players like the ipod nano or other brands , which again offer more features for the money , like iriver or samsung .

I really love this DVD player . It is the best Sony product ever . For a DVD player that is under $ 200 , it sure has pretty PERFECT PICTURE . The sound is WONDERFUL !!! The only little , and I mean little , problem is the block noise . Even if the BNR is on , it may show up a little on the DVD . But , this is NOT the players fault . It called an MPEG-2 artifact left behind . Other then that , THIS DVD PLAYER IS PRACTICALLY THE BEST EVER . Everyone who has something negative to say about it has a seriously defective unit , or is exaggerating . Plus , BIG NEWS !!!! This models book and box states that this DVD player can not play CD-R or CD-RW discs . Well , this is not true . It plays of coarse all Sony CD-R and CD-RW discs PERFECTLY . It also plays Fuji discs as well . I definitely recommend Sony CD-RW . It plays just soooooooooooo good . 	Video Player
After several attempts to own a functional MP3 player from Creative , I gave up . It should not be this hard ; iPod , here I come . My first Creative Player broke within three months of opening the box . I returned it -LRB- a small but manageable hassle -RRB- . I received an entirely new one about two weeks later , no charge . Two months later , had power management issues with the new one ; Creative recommeded an upgrade to the firmware . OK , fine . Three months later , the thing completely crashes -- no music , no connectivity to my PC , nothing but a permanent splash screen . I tried the restore mode , but none of the restore functions were working . The thing was dead dead dead . I called Creative to see what they could do . For $ 25 , they could tell me what I already knew : it was n't working and needed to be fixed . Then , they made it clear that they would be charging me for whatever it took to fix it . All this despite the fact that THEY sent me this lemon and it was less than a year -LRB- read : still within warranty -RRB- since I had received it . Great customer service , eh ? Bad product + bad customer service = doomed company . Do n't buy a Creative Product . 	Video Player
I 've had the unit for about 2 weeks now and have done everything you can do with it . It 's performed flawlessly and quite impressively . I find it becomes quite easy to use if you spend just a little time with the comprehensive manual . It 's very cool . No complaints so far , and there is a good discussion group about the Archos players on Yahoo . 	Video Player
The earbuds have been a problem for me ... do n't fit well and wo n't stay in my ears ... and the whole scratching issue is not one to be taken lightly ... I 've swapped out the apple earbuds for a pair of cheapo sony 's that I had lying around and they sound quite a bit better than the originals ... planning someday to invest in a pair of noise canceling phones . I also strongly suggest people ordering this player get a case even before they get the ipod ... I have treated mine with extreme care from the moment it came out of the box but have found some minor scratching and fingerprinting that is very hard to remove . I really think apple needs to address this issue . I 've never seen anything so hard to keep looking good ... and this 30 gig ipod is beautiful to look at ... very classy , , minimalist look and you ca n't help but want to keep it looking good . . Overall , it is , though , an amazing product which does what it supposed to ... I 'm glad I bought it and would also recommend the Klipsch IGroove docking station to go with it ... , 	Video Player
Day 1 : freezes up for the whole day and night . turning off or resetting was not working either . Day 2 : find out that the speaker can not be turned off . in the setting menu you can turn it off but it only lasts as long as it is turned on . if you switch it on again the next day the speaker is on again . every time you want to play sthg . the thing comes on . very annoying . Day 3 : find out folders can not be created like in iTunes i.e. no option to creat folder and sub-folder . followed online directions for folder creation . did n't work either . either directions posted on creative website were wrong or my player was a bad player . Day 4 : returned the thing . 	Video Player
Bought a 30G for my daughter 's birthday . It lasted about 3 weeks before giving up the ghost . One day we just could n't get any response at all from the unit . We went through all the reset procedures on the Ipod -LRB- excuse me , iPod -RRB- support site to no avail . Amazon came through and paid the return shipping on the dead unit and sent us a new one before receiving the old one . The new unit got here 3-4 days later and probably lasted a whole 30 minutes dying exactly the same way as the first one . These units were n't dropped or mishandled in any way ; so I believe the failures are probably due poor design or quality control on Apple 's part . I 've had an Iriver 20G for a couple of years now . I 've traveled extensively with it and no problems . So it is apparently possible to produce robust HD based units . Anyway , I feel badly for my daughter because I think she really enjoyed it while it worked but this product appears to be a triumph of marketing over quality . . 	Video Player
I did a lot of debating between the iPod and the Creative Vision : M before deciding on the Creative . With the prices now equal , I think there 's really no reason not to go with the Creative . The player is gorgeous , feels solid , does n't have the stupid scratchable chrome to worry about , it has a very intuitive and simple to use interface , the sound quality is amazing , and what comes in the box is way better than the iPod -LRB- better headphones , a wall charger , good documentation -RRB- . I think the only thing you give up is the ability to sync with iTunes . If you do n't care about this , then it 's a no-brainer , go with the Creative . I 'm very happy with my player , an alternative for those who do n't want to say baaaa when Steve Jobs touts the next big thing . 	Video Player
Bought this for my son for Christmas after much research . Opened it , downloaded music . Got up next morning , it froze up , said battery very low and then got the sad face `` contact support .

From the looks of things , I do n't believe I 'm alone . 	Video Player

This is the 3rd Zen I 've had . I had to replace my Vision M because I dropped it one too many times , & wanted 32 gigs because of all the music I had from Napster & Rhapsody . Unfortunately , after I bought the Style , I come to find out it wo n't work with either of those programs , despite the website linking to Napster . To say I 'm disappointed is an understatement .

I like the product and the shipping was do in a few days . very good . 	Video Player
I have so much storage I do n't even know what to do with it all right now , but it will be useful in the future , I think . So I think the product may stand the test of time . Even though it 's user friendly , there are lots of options I 'm not sure how to use . A manual with pictures or even a VIDEO DEMO -- seeing as that is one of the features -- would have been perfect . In addition , it seems that you need to purchase accessories like FM transmitters to use it to play in your car or home stereo -- it does not come with these items . They also do n't tell you that it needs to be CHARGED ! So you need a charger either via your car or remember to plug it in to your computer before it 's too late . 	Video Player
Thought long & hard about Zen vs. Ipod . After 3 months , still LOVE the Zen & am happy with my choice . I 'm an avid E-book listener -LRB- via Online County Library & pay sites -RRB- and this drove my choice as Library does not use Ipod 's proprietary access . This product has exceeded my average user with podcast , audiobook , music , pictures -LRB- and even movie -RRB- needs ! 	Video Player

Well to say the truth i expected more of this product , but it 's working great . Battery is lasting for a very long time , the quality of the sound is great and you can adjust the EQ for yourself . On the background u can a put your favorite photo of your girlfriend , boyfriend , family , etc. . The sound recorder is GREAT . it 's even more the just GREAT . The sound is clean . It 's possible to record songs from built-in FM-Tuner , which is kinda rare in the MP3 players . The thing i do n't like is that if u push the butten , the screen lights up after a while . Video quality is pretty good , but in order to convert it into the needed format and size you have to download the program called IRIVETER . That 's all i can say 	Video Player
First off remember the old DVDs , they would only hold around 4 gigs of media or 9 if dual\/double layer disc ... . those are n't HiDef ... A Blu-Ray disc on the other hand holds around 25 gigs single ... 50 for double ... So for a Little 4 gig player to be anywhere as good as Blu-Ray it would need more this and that ... Most Hi-Def movies are only 720 and the only time 1080 makes a big difference in picture is if you have to sit right in front of a 60 inch or bigger TV for it to be worth 1080 . Our old tube computer monitors were always much higher then 1080 because the smaller a text has to be the more Resolution is needed . DVRs record Hi-def of onw movie and uses about 4 or so gigs but there is alot involved in getter that done thru the Plasma\/LCD and DVR\/Receiver Box ... 	Video Player

I am overall very impressed with the Zen vision M. I like the user interface and overall performance . I love the built in radio and voice recorder . I would choose the Zen Vision M over the Ipod any day . But I will be fair with this review . Here are the problems I have run into . The screen scratches easily and the leather cases are not yet sold in the USA . I just used a stick-on screen protector for a palm pilot -LRB- Clear packing tape will also work . -RRB- I had to cut the tape to fit but it has worked great . If you push too many buttons too fast when it is thinking -LRB- Like loading a movie or fast forwarding etc. -RRB- It sometimes freezes up . Not a problem though . Just use a paperclip click the reset button at the bottom . Only tech geeks will find this next one as a problem . Computer system requirements say windows XP SP1 . But there are no drivers for SP1 . I had to upgrade to SP2 . For any NON-tech person reading this do n't worry , windows automatic updates probably fixed that for you months ago . 	Video Player
There are some great things about this mp3 player . The price , the built in speaker , the small size , clear screen , easy to press buttons , the built in recorder , several options for playback , stable built-in software ... it has n't locked up on me yet . There are some quirks about this mp3 player . Every time you plug it in to charge it , if your headphones are n't in it , it starts blaring from the speaker and you have to turn it off . If you press the power button for less than three seconds , it `` locks '' the player , and you have to press it two more times . If you use the DJ feature and make it think about the 20 most popular songs , it ends up freezing the screen for a minute or so while it `` thinks '' but then it snaps out of it and you can use it . Dont load in the software that comes with it . I use Media Monkey , and that works like a charm ... fast , automatic , easily organizable . But it also means that all the `` extras '' on the mp3 player are unusable . I ca n't use the videos , RSS feed , podcast feature ; i ca n't delete or change songs or playlists from within the player because it just goes back to how it was when I re-sync it ... The screen scratches EASILY . You must get a screen protector . The battery life has been averaging about 15 hours for me , and I have the brightness set to medium and mostly just let it play on random and leave it alone . All in all it 's not as good of a player as it 's advertisted to be , but all in all , I 'm used to the quirks now and I DO still recommend it . I think the Ipod has some pretty nice features like Genius and intuitive menus ... but keep in mind that an Ipod puts you out a hundred dollrs more and has reliability issues . So considering what you get for the price with this little guy , I ca n't complain too much . 	Video Player
The device is great as a music player , sound output can get real loud with the given ear phones . Screen is vivid , bright and video quality is good , however plastic tends to scratch easily . Player hangs if MP3 song is corrupt and only way to get around is to reset it let battery run down . Player starts automatically when connected to USB port , did not charge from my dell D610 Laptop though . Can use any DC convertor rated at 2Amps - 5 V and having the yellow ended connector -LRB- sony ?! -RRB- with inside positive . Mic recording quality is great and can be used as a dictaphone . Connects to TV using Zen video cable or odinary audio video cable with jack modified as follows : Identify and mark the three wires near the jack end as WHITE , YELLOW and RED . Then cut the cable close to the Jack end . rejoin as follows -LRB- each wire has an uninsulated wire called ground and a thin insulated wire called Hot -RRB- .

It 's been 2 years since I bought an MP3 player from Creative 's ` Zen ' line , and with the huge advancements made over the span of this time , I decided that it was time for a new upgrade . Naturally , after doing a bit of research , upgrading to the next series in line seemed the way to go -LRB- and so I did -RRB- . The Creative Vision : M , upon inspection when I recieved it , was a quantom leap ahead of its predecessor . Its smaller , sleeker , more beatiful and functional . The Vibrant 2.5 ' LCD dominate iPOD video 's with its slightly-larger size and more vibrant\/numerous color pallete . As of this time , I didnt have any vidoes I wanted to transfer , but I was amazed at the `` commercials '' that Creative packed in with this MP3 player -LRB- just why Creative would decide to put in commercials advertising a product you 've arleady bought is a complete mystery altogether -RRB- . Setting this player up and Sync ` ing it with Windows Media player was a snap . For those ` not-in-the-know ' , sync ` ing your player to your computer basically means that your ` My Music ' ` My Pictures ' folders on your PC will be duplicated and put in your Zen Vision , and any future changes you make in your PC will be reflected in the Zen Vision whenever you sync up to it . Of course , my only gripe about the sync ` ing process is the time it takes do to it . I would be more appreciative if Creative gave us a Firewire outlet because it would have made the transfer of data much quicker . Now that I 've got all the good stuff out of the way , you 're probably wondering why I gave this MP3 3 stars instead of 5 . Well ... its not so simple , but if you want to wittle down my biggest complaint about the Zen Vision : M its the user Interface . It sucks . Horrendously . Creative tried to take what 's good about the iPOD interface -LRB- the ` clicky ' wheel -RRB- and simplify it even further . The result is instead of having to twirl your fingers around the wheel , you simply move it in an up-down fashion , and when you want to make a selection slide your thumb to the left-or-right in the middle of the touch-sensitive area . Right idea ... wrong execution . The Amazon review pointed out that this results in your accidently ` playing ' songs when you want to simply navigate through menus , or vise-versa . It happens far more often then they mention . There 's also a problem with the fireware where navigating ` down ' didnt feel as smooth as navigating ` up ' . All these issues combine to make a world of headache for those trying to navigate through hundreds of songs that they 've uploaded into their player . I dont understand why Creative didnt just use a mouse-wheel scroller instead , because it would have been far less combersome -LRB- even though some would have considered it less ` elegent ' -RRB- . Screw that , give me functionability over ` elegeance ' anyday of the week . So really , if you can get over the aweful navigational touch-pad , then I whole-heartedly recommend this over an iPOD . Its music quality , LCD are much better . If you absolutely think you can not -LRB- and you dont care that much about the stuff I mentioned above -RRB- , and you can afford to wait a little longer , then buy the 80 gigabyte iPOD instead . Yes , we all hate Steve Job 's as much as the next guy , and as much as we 'd like to see iPODs stanglehold of the market released , we can all admit that in part its because they actually test their products out on people for more then a week before its released .

Hey ! I finally caved in and searched for a nice mp3 player . I really like the idea of placing most of your collection on one device and take it anywhere with complete access to it . I originally just wanted it for music but then Ipod and Creative Zen came out with their video playback capability . I enjoy movie trailers , short clips , and pic online so the video capabiltiy is appealing for myslef . So I had to debate to buy one or the other . If you just want music then video is not required . I got the creative zen for the following reasons and compared it to the 30g Ipod video and mp3 player : 1 . Display screen seemed brighter to me . I really like color and this applealed to me . Also a little larger . The Ipod picture was darker and faded looking . 2 . Supposedly could playback multiple video files like mp3 , wma , dvix -LRB- sp ? -RRB- , xvid -LRB- sp ? -RRB- ect . 3 . I liked the layout menu for songs and video . And I liked how in the background I could select one of my pics for the background even adjust the coloring on it just like how you do on your computer monitor for wallpaper . I do n't know if Ipod allows this , I tried to and do n't remember being able to do it . 4 . I liked how I could save space by instead of using mp3 files use wma files when ripping discs . Less quality but I did n't notice a difference . It says can take 15,000 wma songs based on I think about 2min songs or 7500 as mp3s . That 's not including video content though I believe . I currently have about 4,000 tracks and about 30-40 short video clips on it and maybe just about 200 cds ripped into it with 14gb left in the player . I still have another 100 cds to rip into it . 5 . Has FM radio that I can record songs to play back and even put it on my computer . 6 . Has a microphone . I can record clips off my tv of music I like from soundtracks I ca n't get or sounds on tv I want to play back to listen to again and again . Sound from microphone probably b\/c it is small and compact is not spectacular but pretty good for a small little gadget . I can also record my self talking or playing my flute to play back or add onto the computer since the microphone is portable and I can position myself for the best acoustics necesary . LOVE this for my flute playing . DOWNSIDES to creative zen compared to Ipod : 1 . IPOD HAS EVERYTHING !!!!!!!! From accesories to the gosh darn movie trailers I 'm striving for . Very annoying . I 'm annoyed at apple b\/c it looks as if along with PSP has gone to certain movie websites to promote the product by providing mv4 format trailer clips FREE . It is not compatable with this player . Also many movie trailers I find are in apple or seems apple at least its viewable on apple itunes is the file . mov which is not compatable . So while the player can play multiple formats , it 's not the most used formats . Which is annoying . Also even the formats it supposedly can sometimes its a larger file or seems higher resolution -LRB- I 'm not computer person but had to be converted to view it -RRB- and sometimes not work . HOWEVER : There are various programs and some FREE ones that can help you convert the . mov and sometimes the dreaded ipod . mv4\/mp4 file or any file for that matter to windows media player file wma which is compatable for the player . Sometimes the quality is n't perfect . I 'll repeat the download and comes out ok usually . Sometimes does n't work right away -LRB- as you are using the programs to convert it -RRB- but try again and does . It 's just who wants to continue that all the time just to view it . However I have dealt with it for the other features . You can find many generic mp3 player accesories however finding cases are a problem . I went to Kmart , walmart , target and all had mostly Ipod cases . Target ONLY had Ipod cases . THIS is the reason I did n't want Ipod it just bugs me . But then I suffer not getting cool accesories . However all the reasons I mentioned above for liking the creative zen outweighs how `` cool it looks . '' I was able to find a nice leather case for this specific player on amazon . 2 . There seems to be more of a delay once the player starts becoming full with media . For ex not so much selecting album files , or artist files maybe it breaks it better but if I select all tracks takes a good 30-60 sec to accumulate it all so if you do that select a song do n't like it and go back can get time consuming to the point I try not to do that . It 's doable just when I looked at ipod seemed you wip through everythign VERY fast . However I do n't know how much media was on that Ipod I looked at . 3 . Ipod is skinnier . However it 's still the size of a deck of cards and heavier but tolerable for the first highlights I liked . 4 . The controls where cumbersome at first . Has a little touch pad to move up and down that was EXTREMELY annoying at first -LRB- just like the laptops with no mouse just that little touch pad -RRB- . But I did learn how to use it correctly . I 'd press lightly and to go up or down 1 or 2 songs go slowly but leave my thumb in place till I slected the song . I used to tap it down then realease the thumb causeing it to skip the song and go up and down up and down so you just have to find out how to press it and it 's actually not bad . However , due to it 's thickness and the positions of 4 buttons in a square pattern with the touch pad inbetween plus add a little case it can be cumbersome to manipulate it with one hand as you can with ipod . It 's totally doable but can get cumbersome . I 'm a klutz and almost dropped it b\/c it was cumbersome so I usually need one hand to control it and one to support it or my hand cramps . However while it 's cool to do it in one hand still the radio , display , microphone outweigh it . 5 . I would have rather purchased creative zen with 60gb as Ipod has available however not available for this product . I also hear Ipod will had microphone and radio at some point . 6 . It looks like you have to have windows to use this . I could be wrong . However I have windows so I use it without a problem . Some with ipod supposdely all you have to do is plug it into your computer and just piles your songs together for you without specific program . This you do need a media player supposedly . It comes with a program to rip discs and organizer to plug into your computer to add files hence probably why you need windows compatability . I did like the organizer how I can connect it to my computer and add playlists that way or rename songs . On the player itself too time consumming to search through all the songs and delay time to create a playlist there . However only organized by artists and I like it organized by album . Also can not seem to rename the main heading a file is under . I can rename the file but not the album once it 's in the player and working with the program organizer . 7 . This goes for all mp3 players , the FM radio transmitter to play in cars stink . Does not have a good sound . The only thing does work is one of those cd\/mp3player tape converter things that you plug into a tape player press play and play the player . On reg stereo system I hear a clicking from the cassette player and my car is a ford escape which has NO tape player or I 'd use it . SO : I ultimatly chose creative zen m vision for it 's display , microphone , radio , video capablity since I can convert almost any file for the most part to play in it usually -LRB- I do n't know how well Ipod can -RRB- . I did n't notice a differece in sound with this and Ipod . It 's small enough to keep in my purse . I love fooling with the display options and pics . I love adding internet video media to the player and the colors it transmits . I wish it was more user friendly as Ipod is such as going to a major motion pic webiste downloading the trailer bam get it in your player and watch it , more accesory options , easily transfer files to the player however creative zen can do all these functions and is more fun to fool around with for my tastes such as recording my flute anywhere without being stuck to my computer area which has no great acoustics . I do wish it was a little faster however I do get impatient ! OVERALL I enjoy this player a lot . I have to work at it but there seems to be more to fool around with here . HELPFUL HINTS : One time this player did freeze on me . Had it a couple months and never did before but I think it was with the delay with the all track feature . I displayed all the tracks , played a song then pressed back repeatedley -LRB- I 'm clicker trigger happy -RRB- and it froze . I read somewhere saying you have to replace the battery and maybe so on other models but NO you do n't have to infact I do n't think you can remove the battery which stinks b\/c supposedly Ipod has a thing that they will replace the battery when it depletes in hopefuly years to come but creative zen does n't . Anyway there 's a little hole with a reset button on the bottom player to the L. Take a small paper clip and press it and it will reset from the time it froze and you wo n't loose any data prior to that . Now if it froze as you added media it may not save the media you were transfering as it was interrupted . Takes about 5min but it reboots and there are your files ... whew I was petrifried when it froze and even if I got it to unfreeze I FREAKED I would loose my hours and hours of ripping time !!! But was saved . 	Video Player

I recently purchased this device , and I was very impressed . It has a number of this that make it better than an ipod , longer battery life , better colors for watching video , extra features such as fm tuner , or microphone . It was also very easy to load and unload music and videos . However just today after having this product for 2 weeks , it froze , and now refuses to work . Although I respect Creative 's product and will most likely try to replace my vision : m I would hope that in the future problems like mine would not occur . I hope that my problem is simply an anomally and not something that is likely to any one else 's Creative Zen Vision : M. 	Video Player
I bought this video player before a road trip for my 3 year old son to use in the car . Overall , I have to say that it works great . I used the Open Source software Handbrake to convert some of his children 's DVDs to video files -LRB- MKV with h. 264 video codec -RRB- . I then copied the files to the player using the included USB cable which was a little slow due to the nature of the maximum speed of a USB 2.0 connection , something you do n't think about until you are actually copying nearly 8GB of files . Once the files were copied over , the video playback on the device was excellent . I was a little concerned that I would n't be able to fit many of his shows onto the internal 8GB memory , but I was able to convert more or less full DVDs into ~ 850MB files , but most of the DVDs which are not full converted into files about half that size . I was able to fit lots of these into the internal memory . I bought an extra long USB cable at a local electronics store to be able to charge the player in the car while he 's watching it , but the battery has been so long lasting that we have n't actually had to use that . Notes\/concerns : \* The manual states that the maximum size microSD card supported by the player is 16GB . This limitation should be mentioned in Amazon 's product description . \* The buttons on the device itself are a little awkward to use for navigating the menu structure of the user interface . \* Some of the menus in the user interface -LRB- particularly where you configure device settings -RRB- show icons , but no text . This makes configuring the device more difficult than necessary . Aside from these issues , the device works great , and I did n't feel that these issues were big enough to warrant reducing the rating from 5 stars to 4 stars . 	Video Player
I 've owned my black Creative Zen player for about a month now . It took a while to get use to - but so did my other mp3 players . The battery life is decent , I could work a full shift -LRB- 10.5 hrs -RRB- without fear of the battery dying . . and part of the next day if I forgot to charge it . I have about 2,000 songs on it right now and havent had any problems with it . Windows Media Player is so much easier to use then my last nightmare of Sonic Stage . The sound is amazing on it , and the volume goes fairly loud . The display is the most amazing thing about it , the colors are so bright . . but it also kills your battery . I almost always have my player set at the lowest dimness possible except when I want to show it off . I enjoy having a radio and being able to record directly from it and the reception works just fine for me . Onto the dislikes . . the black scratches like no other . I was extremely careful with it and it scratched so easily . I did find a silicone type of case for it on amazon , but the damage had already been done . I did however drop the player from about 4 to 5 feet onto the cement recently and this thing is durable -LRB- pushed off a counter - wouldnt recommend it ! -RRB- . Ive never owned a harddrive based player before , but you can tell the difference . Theres a slight delay while switching between songs and a longer delay when choosing to randomnly play all songs . These things really did n't bother me when weighed against the pros of this player . Would recommend to anyone and everyone ! 	Video Player
I got this 2 days before schudled arrival and have had no problems with the item . EXACTLY WHAT I PAID FOR ! 	Video Player
I spent a long time researching mp3 players , trying to decide which one I wanted . I knew I did n't want an iPod , and I knew the basics that I wanted . At first I did n't want one like the Vision : M - I just wanted your basic player that did n't have Videos or whatever added . The more I looked around , the more I kept coming back to this mp3 though - and now that I 've bought it I 'm very happy I did . The sound quality -LRB- granted I 'm using different headphones than came with it -RRB- is wonderful , the screen is beautiful , and the interface is not only easy to use and easy to learn , but simple and quite easily done with one hand while doing other things that keep you from actually looking at it . Sure , it 's a little bulky , but it still fits just fine in a jeans pocket , or purse . It 's also very light . All in all , it 's a great product , and well worth the money spent on it .

So far I have n't had much trouble with my ipod . It works the way it should and even survived a drop from my purse onto a parking lot -LRB- and spent the whole day there -RRB- . I have n't been able to fill it up with songs yet but I am trying . The video quality is excellent and the sound quality as well . The only trouble that I have is getting videos onto the ipod . I can only get a few to transfer . It has n't very much changed my opinion of this product . A very good investment and I love it at the gym . I would buy it again . 	Video Player
While the Vision : M and the iPod Video -LRB- 5G -RRB- both have their strengths , neither is the perfect mp3 player . A quick rundown : The Vision : M has a better interface , better file handling , and a more vibrant screen . The iPod is slightly slimmer , and perhaps more stylish , and has more accessories and a wider viewing angle from the top . The screen on the Vision : M is better looking . Put the iPod and the Vision : M side-by-side with an identical image and it is instanlty clear that the Vision : M is brighter and more vibrant . The minor downside is that if you angle the screen down or up a little too far , the colors either white-out or invert . This means that you have to tilt the player just right for optimal viewing . The iPod colors are n't as rich , but the wider viewing angle does n't require any particular tilt to see the screen . Your hand will get tired from constant positioning if you watch a movie on the Vision : M , but your eyes will be a lot happier with the images they are seeing . As far as storage space is concerned , both units are exactly the same . Battery life is similar between the two and you wo n't notice a difference . Along with storage space and battery life , something else to consider is the user interface . Apple 's player controls are easy to use and very responsive . The Vision M : has a touchpad , which is also very responsive and easy to use . The 4 buttons surrounding it require some force to depress . Hopefully the buttons loosen up a bit with use ; otherwise , you 'll gripe every time you strain to press them . Despite the good hardware controls , the software interface of the iPod is lacking . The breadth and depth of the functionality and options available in the Vision : M are better . Things like themes , folders , navigation options , shuffle options , etc. that are not available in the Ipod stand out on the Vision : M. As an example , there is no bookmark function for iPod audio unless a file is a specially created `` audio book '' . If you have a few long audio files -LRB- e.g. recorded lectures , etc. -RRB- that you want to pause in the middle and then return to later , you 're out of luck . The Vision : M does have a bookmark feature so you can do just that . On the downside , neither of them will let you bookmark a movie . Nor will either of them let you bookmark a song within the context of a playlist , a nice feature if you listen to a long playlist , stop in the middle to do something else , and then want to return later to the same song within the playlist . Apple 's iTunes software is awful because if you plug someone else 's iPod into your computer you are likely to wipe out all the songs on their iPod . Once your files go onto the iPod , its almost impossible to get them back out -LRB- it is possible to get around this with third party software , but it is a far from perfect solution -RRB- . The Vision : M , on the other hand , not only lets you easily transfer files back and forth , but also lets you organize them any way you want in folders on the player . Since many people have built up a music collection over the years in their own unique folder structures , being able to keep them intact on the player is important . The iPod is too restrictive since it requires very specific audio and video formats to work with the player . With the Vision : M , there is no need to spend time jumping through file format hoops . Finally , the bundled USB adapter of the Vision M : requires a cable and a second adapter to connect . This means you will tote two things around with you to connect to a computer when all you really need is one . The iPod has only one cable . On the other hand , the bundled adapter on the Vision : M allows you to plug into a wall socket to charge . The iPod requires a completely different adapter to plug into the wall . It does n't even come with the player ; you have to pay extra . In the end , there is no clear winner . If you like style , small size , and choice of accessories , perhaps you 'll be happier with the iPod . If you like control over your files and rich screen color -LRB- with a little positioning -RRB- , perhaps the Vision : M is better . 	Video Player
Xmas present for daughter , really appreciated , excel shipping and well packed , tks a mil 	Video Player
I 've have my Creative Zen for two weeks now and I love it . I bought it as a present for myself . The one thing I liked over all about it from the beginning was the fact that I did n't have to pay extra to put music on my Mp3 player , like you have to do with an iPod . This is pretty much plug and play and excepts all music files . So far , I have a little over 1000 songs on there . With features that alowe all music shuffle , or you can select songs by playlists , genera , artist , or album -LRB- much like any standard player -RRB- . You can store Photos on it , but I have only put one photo on to test it . It lets you take a photo and set it as your wallpaper , but you need to pick a dark photo since you ca n't change the text color from White . It does show the photos nice and you can zoom in , since 2.5 inch screen is small already . Video is okay , but I would n't really use it unless I had nothing else to use . 2.5 inch makes everything hard to see but it 's big enough to atleast enjoy it if you do use it . I had some trouble trying to get it to play a couple of files , but just re-uploading them fixed it . The FM tuner is cool and I would use that . If you want to listen to a sports game or something like that , it 's very handy . Presets up to 30 stations and you can delete others and set new ones . But , if you have your music , ca n't say how much you will use it then . It 's a nice feature , but might never get used . The battery life is decent . I wish is was longer , but if you just hit play and lock it , it makes the batter last longer . It takes 2 hours to charge , and if you use the ac adaptor , you can chaged it a play it at the same time . Unlocked Play = 5-7 hours Locked Play = 10 + Hours Video = max of 3 hours if your lucky . Photos = Ca n't see anyone spending 9 hours looking at photos but it 's good for that too . I did n't use the head phones it came with . They did n't fit my ears and I like my sound blocking one better . If you like the in the ear kind , it comes with them . It comes with all the cords and software you 'll need , except for the video cords , but it has an ac cord for charging in the wall . The nice carrying case doubles as a screen cleaner , but I left the screen protecter it came with on . I do n't wanna damage the screen so be carefull . It will scratch easly . Over all , the price of 30 $ then the iPod auctally pays off in the end . You have good battery life and decent video playing ability . The FM tuner is good and so is viewing photos . It comes with the power cords and a nice carrying case . Note \* I rather enjoy mine and I 've never liked the iPod to begin with . Do some of your own research and read many reviews before you spend $ 300 + on something like this . 	Video Player
Simply put , this device is amazing . Before buying , I read dozens of reviews from users and tech sites and tested out friends ipod videos . And still , when I got my hands on the Zen Visoin M , I was amazed at the picture quality , radio performance , ease of use , sound quality , album art display ... good grief ... it is just an amazing product . Yes , there are minor annoyances -LRB- such as black version collects fingerprints like crazy -RRB- , but overall it is well worth your money . 95 % of you will be super satisfied with this product . I sure am . 	Video Player
i bought this almost a year ago . when i first started i had a hard time putting stuff on it but i got the hang of it . the bad part of it is you have to use mp4s you have to use the software that comes whith it to change it to an mp4 . the sceen is very big . i like that it has two head phone jacks . hope i helped you buy this 	Video Player
I purchased my P-3000 2.8 years ago and had been generally happy with it until now . For portability , ease of use , etc it was fabulous . And I thought it was ` durable ' - having been taken on a wildlife photo shoot trip into the Serengeti , Tanzania , a photo shoot into Denali National Park in Alaska , a photo shoot into India , and other trips to the Grand Canyon , southern canals of France , etc. . Post each use I cleaned it and ensured its firmware was up-to-date , the battery was always fully charged , etc. . And I dedicated it to photo backup and photo slide shows - never using it for playing music or videos nor any of the other ` uses ' for which Epson touted it . Now I 'm not convinced of its technical quality , especially its durabity , at all . I used it during a trip to Istanbul , Rome , and Venice last month and it seemed to work fine . I successfully downloaded each day 's shoot of photos without any apparent problems - in total some 22Gs of RAW photos . During the air flight back to North America I reviewed the photos saved on the unit and performed some initial rating rankings - all without any apparent ` issues ' . However , upon return when I connected the unit to my computer and attempted to transfer the images to my computer hard drive I ran into problems . The viewer would not complete its cycle of boot start-up . After several e-mail exchanges with Epson 's technical staff , and following their unsuccessful suggestions , including to perform a ` hard reset ' via the reset button , they eventually concluded that either the unit 's software or the hard drive had failed . They asked me to take the unit into one of their local service centres . There I discovered that the hard drive had failed - some `` mechanical operation failure '' which the service technican could not clearly explain - `` first time I 've ever worked on a P-3000 unit '' he said , observing he himself had to talk to the Epson techncial staff several times in order to find the cause of the problem . The result ? Epson would : i. not replace the HD - `` its out of the one year warranty '' and I would have to pay for a new HD . And their replacment cost was over $ 250Cdn for the same size HD -LRB- a 40G -RRB- , plus pay their ` service fees ' , as well as wait on a 6-10 week delay due to `` the drive being out of stock and is on back order '' ; and ii . not recover the photos from the old HD . The explanation being `` they do not do recovery '' . They would recommend a service agency to attempt the recovery but adivsed that costs would likely be some $ 1000 - it `` has to be done inside a clean environmental lab '' . Needless to say I was not pleased with Epson . A one year waranty on a HD , especailly in a viewer is ` cheap ' and a mechanical failure on a drive 2.8 years old seems to indicate a quality issue which they certainly should have been interested in discovery why . And at least , given it was post warranty , they could have offered to share in the cost of the replacement . Second , there is the issue of their cost for the replacement drive . In this day and age some $ 250 for a 40G HD is outrageous . I can buy a larger HD for less than that . Third , is the total cost issue . With the HD replacment cost plus the service fees my out-of-pocket expense would have come to more than the price of buying a new unit on e-bay . You 'd think at least Epson would have offered me a discount on a totally new unit . Especially since I 'm a long time customer , including having jsut purchased an Epson 3880 printer . So - where do I end up ? Well I 'm now worried about their support for my 3880 pritner . And I 've certainly spread the word on Epson 's treatment around my photoclub -LRB- over 300 members -RRB- and to other friends . And I would advice anyone NOT to buy a Epson P-3000 . Other portable backup drives , like LaClie , etc , have a far better techncial quality and certainly treat their customers with more respect . 	Video Player
This product is defective ! It does n't work and there 's absolutely no guaranty process to take care of this . We bought this product in Dec 07 and after 1 month of using it very sporadically it froze ! There was nothing we could do to get it back on . Took it to the store and got it replaced just fine . New unit froze in less than a month later ! Store refuses to replace it and sent us to the manufacturer . Manufacturer does n't provide a process to replace this piece of garbage ! If you are in the market for something like this , pass on this garbage ! You will be sorry if you do n't . By the way , there 's no way to take the battery out and reset it . You are out of options on this garbage ! Please , please pass on this . Thanks for your patience . Good luck on your search ! 	Video Player
Creates files as advertised , but be forewarned that the files will be huge , so you better have terabytes of space available if you want to build up a library of files . Also , the format the data is recorded in is difficult to find proper GNU editors that work at the higher resolution -LRB- 1080i -RRB- that you can save at . Of course , you can save at lower resolutions by adjusting the output of your source device . Software provided does good job of converting to lower resolution formats for other playback devices , from various smart phones to game consoles . Keep in mind that converting formats can take 150-250 % of the time of the actual length of the recorded video to re-encode the data , depending on your system 's speed , memory , and # of processor cores .

Even after reading through all the bad reviews here , I still opted to buy this unit . After a week , we 've had no technical problems with it at all . <p> There was some trouble with the activation of the unit ; for some reason it did n't could n't figure out that the activation fee had been paid . I called Technical support , and got to talk to somebody immediately -LRB- no hold time -RRB- . I spent 20 minutes on the phone with Tech Support going back and forth trying to figure out what was going on . They updated something in their database , and shortly after , my grace period was extended -LRB- so I could keep using the unit -RRB- , and then few hours later , the issue was resolved . Although it did take some time -LRB- and the unit did n't record `` The Daily Show '' that morning -RRB- , I 'd still say that 's pretty good . <p> If you have cable-TV and a cablebox , I recommend that you do n't connect the unit to the cablebox , but rather get a splitter , and have one cable go to the cablebox and one to the RTV unit . That way , the RTV does n't have to change the channel on the cablebox , and you can record something while watching something else . You ca n't record premium content though ... <p> Works good with my broadband connection as well ; it gets all the networking info from my firewall , and goes out on the internet to download the program guide and updates . However , sending shows to other users on the internet might not be a feature that 'll be used a lot , and here 's why : This unit records up to 40 hours on a 40GB drive . That means that a 1 hour show is about 1GB . That is a huge file to transmit over the internet , even if you do have broadband . My connection is capped at 300kbsp outbound , meaning it would take over 9 hours to transmit this file ! And that 's at `` standard '' recording quality . File size increases fast if you record at a higher recording quality . <p> Recording at standard quality is ok for most shows , but it can get a bit pixelated in high-speed scenes . For sport events , you should definately record at a higher quality setting , or that tennis ball will be one big square blur flying across the screen . <p> Commercial skip works fairly well , but it 's not perfect . It misses some commercials , and sometimes it skips a little too far , so you may have to rewind a few seconds of the show to catch the beginning of the section . <p> Overall , a very good experience for us . The ability to search for shows , and easily record every episode without having to look for VCR + codes and swapping out worn-out video tapes certainly makes it more enjoyable to watch TV .

I just tried to post this review on Circuit City -LRB- that 's where I purchased it -RRB- . But it wo n't let me . Hmmm ... I 've been with Directv for about 2 years . My family and I had the Directv w \/ Tivo unit -LRB- R10 -RRB- during that time . It really is great having a DVR . So we decided to add another DVR in the kitchen and purchased this unit . We read the online reviews and thought it ca n't really be THAT BAD . So what if it is n't Tivo . Its a DVR and will do what we need it do . Yes , it is THAT BAD . I was shocked at how hard it is to work . Everyone is my family is a technology buff\/geek\/expert . But this unit is so cumbersome to get around , let alone set up a season pass . The menu functions are not user intuitive , its slow . I thought it was just this unit so we returned it for a second one . Nope , they all operate at a snails pace . This was a waste of time and money . Had I really listened to these other customer reviews we would have been spared much frustration . The moral of the story is - do n't waste your time and money on this HUNK OF JUNK . Just get a Tivo . Your family will thank you for it . 	Video Recorder
This toy was well worth the money spent - we take advantage of its features every single day . Some of the more useful situations include : <p> - Being able to pause tv when the phone rings , and then resume . <p> - Start watching sports an hour after they begin and breeze through commercials and intermissions . <p> - Easily set up programs to record shows we like that air during the day . <p> - A big help with housetraining our puppy as we can pause the tv and respond immediately when ever she noses around the door to go out . <p> Of course , any time you pause live tv or record a show , you get to skip commercials ! You 'll start looking for reasons to delaying watching a program . Setting up recording with the on-screen programming is simple . Plus , you can even set up recordings away from home via the web if you forget ! How cool is that ? The machine is intelligent enough to know show titles , so you can tell it to ignore re-runs . It 's simple to review all the recorded shows on screen , instead of knowing it 's somewhere on a VCR tape . All with no monthly fee ! <p> Summary : this is the coolest and most useful recreational item we own . You wo n't be disappointed ! 	Video Recorder
This recorder fits my needs perfectly and was exactly what I was looking for . I had this device hooked up in minutes , it works well . The picture , with a good over the air signal , is very good . I absolutely love it ! I would recommend this to anyone ! 	Video Recorder
BOUGHT THE PVR FOR MY SON WHO WANTS TO PLAY AND RECORD XBOX 360 GAMES AT SAME TIME . TO START OFF , I DID NOT KNOW THAT THIS DEVICE DID NOT HAVE A BUILT-IN HARD DRIVE , SO THE WORDS ` PVR ' DOES NOT MATCH ITS NAME . IT SHOULD BE CALLED AN ` HD ENCODER ' INSTEAD . ORDERED IT ON AMAZON , GOT IT 4 DAYS LATER , NOT BAD . OPENED IT UP , SURPRISE ! ITS NOT A PVR , BUT A FANCY HD VIDEO ENCODER WITH COMPONENT VIDEO INPUTS AND OUTPUTS IN THE BACK , PLUS STANDARD DEF INPUTS ON THE FRONT . ITS IS NOT A STANDALONE PRODUCT -LRB- ALTHOUGH I WISH IT WERE -RRB- , AND REQUIRES A COMPUTER FOR RECORDING , EDITING AND UPLOADING TO YOUTUBE . SO WENT TO MY GARAGE , SEARCHED FOR MY OLD -LRB- NO LONGER USED -RRB- 512K RAM , 250GB , CELERON 3.2 GHZ XP COMPUTER , BROUGHT IT BACK TO LIFE WITH AN OLD KEYBOARD , MOUSE AND MONITOR . REMOVED ALL UNUSED SOFTWARE TO MAKE ROOM FOR WHAT I THOUGHT WERE GOING TO BE VERY LARGE VIDEO FILES CREATED BY THIS ` PVR ' ENCODER -LRB- ABOUT 212GB OF SPACE LEFT . INSTALLED THE COMPUTER NEXT TO THE XBOX 360 IN MY SON 'S ROOM AND INSTALLED THE SOFTWARE THAT CAME WITH THE PVR . CONNECTED THE XBOX 360 COMPONENT VIDEO-AUDIO OUTPUTS TO THE PVR AND FROM PVR TO HD TV . SO WE DID A TEST RUN BY RECORDING A SHORT GAMEPLAY VIDEO AND TO MY SURPRISE , IT WORKS PRETTY GOOD . IT EVEN ALLOWS YOU TO SELECT ` MP4 ' REALTIME ENCODING FROM DVR TO COMPUTER FOR DIRECT UPLOADING TO YOUTUBE WITHOUT ANY CONVERTION ! SO WE MADE A 3-MINUTE TEST VIDEO AND IT ONLY TOOK UP ABOUT 73MB IN MP4 FORMAT -LRB- RESOLUTION WAS 720X480 , WITH VERY CLEAR SOUND -RRB- . UPLOADED TO YOUTUBE AND 5 MINUTES LATER WE WERE WATCHING THE RECORDED GAMEPLAY IN NEAR HD QUALITY . HIGHLY RECOMMENDED , BUT KIDS , LET AN ADULT SET IT UP FOR YOU . 	Video Recorder
Buy this thing as soon as you have enough money . I ca n't see owning a TV without this feature . <p> This item works as advertised but makes me feel gypped , knowing I didnt have this in my digital toolbox years ago ! <p> There are loads of cool features you 'll find that are n't in the sales dox ... and with very little new learning needed , unlike with most new electonic doodads I 've bought . Best of all , the remote control did n't tick me off . <p> I 've had no actual trouble with it , though I can think of a couple of things that would make it better -LRB- although possibly more expensive -RRB- : <p> 1 -RRB- I want to configure when the daily download occurs - it 's my phone line and I want it available when I say . on the positive side , the download gets interrupted if anyone calls me -LRB- circa 3am -RRB- , so it wont do you any harm . <p> 2 -RRB- multiple streams - would be nice to watch live\/delayed tv and have replay going on another stream all while recording another channel in the background . it may be that they are working on this , since it 's such a powerful and obvious idea . <p> 3 -RRB- the myReplayTV website is too dependent on fancy html or java or fancy graphics - i 'm for a simpler and FASTER layout . I find it faster to use the remote . <p> 4 -RRB- the written instructions are easy to follow and show a bunch of alternative configurations , but didnt get exotic enough for me ... and that info was not available on their site -LRB- i dont use a regular tv , but instead use the s-video in on my computer monitor ; also wanted the vcr to be input and output for the replayTV box , etc -RRB- <p> 5 -RRB- make the sound output for the ReplayTV box adjustable via the remote .

After going on vacation for a week and missing two of my favorite shows because the VCR tape got full and they changed the night of one of my programs , I took the bait , and boy , am I impressed ! I used to tape a lot of shows , but Tivo makes finding and watching much easier . 	Video Recorder
I had gotten this thing for christmas a month ago . Without a doubt this one of this best things i ever recieved . I set it up with my network and cable box in all of 15-20 min . The set-up was a breeze . It was no harder to set-up than a VCR . The remote is very comfortable to use and the button placement was very easy to learn . The quality of playback is superior to anything out there . The Replaytv gives about 15 hours at high quality , about 25 hours at medium quality and 40 hours at low quality . High quality is fantastic , Medium is good and low is acceptable . If you are watching from about 15 feet -LRB- like me -RRB- Medium as your best bet , as you can not notice the difference between medium and high . The interface is quite nice , though not very colorful with a few shades of blue . It has alot of useful features , such as the photo transfer software which worked flawlessly on my Windows XP system . The Internet file sharing as excrutingly slow , but handy if you missed a favorite show . One of the better features is Myreplaytv which lets people program there replaytv to record , anywhere in the world , however navigation is a little slow . Accessing the setup menu is slightly delayed , but this barely becomes annoying . Rrecording shows is extermely simple . Just select a show in the guide and set it to record with all your prefrences . You can also set it to record every episode . There are also things called `` replay zones '' , which lets you record all of the shows in a specific genre . The rewind and instant replay features work well . The best feature , however , is commercial skip which does that in recorded shows . It is about 80-85 percent successful . The only thing that i dislike is that i have to use the included IR Blaster , in which the box automatically changes the channels on my cable box . It is extremly slow , even after fine tuning , which did help . Overall an excellent product , and if you buy it and have to use the IR blaster , search the web to find out how to fine tune the IR blaster . 	Video Recorder
Ever since i got my Archos Jukebox 20 Multimedia , i was hoping that i could find some more reliable mp3 player with more extra space , and more features . When the AV380 was out , it was the thing i was looking for . The AV380 is an excellent tool that has the space anyone requires , its 80 G ! and it has a very nice display much more better than the Jukebox 's display . Big and clear display . It has the wonderful AV recorder which comes inside the pack , makes video recording very easy . you wont need a video anymore . connects easily to the TV or VCR , but u should be careful of the cables connecting the AV380 because they turn out to be too plenty . The remote control -LRB- wireless -RRB- is excellent and makes life easier when placing the AV380 away from you . I usually connect the AV380 to my surround system , and connect it to the TV so that i get to see the display on the big screen , and then i choose what i want to listen , or choose to play any video using the remote control . The negative thing which i didnt like was the camera . I paid 199 $ for the camera , but its not worth it . The still pictures are not good , and the video camera works very bad . and the zooming makes a loud sound which gets recorded in the background of the video you are recording . Just too bad . . You can pay 200 $ for a normal 3.3 mega pixels digital camera . generally speaking , the AV380 is excellent for movie recording and for MP3 playing . Way better than the IPOD or any other brand in the market . 	Video Recorder
There 's not much that I can add to these reviews that has n't already been said . This is a piece of garbage , flawed from the ground up - the design of the interface and the features that actually do work is just as awful as the bugs that plague the software . Overall this DVR struck me as a prototype or a product mock-up - I am astounded that this device would actually be sold to consumers . I 'm not sure what the impulse was behind the couple of favorable reviews here . I can only imagine that if this was someone 's first experience with a DVR , they might be more forgiving and assume that all the problems in this unit are inherent in DVRs in general . THEY ARE NOT ! This is a bad , poorly designed product . That 's not an opinion . It is difficult to use where other units are simple and it does n't work where other units do . You ca n't get less subjective than that . 	Video Recorder
Be aware that there are two white boxes in the market . One is older and there is no A\/V Adapter cable for your Svideo input . So please make sure that you have a A\/V adapter cable in the box or purchase other brands which work fine two . This is their reply : '' I 'm sorry that you feel that way but it states specifically that it does not include one . It is not a defect or missing part it was how the model was sold . Also we still do sell a oem which is what you purchased only the kit comes with the cable set . So it is not people after a certain point lose out it is based on the model you purchased .

I went a whole two weeks without Tivo . I 'll never do that again . My new Tivo arrived 2 days early and within minutes it was up and running . Is there any other way to watch TV ? 	Video Recorder
I thought I can get QAM also the Win TV scheduler is not working but otherwise , it is a good product and I am pretty happy with it . 	Video Recorder
We love our new TIVO !! It is as easy to use as our old one but with added ability to record 2 shows and watch another channel or recorded show at the same time . As usual , Amazon did a great job - received the TIVO well within the 7-10 days we were told it would take . 	Video Recorder
Evidently , TiVo got Humax -LRB- a Korean company -RRB- started in introducing their TiVo by manufacturing them first on the same assembly line . These are marked `` Made in Mexico . '' On a receint visit to Circuit City , I saw four boxed examples of this TiVo on the shelf . Two were marked `` Made in Mexico '' and two were marked , `` Made in China . '' All of the displays were marked `` Made in Mexico . '' The one that I received directly from TiVo is marked `` Made in Mexico . '' It appears to be of the same exact quality as the TiVo branded machine that I have owned for over one year . Except for the face plate , color of the case and a the color of the screen backgrounds and the inclusion of Humax on a few of the displays , it is nearly identical to the TiVo branded unit . I do n't know if the ones marked `` Made in China '' are of the same quality or if they will continue making them on the regular TiVo plant in Mexico . But , be aware that there are two versions with different UPC codes . 	Video Recorder
Item worked really well , just a heads up , The Win 7 drivers were NOT on the install disc that came with the 116 , did n't find that out until I was troubleshooting the no audio problem . They are available on EZcap 's website , installed those and it worked like a charm !! 	Video Recorder
Hold on a minute ! Where 's the DVD recording and playback ? Recording to hard disk is great , but some things are worth keeping by transferring to DVD . Not only that , but one often wants to play a DVD . Having to add to the pile of devices to do that is perfectly silly . The DVD player and recorder should be part of the system The crazy thing is that in America , unlike Europe where it 's common , it is almost impossible to find a DVD recorder with a hard drive -LRB- except for Philips -RRB- . Now a hard rive recorder comes out at last and the DVD part is missing !!?? 	Video Recorder
From the posted reviews , it seems like there are two outcomes for purchasers of the Replay TV . Either it works perfectly out of the box - and the user is ecstatic , or it fails miserably . No middle ground . I 'm one of the latter . <p> After spending two hours hooking it up -LRB- you will notice inconsistencies between the quick setup guide , the manual , and the onscreen instructions -RRB- and trying multiple alternatives for connecting , the picture quality was similar to watching something in sepia tone . I tried the first of four calls to Customer Support -LRB- was on hold for two hours without an indication of wait time , until I was disconnected - presumably because support hours were over . I tried twice more over the next two days -LRB- all prior to Christmas -RRB- and never could get through . On Christmas night , after 11\/2 hours of hold time , I did get a person - after another 11\/2 hours of troubleshooting , including being put back on hold on a number of occasions , the resolution was to send it back . -LRB- at my own expense , with a minimum 10 day turnaround time . It was clear that this turn-around time would not impact the normal 30 day return policy for Amazon . -RRB- At this point , I 've decided I 've invested far too much energy into a product -LRB- and company -RRB- which is not ready for the consumer market . For the limited time that I had it working , I would echo other reviewers comments about difficulties in changing channels , lack of knowledgeable support , and most aggravating -- the 4 day window for activating the product . If the product is not activitated within 4 days , not only does the channel guide features not work -LRB- which is understandable -RRB- , but you will not be able to use the TV without disconnecting the device . I should also point out that customer support does not reply to emails either . 	Video Recorder
I love the hauppage , but the Totalmedia extreme software which is included is the worst software I have encountered in years . I run this program on a Vista . \* It typically takes 3-4 minutes for the program to load \* Anytime you shut off the program you have to restart your computer to make it work again . \* If you use the program for any length of time the screen will go black and you have to restart your computer \* The device settings -LRB- brightness , etc -RRB- do not work . \* This player can not play its own files correctly . Replaying the mp4 files on the player causes a green screen . But on the windows 7 Media Player the files work okay . \* Often when there is action on the screen , and attempting to take a screen shot , the screen is cut in the middle , slightly off from the cut top frame and the bottom . \* Often any recording longer than 1 hour and 15 minutes will not be saved . I could go on , I have used this player for around 40 hours and have found numerous problems . 	Video Recorder
Very handy useful device that has made me a coach potato ! This will truly change the way you watch TV for good . I was very please the moment I opened the box . Everything in the box is nicely organized and all the cables you could possibly need are included , which made the setup quick and easy -LRB- still had to wait for the software download - about 2 hours -RRB- . Give this thing a week to learn what you like and program all your favorite shows and you too will be hooked . The only downside I can think of is you ca n't record two shows at the same time . Plus , the image quality will take a hit when viewing `` live '' and recorded TV . Since the TiVo is viewed through your TVs composite A\/V input you could switch b\/w regular cable and TiVo TV if there is a recording conflict or you want to see a better image from time to time . But these are very minor flaws , which will improve as technology improves . For now , I am very pleased and much fatter : -RRB- 	Video Recorder
Product worked great ... delivery was fast ... Standard definition is the best choice for viewing ... HDTV is only zooming into that picture ... it cuts off the top and bottom . Otherwise very satisfied . 	Video Recorder
Replay TV met nearly every expectation I had , and then some . Very easy to set up - it dials out to get the program guide and you 're good to go . My set up includes s-video and stereo cables out to the TV , and s-video and stero cables in from the DVD . I do n't have a cable box , but it includes an `` IR blaster '' to control your set-top box . One surprise - you ca n't record one show while watching another like a VCR . However you CAN watch a previously recorded show while recording another . Also : There is a delay in Replay which causes the image from your DVD to become out of synch with the sound played through your home theater . That being said , imagine watching all your favorite shows whenever you want - sweet . 	Video Recorder
The Directv receiver is a good product and records your showes that you would like to watch . One draw back if you get a used one you will have to get a Computer card that has to be from Directv as the one that comes with it has to be up dated to the Receiver . But after everything said and did , It workes great !!! 	Video Recorder
I 've heard so much rave about the TiVo , and how it is so helpful . If you are a 9 to 5 worker , get rid of the dusty VCR , and definitely , pick this up . It is very helpful and fills the needs of anyone who ca n't catch their programming . Appearance : The new Series 2 DVR is a lot more sleek and distinguishes a better look then its old Series 1 . It is a dark gray , with smooth surfacing . The front is a darkish white , applied with the TiVo logo , and a backlight , which has four adjustable brightness settings . Below is the color bar . On the left it is green , and when you are recording , the right is red . Also when ever you hit a button on the remote , about half of the bar on the right changes to orange , indicating you hit a button . Features : Here 's the goods . This thing is packed with your hopes , and they come true . The huge main feature , is recording any program you desire on TV . There are many ways of doing this . First off , you can just simply record it . You can also do a Season Pass , which records all of your show times , no matter what time it is at . It has a thumbs up , and thumbs and thumbs down , to indicate if you like the show or not . You can give it up to three thumbs down or up . This also creates your WishList , which gives it a feeling of what you like . Then it depends on which one you buy , the 80 minute or 40 minute . Go with the 80 minute , which is what I should have done . And of course , controlling live TV . You can pause , rewind , and slow-mo live TV . Remember , you can only have up to 30 minutes of live TV until the starting point starts going . Controller : It is a simple controller , easy to use . The guide button to the main menu is the TiVo logo at the top of the controller . The TV power button is to the left . The Live TV button is to the right near the top . The four direction button is in the middle . Then the TV input and Info button are on oppisite sides of the left and right buttons on the four direction button . Below are the window and guide button . And finally , there is the select button . To the side of that are the thumb up and down buttons . Then , making an H shape are the volume up and down button . Then in the middle are the mute and record button . Then on the right side is the channel button . This button also works for Page up and dowm . Then in the middle is the central control button . The play , pause , slow , fast forward , and rewind are equipped here . Then to the sides of the slow button are the 8-second replay button , and the skip button . Then finally at the bottom are the numbers , then the clear and Enter\/Last button . Tips : - When fast forwarding , you can use the skip button to go to the 15 minute intervals . Works well with a long program . - To reduce the info screen , use the right direction key on the four direction button . - Better organization , organize your programs into folders , which is much easier to navigate . - Want to scroll through something faster ? Use the page up and down buttons , which is also the channel button . - To do step by step , press pause then hit fast forward . 	Video Recorder
One of my ReplayTV boxes is a 4500 model purchased in 2002 . It has NEVER needed repair . On the RARE occasion -LRB- less than a Windows-based computer -RRB- it hangs , just reboot it by pushing and holding the power button until it reboots itself - instructions are easily found in the manual -RRB- . In the beginning when I had questions and had n't read the manual , I found their Tech Support people to be fast , exceptionally helpful , knowledgable , and friendly . The machine is either recording or being watched or both nearly 24\/7 and is still going strong after all this time . Love , love , love it ! How Tivo users live without commerical advance , commercial skip , or 30-second skip is unfathomable ! 	Video Recorder
I Own 160 H model -LRB- for about 4 years -RRB- . And recently I got another DVR taht comes with DISH . The replaytv unit is vastly superior in every way -LRB- well , except I wish the replay unit had more than one tuner -RRB- . The only other problem I have -LRB- which affects both units -RRB- is the electronic listings are wrong enough to be annoying . Once you get a DVR , you will never go back to a VCR . I suggest you get at least 160 hours -LRB- more if more than one person will be using it -RRB- . . Reasons will become clear with use -LRB- IE : you tend to save the last 3 or 4 shows of everything , so if you go on vacation -LRB- etc -RRB- they will be there waITING FOR YOU . THE DISH DVR : -LRB- BOO -RRB- : There are too many crappy issues with the DISH unit to even remember them all -LRB- here are a few I can think of -RRB- : When you hit pause -LRB- and go away -RRB- . . It will start playing again by itself , so you miss your show -LRB- which is the point of the DVR in the first place -RRB- . . And , it will not let you rewind when it starts playing automatically . It probably fills up the hard drive . . but there is no way to `` not '' fill up the hard drive because of the way the thing records shows for you -LRB- FIFO style -RRB- . When you pause to see something the pause bar that pops up -LRB- to let you know you pauded presumably ? -RRB- covers about a third of the screen -LRB- enough to cause you to miss 100 percent of whatever it was you wanted to see -RRB- . NOTE that you can hit the arrow to go into slomo -LRB- from pause -RRB- , but it skips away from what you want to see -LRB- so you are still screwed here -RRB- . Trust me on this , Im not even sure a kid would have the patience to find something to see in slomo with this thing . When you record your shows , replayTV lets you organize stuff in whatever manner that suits you -LRB- very convenient after setup -RRB- . . The DISH unit puts the most recent recordings in a list , with newest first . Sounds like no big deal , wait till you have over a hundred , and if you were able to compare this against the replay unit , you would understand . 	Video Recorder
I have been a happy Tivo customer for several years . Recently I purchased a 40 hour unit as a gift for my mom . Tivo fails to mention that when you buy the DVR , you ca n't actually digitally record anything without also buying the monthly service . It 's a usless box without the service , so if you want to give this as a gift , do n't , unless you want to stick the gift receiver with a useless box or a big bill . Who wants to get a gift with such a huge string attached ? 	Video Recorder
At first when I received this product , I was excited to be able to record TV shows and my Xbox 360 gameplay . After hours of looking at many tutorials on YouTube on how to make the quality better , nothing worked . The software -LRB- ArcSoft ShowBiz -RRB- works great , and the hardware is good , just not as good of quality as other people had and how I wanted it to be . I tried rendering it with Sony Vegas Pro 10 , and even that could n't make it any better . I used different capturing programs , and they were all the same . I 'm not saying this product is bad , I 'm just saying it 's not what I wanted . 	Video Recorder
Excellent device for capturing video , music , photos , etc. . Records programs easily from a television , VCR , & satellight receiver . The included conversion program allows one to convert previously recorded programs for play within the AV700 . AV700 is also compatable with ULEADS Video Studio 10plus , recording program . Ulead has a batch converter , to gather programs , convert them transfer for viewing to to the AV700 -LRB- using the widows WMA format -RRB- . LIke wise Nero 's mpeg4 -LRB- nero digital -RRB- is not compatable with the AV700 . The AV700 is easy to use , excellent visual clarity and the external speakers are mediocre -LRB- but useful if headphones not plugged in -RRB- . Yahoo 's offered TV listings work great with the AV700 for presetting video recordings automatically ! I have seen several other competitors 4 '' viewing screens , which in my opinion are way to small for viewing . The AV700 screen is a nice size for viewing without eye strain . The games offered are just ok . I recommend this device . 	Video Recorder
Delivery time was quick , product packaging was great & item working great . I am so glad I ordered it . 	Video Recorder
This mini DVR is a great little security device . It has only one set of input and output connections for the video & audio so you can record audio & video with a security camera that has a built in microphone or just use a regular security camera -LRB- no audio -RRB- for area recording . This DVR has all the features of a full size security DVR in a small size . Manual is a little hard to follow at first but after using the features a few times you will get the feel of how things work . Adding a video signal splitter box to add more cameras makes this mini DVR into a full security system . The video and audio produced are of good quality . Uses SD memory cards up to 32mb and recording can be viewed using function buttons on DVR connected to a monitor or TV using RCA plug convert adapter -LRB- supplied -RRB- or the SD card can be removed and view on any computer with a USB port and windows media player , and the supplied SD card reader . Also includes two sets of RCA audio - video cables . Been using Mini DVR for several months for home security ; works great . Can be used in small stores as a backup to a video tape system , or record lonely hallways activity , etc. . 	Video Recorder
After using a Showstopper ReplayTV for years with 120 hours , I needed one that would work over ethernet after I switch to VOIP phone service . I love the software improvements over the Showstopper . I used to do 3 skip for a 3 minute jump , now you can just use the right arrow to jump to the end of the commercials 90 % of the time . 1 key commercial advance is very nice . I also use DV archive to watch shows recorded on this new replay on my PCs . Great for resolving family conflicts on what to watch . 	Video Recorder
I 've had one of these for years . It 's been really handy for recording episodes of my favorite shows and seeking out movies that I 'd be interested in . Finally decided I do n't want to pay for the subscription anymore , but the DVR and service have been great . 	Video Recorder
Of course , if someone has a problem with something they are going to complain about it . The few people that have had a problem with their TIVO are no exception . I myself just got one and i think it is absolutely great . <p> Contrary to what others are saying it does n't degrade picture quality ! I use the video jacks it came with instead of the cable wire . It 's the use of the cable wire that will degrade the quality because the signal has to go from the cable box to the vcr to the tivo to the television . If you use the video the signal goes directly from the cable box to the TIVO . <p> Also you do not have to pay the monthly service . If you just want the pause and rewind live tv function and if you want to set your own channel and time then you do n't need to pay for the updated tv grid which allows for the season pass function . <p> The setup itself was very easy and straight forward . The only confusing part may be the ir probes , which i mention later . <p> It did n't take 10 hours or 2 days to set up like some have said . For me it took about 2 hours to format the harddrive , but it 's not like you ca n't start using it right away . You can use the pause live tv function while it 's formating . You just have to wait before you can pick shows to record . <p> The basic setting , which gives you the maximum 40 hours , is indeed very tolerable unlike what others are saying . It looks like a streaming video off of the internet on a CABLE MODEM , it gets pixelated at a few points . But the best setting is still what I chose it leaves me with 11 hours of time , which is plenty . <p> The only thing i hate about it is the way it changes channels . You have to attach these probe-like things to your cable box . When you change the channels the signal goes from the tivo to the cable box via a wire attached to the back of the tivo that goes to the cable box by way of the probes . This can get annoying at first because you have to find the right codes and settings . Once you find it about 10 minutes later you should be alright . Channel surfing can become stressing though because of this long delay to change the channel , so i suggest you use the guide . I timed it and it takes 7 seconds to switch a channel . <p> If you are worrying about the daily call and if they are free , you can check tivo.com and they have a list of the numbers the device calls to . I live in an area that is n't too major and i had two numbers to pick from . They 've added new numbers since then . Also if someone calls or uses the phone while tivo is on it , it will automatically hang up and you wont know the difference , tivo will just make the calls later . <p> All in all it 's money well spent . Remember someone is going to have a problem , it 's that way with anything . And if it 's a headache for them they will nitpick everything about the system and most likely exaggerate it .

The 5160 is my second ReplayTV unit . I also have a 4508 that I just love . <p> My problem with the 5160 is that you have to download a humongous operating system update from SonicBlue 's network before you can do anything with it , and SonicBlue 's network is n't robust enough to handle all the download requests it seems to be getting this Christmas season . My connection kept timing out an hour or two into the download , and as a result it took me three days of trying to finally complete the setup process . Meanwhile , SonicBlue 's tech support department was no help at all . Sometimes I could n't even get through ; other times the wait to speak to a representative was over an hour . <p> I 'm a fan of SonicBlue 's products , but I 'd hold off on the 5160 until SonicBlue works the kinks out . To capitalize on the holiday buying season , SonicBlue seems to have rushed these units out the door before they were ready . 	Video Recorder
I love the concept of the product . It 's great when it works . Today , I 'm sending it in because they say the hard drive needs to be replaced . I do n't know if I will send it in . The exchange price is almost the cost of a new one . Funny how it waited one month after the warrenty was up . This one is really the fourth one that I 've had . The first three did n't work out of the box . In order to get this one , I had a very patient Best Buy employee go through their stock until we found one that did work . In the end , there was only one left on the shelf . 	Video Recorder
I bought a TiVo because my stepmom just raved about it because she does n't get to watch live TV now that my brother is a toddler . I did n't think I would really get much use out of it because I do n't watch TV that much -- I was n't going to buy one but I got it for $ 160 plus the $ 100 rebate so I figured a loss of $ 60 would n't be TOO bad . But I LOVE TiVo ! The only gripes I have are that you ca n't change the channel while it 's recording on the satellite and I 've had to restart it twice when it had only been hooked up for 2 days . But I was told that it was because so many services were being activated after the holidays\/to get the rebate in etc. and if the problem persisted to make another service call . My only regret is not getting the 80 hour TiVo because if you record on high quality with the 40 hour you only get 18-20 hours of recording time . I have been using medium quality , but I tested the low quality and it 's still better than using VHS tapes to catch the shows I miss during the day . I recommend TiVo for anyone who watches TV . Now I do n't have to worry about rushing home to see my favorite shows or worry about setting the VCR and buying VHS tapes etc. . 	Video Recorder
I have both an old 2000 series and a 4000 series and if I could only keep on add on to my tv it would be replay tv . My 4000 series replay had some problems and the service staff at sonic blue were great . They had me send it back immediately and they shipped me a new one quickly . Try to get on with automatic commercial skip . It does n't always work but most of the time it is great . They do n't put it in the 5500 series , so it would be worth it to get a 4000 or 5000 series if you can . 	Video Recorder
This product will forever change the way you watch TV . Suddenly , you are in complete control of what you watch and when . I do n't watch less TV , but I do watch the TV that I want to watch . <p> I would n't recommend this for someone who is n't somewhat comfortable with technology . And yes , it does crash at times , but the benefits far outweigh the inconvenience . <p> Purchase at least 80 hours of storage time if you plan to record on medium quality which I recommend . <p> The commercial skip feature is great . Ok ... it is n't perfect , but it is by far the best available . This feature will be GOING AWAY with the introduction of the 5500 series due to pressure from the entertainment industry . Take a look at the article below . <p> ------------- ReplayTV has agreed to remove two features from its product that infuriated the ad and broadcasting industries even more than they delighted consumers . <p> ReplayTV 's new 5500 model , on sale next month , has been re-engineered so that it can not automatically skip entire commercial breaks without recording them . Nor will it be able to send recorded programming over the internet to other ReplayTV users outside a home network . <p> But the devices will still indefinitely store many hours of programming , while enabling users to skip manually in 30-second segments through recorded commercials . <p> Two years ago , a consortium of movie and TV studios sued Sonicblue the former owner of ReplayTV and now in Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection for abetting copyright infringement with the device s commercial-skipping feature . The company and its technology was subsequently acquired by D&M Holdings of Japan . <p> D&M executives insist that the dropping of these features was voluntary , although critics see the move as capitulation rather than an accommodation . Jim Hollingsworth , president of D&M s ReplayTV division , denies this . We did this on our own . There was no coercion . We will take features out because we want to be a positive force in the industry . <p> But Jeff Joseph , vp and spokesman for the Consumer Electronics Association , is not convinced : Companies are under considerable pressure to bow to the wishes of the entertainment industry . This is unfair and anticompetitive . If advertisers and broadcasters are seeing their traditional business model threatened , then it would behoove them to consider alternative business models .

I 've had my replayTV for a few weeks now connected to my cable-TV . Here are my impressions : <p> What I like with ReplayTV : - Works great . Revolutionizes TV watching . - Skips most commercials on major networks -- really nice ! - 30-second forward skip , to jump through commercials that were n't skipped . - ... BR -RRB- - Ethernet port allows me to download shows I was n't able to watch onto my PC , and burn them as a VCD to see them later . - Nice user interface . - Nice channel guide . - Appears to be the best DVR for the money . <p> What could be better : - Changing channels when viewing TV through the replayTV takes 5 seconds . - System response lags a little -- I 'm used to appliances that respond immediately . - Can only record 1 show at a time -- I would be willing to pay a little more money to have a system with 2 or 3 tuners . - When you 've programmed several shows that overlap , it 's difficult to tell which ones will get recorded and which ones wo n't . It 's even more difficult to understand how to change their priority . - Ca n't specify to record only new shows , and not re-runs . - The progressive video output does n't work with my JVC TV -LRB- although that may just be due to the TV -RRB- - Does n't always detect commercials on all channels . - The system is finicky . If it works , it works great , but it clearly has bugs . It occasionally fails to connect at night with the phone line -LRB- this is discussed in many user groups -RRB- , and has crashed a few times . <p> Features I found useless : - Storing and displaying pictures -- really too slow to be useable . - The 5 -LRB- ! -RRB- different video outputs on the rear of the device -- why do I care ? - The digital audio output -- which supposedly sounds just like the normal audio outputs . - Sharing shows over the internet with other users -- it just takes too long to be practical .

"I bought this to record The Closer and Psych off one of my Comcast boxes . The HD PVR will change the channel , and start to record , but it always halts recording . I tried the capture software that came with it , and SageTV . I read elsewhere that this may be caused by the power supply , but I did n't want to fiddle with that , so I 'm sending it back . I 'll try the Colossus next . <ahref=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004OVE2B4/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/183-3419029-3532167""> Hauppauge Colossus PCI Express Internal HD-PVR </a> "	Video Recorder
I WOULDNT WISH THE TIVO ON MY WORST ENEMY . A PAIN TO HOOK TO A PHONE . TO INTRICATELY CONNECTED TO YOUR OTHER RESOURCES TO EVEN TRY . I SUGGEST BUYING A DVR FROM YOUR CABLE SUPPLIER . ITS LIKE BREATHING , TIVO IS LIKE DROWING . 	Video Recorder
I have had two of these units , and both were sent back -LRB- I am using with SageTV HTPC and a DirecTV signal source -RRB- . The first one , a `` D2 '' version , took forever to get working , and then it would only work intermittently -LRB- would get the dreaded black screen and `` no signal '' or `` error '' -RRB- . I tried for many weeks to fix the problem as I ran across many hundreds of posts in discussion threads about how to get it to work -LRB- this , btw , is never a good sign -RRB- , but to no avail . I sent it back and Amazon sent me a new one . This was an `` E1 '' version so I thought I was set -LRB- a common comment in the boards was that the E1 's were supposed to work -RRB- . This version did work better for about a week , then it quit working entirely and after another week of trouble shooting I could never get it to work again . I took it to a buddy 's house with a similar set up as mine and he also could not get it to work so I know it was the unit . This one just went back as well , and now it looks like Amazon does not want to replace it . Note that they are refunding my money -LRB- nothing but good things to say about Amazon -RRB- , but I guess they have decided either I am a scammer of some sort or this machine is a lemon so they are not replacing it . I ca n't blame them , the boards are full of folks who have sent them back and they are probably doing me a favor . When it did work , it did a great job capturing the video in HD , but it would take from 5 to 20 seconds to tune in both the audio and video of a channel when you changed stations . This was OK for capturing and watching later , but not really great for live tv . Do yourself and your girlfriend\/wife a favor and wait until a more reliable solution comes out . Because once you get it , you can count on about 30 hours disappearing from your life with only about a 30 % chance of being fully satisfied . 	Video Recorder
Sales people talk about pausing live TV . If you are really using TIVO you do not watch any live TV . -LRB- You can not fast forward in live mode because that part of the program has not arrived . -RRB- <p> TIVO is used to RECORD the BEST of the BEST of the BEST programming on your set of channels and have it ready for you . -LRB- The best of 35 channel is better than finding somthing in real time on 200 channels -RRB- <p> TIVO Comes down to time management . There is not enough time to watch all the TV there is , so you only want to watch YOUR BEST shows , TIVO will have them . Check now playing and watch what is there . If you have set thing up correctly there should be better programming in Now Playing than on all your tapes . If not you have other things in your life than TV . Tis better to watch a good show you have not seen than rewatch one have . <p> People talk about how channel surfing is slower . With TIVO you should not be channel surfing at all . It is a waist of time -LRB- TIVO has found lots of good shows on channels I never watched before . They did not have enough shows I like to make reading the guide worthwhile -RRB- . You should never wait for anything . You should spend very little time -LRB- 5 min . per week is a lot -RRB- deciding what to record or how much space is on the disk -LRB- TIVO keeps what it can as long as it can -RRB- . Leave your season passes in , that way when battel bots comes back next season TIVO will have it for you . Most one hour shows can be viewed in 40 min . and rewound in 60 seconds if you do not use the skip to 15 min . mark or skip to end function . I shave at least on hour off a football game , even with my own instant replays . I have the 49ers on a wish list . I get all the games , that is easy but if they have a spot on NFL films TIVO will record that for me too . Can you imagine TV without a VCR ? Replacing your VCR with TIVO is a bigger improvement than adding a VCR to your TV . I have 3 Super VHS VCRs , which I paid more than $ 400 each , and 500 + tapes . I used the VCRs to `` time shift '' . They can all change cable box channels just like TIVO . Unlike TIVO tape can not play and record independently at the same time . I have not used any of the VCRs in the last year . My grand son has played some of his tapes . I quit renting movies , TIVO has more good stuff than I have time to watch . <p> My first TIVO is over a year old and still working fine . I added 2 more units 2 mo. after the first one . The last addition is a second TIVO remote for in our bedroom . That way I can have a remote of my own to fast forward or turn the TV and Sound system off after my wife has fallen asleep . Last night she was still gripping the thing 3 hours after she fell asleep . 	Video Recorder
I think it 's very interesting that this has become such a highly touted video toy . It 's actually become a verb ... `` I Tivo 'd it . '' I bought my series 2 \/ 80 hour model two years ago , and have hated it from day one . I finally pulled the plug on it last week , and ordered a MOXI box from our local cable company . Here are a few of my complaints : - First , I 'm using this with a plasma HDTV , Digital Cable , and a surround sound system . 1 . The setup is ridiculously complex when you 're using it with the above components . The manual is useless , Best Buy 's `` Geek Squad '' could n't figure it out , and I ended up scouring online Blogs and discussion groups to come up with a jury-rigged setup . 2 . It does n't record in HD , meaning you need to have two different TV Inputs connected -LRB- and switch back and forth -RRB- to access the Tivo capabilities . This requires two splitters , which complicate the connectivity , and reduce the picture and sound quality . 3 . It also means there 's no recording on the fly . You need to manually switch to a different input and program it to record . 4 . The reliability has been horrendous , as far as depending on the device to record shows on the right channel at the right time . I 've probably got about a 75 % hit rate , meaning you ca n't depend on it to record things . 5 . Since it does n't record HiDef , you need to program it to record the `` non-HD '' channels , and of course playback is then in non-HD mode when you want to watch your favorite shows . Why buy an HDTV and pay for digital cable and the extra channels if you ca n't record something and have it played back in HD and stereo surround ? When I called to cancel the service , they told me that they 're coming out with a new model that will record in Hi-Def , but of course they wo n't give you credit for the $ 239 and two years of frustration you experienced with the old model . For regular TV and non-digital connectivity , it might be great . But if you 've got digital cable , surround sound , and HDTV , it 's definitely not . It 's going on my company 's bulletin board , and I 'll sell it to anyone who 's interested in it , and will of course provide a full disclosure that I think it 's a lousy piece of video hardware . Did n't like it , would n't recommend it , never again . 	Video Recorder

I 'm so sorry that I could n't use this product . I 'm not very good on the computer end and did n't realize that this product would not work with the new `` black box '' and digital tuner etc. . Still do n't understand it completely , but the technician that came to my house to set it all up said I could n't use it . With this new system coming upon us I feel that when things that wo n't work on your old TV should state that it would be obsolete after a few weeks . I 'm a senior and had no idea that this would or could happen . However , the service and cooperation of all was superb . The customer from whom I dealt with was so friendly and helpful and gracious as well as Amazon themselves . No complaints !!! Just think for us who have n't the knowledge the obsolete items should be marked . Something of that importance needs to be known . I truly have no idea on how or if this product works . It was rated very high when I bought it , but for me it did n't rate at all . Thank you !!!! 	Video Recorder
I see quite a few comments on this page about modems and hard drives dying on Series 1 or Series 2 Philips DVR 's -LRB- aka , Tivos -RRB- . Between my family and friends , I know of 12 Tivos that have had NO hard drive or modem problems whatsoever ! The first one was purchased almost 4 years ago , too ! The two Tivos that we have had problems with are both Philips Series 1 models . Both have had modem failures . Both have been connected to phone lines that have experienced surges -- my brother 's during a thunderstorm and mine due to a 40 + year old wall jack that corroded . I think the folks with multiple Tivo failures need to look at their phone systems ! I do agree , though , that having to pay $ 80 just to talk to a techie about my dead modem was a bit excessive . I will not do that again . $ 25 or $ 60 modem replacement kits are available . 	Video Recorder
With a 5-star concept like this , how could I give it only three stars ? <p> 1 . Set-up problems prevented me from using it the night I took it home , a call to tech support -LRB- the next day , when they opened ... hello , when are most people using a device like this ? -RRB- remedied the situation . <p> 2 . Three hours for TIVO to download my cable provider 's schedule , with hard-disk grinding away . In my bedroom at 1am , this was n't well-received . ; - -RRB- <p> 3 . The most annoying thing to me : if I WANT to watch TV with no TIVO-meddling , it is impossible . You know how you can turn off your VCR if you want to just channel-surf ? If you turn off TIVO , you do n't get a signal to your TV . C'mon folks , this is a pretty easy feature to implement , since it 's been a part of every VCR made in the past 15 years -LRB- or more ? -RRB- It 's irritating and kind of Big Brother-y . Let ME control how and what I watch ... that 's the whole idea ! <p> 4 . Channel surfing in general is slow ... for us remote-control jockeys , the delay when switching from channel to channel is mildly annoying . I 'd rather have the recording delayed than my channel surfing ... <p> 5 . Menu options are poorly implemented , IMHO . Too much paging from screen to screen , and no quick way to return four or five levels up ... I found myself backing out of sub-menus all the time . Try this in your darkened bedroom for fun some time ! <p> I also bought a ReplayTV last year and took it back too for various 'n sundry reasons -LRB- one of which was that it would n't work with my satellite TV provider -RRB- . I may not be the most forgiving consumer . However , I think the idea is SO GOOD that the consumer electronics manufacturers should hear the truth so they can improve the product . Hopefully someone will get it right in the near future . BTW , my `` TIVO '' was badged as a Sony , I guess Sony bought them out recently . Do n't think the Sony is a new device . All my other A\/V gear is Sony , so when I saw their brand-name I pounced -LRB- thinking maybe they 'd addressed some of the problems -RRB- . 	Video Recorder
Poorly designed product . Quality of picture is excellent is you can ever get it to record . The TV guide looses it 's information every night . I have to recycle the power constantly just to get the picture back . I called Sony to see if there was some setup that would fix the problem . After waiting for about 45 mins I got a tech that could barely understand what the product was . It was the most clueless helpdesk person I have ever talked too . I have never purchased an electronic product that failed this miserably to function as advertized . After spending numerous hours on this I returned it before my wife took a hammer to it .

Works very good with windows XP . Very pleased with operation . No windows 7 driver is the only problem I have found . 	Video Recorder
I have had this recorder for about 2 months now without the issues some speak of here . Has recorded every show without issue . The thing you may have to watch for is if they change the shows length from one week to the next as it will only record the first hour if they extended it to 2 hours . Other than this , I have yet to have a problem with it . Unlike the few others here I would recommend it . 	Video Recorder
I could never leave the house again , thanks to my TIVO , they are upgradeable , and have the BEST program guide\/interface of anyone . There Tivo to go is very glitchy at this point , but the TIVO service itself is top notch , I am about to get my 3rd tivo box . The two I have , this and another have acted flaky occasionaly , but it was usually assosiated with one of there updates . It is slower recently , but still very useable . The only hardware issues I have either fixed themself or on one occasion I realized that I was baking my tivo in my entertainment center -LRB- oven -RRB- it needs room to breathe , especially if you have a crappy comcast cable box near it , the two create a lot of heat , just make sure its not enclosed or near a heat vent . Overall it will change your life , and how you watch tv . A lot of the problems people have had in a lot of these reviews is due to not knowing how to use the box , read the directions carefully .

Superb , inexpensive and flexible recorder for a single camera . Worked out of the box using the included 1GB SD card but would not operate at all using the 16GB SDHC card I bought at the same time . Would not boot up or work in any way . Went to -LRB- ... -RRB- and downloaded the June 2009 firmware file . Extracted from zip and transferred to the 1GB card . Placed the card into the CPC800 and went into menu . Selected SD Card and update system . Took 2 seconds . That cured the problem . Now can record for dozens of hours and can loop back around once the 16GB is full without intervention . This gives an essentially perpetual recording capability . Great little unit with many features , including variable resolution and recording quality . 	Video Recorder
this humax tivo has all the same functionality as a regular tivo -LRB- as far as i know -RRB- . it works flawlessly . i installed a wireless usb adapter so that i could hook it up to my network and it worked without a problem . i did need a phone line to set it up initially , but this is n't usually a problem for most people . there is no noise coming from the machine and it is n't cheap at all . it appears very solid and i am really glad i bought it .

This is by far the best capture card I 've ever owned . It has it 's own built in processor so you do n't need to worry about the recording eating your computer ' insides . It 's a fantastic product that even has a scheduled recording option so it will record while you are away . The capture quality if phenomenal , and I 've never been happier with such good quality on such a small file size . The HD PVR does have a few faults , one of them being the awful . m2ts video file it saves your video in . Luckily , the software included has a file converter which converts the files in the highly versatile . mp4 file . Overall , the quality is great , even when using the SD input on the front . I have found that the HD PVR 's SD quality is better than that of a Dazzle DVC 100 , which records only in SD . A great product . 	Video Recorder
After receiving the item , I set it up , and learned the basic features in little time . This unit works and functions great , and it 's fairly easy to use . In fact , the video quality is comparable to and the audio quality better . I 'm very happy with this unit . 	Video Recorder

Hi everyone . I had hoped that when I bought my ReplayTV 5040 that it would work fine . BUZZZ-wrong answer . It died on me about 6 weeks after I bought it . -LRB- Infinite reboot problem -RRB- Alright , no big deal , I 'll just send it back . On January 27th I called technical support and after some troubleshooting and it was determined that I had to send it in . I was told that I would have a new unit 10 days after they got my unit . I sent it in and UPS delivered it to ReplayTV on January 31st . It was delivered at 10:09 AM and signed for by `` Cooper . '' Two weeks later I sent an email to technical support asking for a status report . No response . Two more days went by and I sent another email to which they replied with this cryptic quote : `` Your RMA is in process and will be fulfilled as soon as possible . '' Not very helpful . <p> After patiently waiting for nearly a month , on or around February 27th I decided that I should try to give someone a call , so I called in and they had no record of my unit or even me ! The guy finally said he would have to put me on hold . I held for over 30 minutes and then got sent into his voice mail . I immediately called back and had to tell my story all over again . The new person I talked to was very polite , found my information and said she would `` escalate my case . '' Great , I thought , finally ! After more discussion she said I should have my unit very soon . I told her that I would like a confirmation email when the unit was shipped . <p> March 6th rolls around and I still have not heard anything from anyone at SonicBlue so I called in again . This time I got a man who was sorry to hear about my case after I told him the story . This time he gave me a case number and told me the he would `` escalate '' my case to the supervisory level . I told him that I though that had already been done ! He told me that it should now get some high level action . I ask him to send me an email when the unit has been shipped . <p> Today is March 11th and I since I have n't received an email , I decide to call tech support and see if they can give me a status report . I happen to talk to the same woman that I spoke to on February 27th . She apologizes to me and says that my case has been `` escalated to a higher level '' and that she will check with her supervisor for the status . After about 10 minutes she gets back on the phone and tells me that her supervisor told her that the unit should have been shipped , but that they do n't know for sure . -LRB- At this point I am taking everything they say with a grain of salt ! -RRB- She suggests that I call back in two days and they should be able to tell me for sure if the unit has shipped . <p> That is where things stand right now . I ca n't say that I can give any advice based on this report , but I thought people should be aware of the situation . -------------- <p> Epilogue : The day after I posted the above review I had an email exchange with other people at SonicBlue and they sent me a new unit 2nd day FedEx . Once I got to the right people they were very responsive . 	Video Recorder
After getting the Philips HDR612 TiVo our TV viewing experience has changed for the better ! It is very easy to pick your favorite shows and have Tivo automatically record them .

Imagine watching what you want on TV , when you want . That is the basic premise of ReplayTV . Once you get one of these things into your house you will never watch TV the same again . <p> Tell the Replay which shows you want it to record from it 's simple point-and-click channel guide and it will record that show for you every week . No hunting for tapes , no complicated timers to set , no flashing `` 12:00 '' on the front . <p> The Replay makes things so simple you will not be able to live without it . Anytime you want to watch TV you will have shows you actually like available . It will skip through most commercial breaks in about 1 second AUTOMATICALLY . Phone rings , doorbell rings , need to check on the kids or go the bathroom , just hit the pause button and you can pick right back up where you left off . You can control live TV . Amazing play in a sports event , just hit the instant replay button and watch it again . <p> Unlike Tivo there are no monthly fees to pay - after you buy it you will receive program guide updates and software upgrades free for life . <p> If you forget to set the replay to record a show you can get a friend to send it to you over the internet . Again it is point-and-click easy . <p> Take a chance & order one today - there is a reason why 95 % of the people who have a DVR -LRB- digital video recorder -RRB- say they would recommend it to their friends . You will not be disapointed . 	Video Recorder
No more scheduling your time around TV programs ! A friend had gotten his months earlier , and I did n't believe what he was saying . Finally when I needed a VCR replacement , I decided to get the HDR212 . This is an amazing product . <p> I 've had mine for over a year now , and I simply can not imagine watching TV again without it . Pause when you have to run into the kitchen , or tend to something else at home . I normally start watching TV about 20 minutes after a program has started just so I can FF through commercials . $ -LRB- money -RRB- a month for the TiVo service is worth the money . The TiVo guide is easy to use , and beats trying to grab a TV Guide or the newspaper to figure out when your program is on , and the season pass is just extremely convenient . This is the way TV was meant to be -- arranged around _ our _ time . <p> Downsides : 1 . Watching TV again _ without _ TiVo is a real pain ! 2 . Phillips warranty is pathetic -- 90 days parts & labor ... beyond that , $ -LRB- money -RRB- for a repair . 3 . 6 + hours at Best quality -LRB- 20 hours ... yeah , whatever ... -RRB- is n't enough . If you travel all week , by the time you get home , something 's bound to have been erased . No problem though -- I bought an 80GB HD and upgraded the TiVo myself , and now I have 31 hours at best quality ! -LRB- Check out the TiVo Hinsdale How-To guide on how to upgrade your TiVo -RRB- . On the positive -LRB- ? -RRB- side , my cable provider 's quality is -LRB- bad -RRB- enough , that I often could n't tell the difference between Best quality -LRB- 6 + hours -RRB- , and High quality -LRB- 9 + hours -RRB- using the original -LRB- before upgrade -RRB- TiVo capacity . <p> Now , if only TiVo could do something about the -LRB- bad -RRB- service from my cable provider !

It 's somewhat amazing that this DVR and its little brother the DHG-HDD5250 are still listed on Amazon -LRB- via third-party sellers -RRB- , and they 're selling for good prices on eBay , even though Sony discontinued them in November 2005 . They 've developed a cult following for being among the tiny number of HDTV DVRs that do n't require a subscription fee for their program guide , and can be used for over-the-air -LRB- OTA -RRB- broadcasts . They can also be used with cable TV ; to receive encrypted digital cable , they need a CableCard from the cable provider . That program guide , the TV Guide On Screen -LRB- TVGOS -RRB- system from Rovi -LRB- formerly Macrovsion , formerly Gemstar -RRB- , is supported by advertising on the guide screens , rather than by user fees . TVGOS devices receive it via signals `` piggybacked '' onto over-the-air -LRB- OTA -RRB- broadcast TV signals , from host stations in -LRB- ideally -RRB- each broadcast area . Unfortunately , these DVRs depend so heavily on TVGOS that if they ca n't get a usable TVGOS signal , they lose about 90 % of their functionality . Even the clock setting comes from TVGOS , and there 's no way to set the clock manually . If you do n't have TVGOS , you ca n't even schedule recordings by entering the channel number and start and stop times like on a VCR , unless you compensate for the difference between the DVR 's clock time and your actual time . When these DVRs appeared , TVGOS was carried on analog TV broadcasts , which caused much uncertainty and anxiety over what would happen when analog broadcast TV shut down , which finally happened on June 12 , 2009 . -LRB- Many analog TVGOS host stations actually shut down or turned off TVGOS before then , including mine . -RRB- The good news is that Rovi\/Macrovision created a version of TVGOS that is piggybacked onto digital TV broadcasts , and the Sony DVRs can receive and use digital TVGOS , at least under good conditions . Cable TV companies can pass digital TVGOS through to their customers . They can also extract the TVGOS data from a digital channel and insert it into one of their analog channels . Sony has released an update to its software -LRB- version 1.2.21 -RRB- which makes it easier for these DVRs to latch onto a digital TVGOS host channel . You can download it from Sony 's web site and install it easily via a USB flash drive . The actual results so far seem to vary in different locations . Some people ca n't get digital TVGOS at all . Either it 's simply not available in their area , or the host station 's signal is too weak or unreliable . Some people can get the clock set properly , which enables them to schedule recordings manually , but they ca n't get a channel list . If you do have a channel list , you can almost certainly get daily updated program listings . This is probably the easiest part of digital TVGOS . After my analog TVGOS stopped , I was able to update the existing channel list on one of my DVRs with program listings from a digital TVGOS host station . However , I could not get a new channel list -LRB- on another DVR -RRB- for a couple of months . I finally managed to get a new channel list on that DVR , by using a Dish DTVPal converter box to convert a digital TVGOS host channel to analog , and temporarily feeding that into the DVR . After I got the channel list , I disconnected the converter box and was able to get updated program listings directly from the digital host channel . I 've seen reports from people who have used an Artec converter box for this . According to Rovi\/Macrovision , the DTVPal and the Artec are the only converter boxes that can do this . Later , after a nearby PBS -LRB- South Carolina ETV -RRB- station started to carry digital TVGOS , I was able to get a new channel list directly from that signal . This station 's signal is much stronger and more reliable than the one that I was previously using . I 've also gotten TVGOS up and running in two days after resetting one of my DVRs to factory default state and re-installing the new -LRB- 1.2.21 -RRB- software . If you 're considering buying one of these devices , I strongly recommend that you find out as much as you can beforehand , about the TVGOS situation in your area . If you can find someone in your area who uses one of these devices successfully , that 's a very good sign . If you can find someone in your area who uses some other TVGOS device successfully , that 's also a good sign . I have two of these DVRs , a 250 and a 500 , purchased in late 2005 and early 2006 . I use them for OTA broadcasts only , and have been very happy with them . TVGOS worked well for me during the analog era , and now that I have a good digital host station , it works well for me in the digital era . Besides the uncertainty during the analog to digital transition , the only problems I 've had with either DVR have been occasional freezes while fast-forwarding or rewinding a recording -LRB- which I think happens more often when I 'm simultaneously recording another program -RRB- , and a few errors in channel-number assignments in TVGOS -LRB- which can be corrected in the `` channel editor . '' -RRB- . Also , the digital -LRB- ATSC -RRB- tuner is n't as good as in recent TVs and the standard-definition digital-to-analog converter boxes . It does n't hold onto very weak signals or handle multipath interference as well as those newer devices do . My rating is based on my own experience , but other people 's experience may be very different . These are definitely not `` plug and play '' devices . You need to be prepared for difficulties in getting TVGOS working . Even without such difficulties , these are complex devices and it will take a while -LRB- and a lot of reading the manual -RRB- to become familiar with all their features . A Google search on the model numbers will lead you to a couple of active online forums where owners of these DVRs help each other out . 	Video Recorder
Probably the best way to capture Xbox 360 and PS3 video , but I 'm still hoping for HDMI capture some day . Frame rates have always been the problem , and remain so . Yes , you can capture at 1080p , but frame rate is only 30 . I bought this primarily for Forza 4 , which runs at 60 fps . I can capture at 720p , which gives me the 60 fps , but the included software only creates 30 fps video files . It 's very easy to use , and most games will probably look great , and the Forza stuff I create is pretty good , but does n't quite capture the smoothness `` in game '' . For the record , this captures anything from your console , not just games , so capturing home movies from DVD or making video files from Netflix or whatever , works well also . Good product . I 'm happy . STILL WANT 1080P AT 60 FRAMES !!! 	Video Recorder
I originally bought the ReplayTV because of the composite outputs and supposedly better picture . What a mess . First , I have regular cable -LRB- no other cable boxes -RRB- and it has problems tuning . I 'll either get a blue screen saying that I do n't subscribe to the channel , or I will get a fuzzy version of C-SPAN . If I change the channel a few times it will eventually tune in correctly . My cable is perfectly fine and the tuner on my TV does n't have any problems . This tuning problem also happens when it records , so when I want to record a show there is about a 25 % chance that it will record C-SPAN instead . On top of that , about every other night the box will hang when it dials up to the server . The only way to get the box working again is to unplug it and plug it back in . Any shows that you wanted to record while it was `` hung '' are not recorded . This thing should have a reset button on the front of it , I need to unplug it so often . <p> I 've emailed their tech support and can not get anything but automated canned responses . If they work the kinks out this would be great , but right now all of the problems I 'm having are n't worth the features . Buy with caution , and keep track of your 30 day return window .

I love the TiVo . It is awesome . I was n't aware that it only works for a few days , and then it says you must subscribe to the TiVo service -LRB- monthly fee -RRB- to keep using it . Also , if you buy something with a mail in rebate , you have to print that rebate form off right then or you will never get your rebate . You ca n't go back and print it later . I thought that a form would come in the mail , but it did n't . They say you can go back to a rebate page on amazon and put your purchase number in to get your rebate , but that did not work . I got screwed out of my rebate . I will probably never buy anything from amazon again that has a mail in rebate . 	Video Recorder
I purchased this player almost a month ago and I could not have made a better choice . I work in a electronics store and had the option of buying virtually any player on the market but I like the fact that the screen is very large as a ratio of the player size and it 's compact flash media , while not being as enermous as a 60Gb hard drive is very inexpensive and readily available . I purchased two 2Gb cards to supplement the included 512mb card that the X2400 comes with although I 'll probably buy more since I 'm finding more and more movies that I 'd like to carry around with me . As a media player the x2400 has a large easy to read display and a thoughtfully designed menu system . MP3 files , JPEGS and AVI files are all accessed through the `` library '' file and can be paused , rewound or fast forwarded through . The voice recorder with built in mic and some of the other more fluff functions I have yet to use but the quality of audio and video is excellent either through the built in speaker or through my headphones . It is video recording though that really shows the x2400 off to full advantage . The SUPPLIED AV cables can be attached to a TV , camcorder , digital camera or dvd player and record any amount of programing up to the limit of your media card in real time . Most of my Dvd collection is encrypted and so DVD ripping software like Nero just sits and spins but with the x2400 I can record the DVD 's into MP4s and watch them on the go . I did pay for them after all and I am glad to get the chance to actually veiw them somewhere other than my living room . Pros : Light weight but sturdy construction , big , bright screen , good quality audio and video , awesome recording capabilities and cheap readily available media . Cons : Batteries are replaceable but not yet available for purchase from RCA , screen and case are highly attractive to fingerprints and smudges , battery life is great on audio but video will take a battery from full to dead in 6 hours . Battery is supposed to charge from USB but mine does not All in all this little guy is a fantastic sleeper product , seemingly overlooked in favor of higher capacity hard drive based players and the cheaper non-expandible flash units . This product is brand new as of the time that I write this review so only time will tell wether it will catch on and get the notice that it deserves . 	Video Recorder
The tuner on this box is terrific . It changes channels quickly , has never locked up -LRB- unlike the Samsung SIRT-165 -RRB- , and has a good remote that lets you quickly pull up the channel info or signal strength . All of my local stations also broadcast in DTV , so I do n't miss the lack of an NTSC tuner . The antenna pass through allows me to connect my analog VCR as well -LRB- useful to have a second tuner for PIP -RRB- . <p> When considering whether or not I wanted to spring for the extra dollars to get a PVR or just a plain tuner , I had n't realized the difference HD recording would make . I really do n't want to watch TV shows any other way ! And for sharing purposes , you can always edit out the commericals of your recorded program and copy it to an analog VCR . <p> The timeshifting feature is pretty cool . Unfortunately , you ca n't rewind material you 've currently started recording through the timer . You have to start out using the timeshifting . The manual was a little unclear how it works exactly , so I 've managed to lose 1\/2 hour of a show while trying to figure it out . Suffice it to say that if you want to save timeshifted material -LRB- beyond the show 's duration -RRB- , you need to use the clip record function as well . Once you get used to timeshifting , you 'll love it . Friends calling in the middle of your favorite show are n't a nuisance any longer . <p> The only feature I really miss is the ability to seek to a particular time . Instead you have to fast forward at 50x speed -LRB- unless you 've bookmarked it -RRB- to the spot you want . You also ca n't delete the multi-channels . For example , say you only want channel 4-1 , but not 4-2 , you ca n't delete 4-2 . There is a surf button that moves the channel changer between channel numbers -LRB- and then you can use the ch + \/ ch - to move between the multi-stations -RRB- . Also be careful about your how you set the clock . I was using `` automatic '' and failed to record a few shows . I wonder if the machine received an errant signal and it triggered some of the reservations early . Once the clock was set , I had to switch it to manual set to get consistent results .

Where oh where would I be without this item . This is the greatest gift for anyone with children . I have a 4 year old that must know exactly when my favorite show is on and he must have my attention right then and there . Pause , record , rewind , skip commercials ; It has it all . The only thing that could make this better is if it did n't record the commercials at all . I would recommend this to everyone !! The downside is the help hot line . Your guess is as good as theirs , probably better . 	Video Recorder
What is are these bozos thinking . <p> They dropped the price from around $ 500 to $ 150 and then told people that the service was free . <p> It took ReplayTV a full week to let retailers know that SERVICE IS NOT INCLUDED for this price . <p> Now they are blaming Amazon and and other retailers saying that `` Unfortunately , certain retailers may not have taken the appropriate steps to change the pricing model resulting in potential confusion for customers . '' This is not Amazon or other retailers fault . <p> This is a company whos product was not selling and took desperate measures to sell their devise . Hoping that if recieved it as a gift , they might just say `` oh well and pay the price . '' <p> Replay 's previous company went bankrupt because they had no idea how to run a business . I hope this one does too . <p> If you gave this item as a gift ... hope you gave the reciept . <p> It is quite obvious that TiVo is better , but if the service fee was free , I was willing to give it a look . I am off to return my replay unit and get a TiVo from Amazon . 	Video Recorder
I just purchased a Tivo Series2 80hr and overall I 'm pretty happy about this product . The things I like about the unit are the ease of use -LRB- a very intuitive interface -RRB- and just the general concept of being able to watch many programs , that I otherwise would miss , any time I want . Two issues that should concern potential buyers , that I have found so far , are as follows ... If you use a digital cable box with your DVR you can not watch live TV and record at the same time . I remedied this by using a dedicated cable box for the Tivo and I have a secondary box for watching live TV . My TV supports multiple inputs so this was not a big deal other than the fact that you need a second cable box for this setup . Secondly , the 80hr record time advertised for this unit is at the `` basic '' quality setting , which is pretty lousy . Ideally you want to use the `` high '' quality setting which gives around 35 hrs record time . There is a `` best '' quality which gives around 22 hrs . So , now I 'm looking to upgrade the hard drive to a 200 GB unit which should give me 80 hrs plus at high quality which should be adequate . My suggestion , buy the 40hr unit and upgrade the hard drive immediately . I bought a factory refurb 80 hr model for $ 199 but should of got the factory refurb 40hr for $ 149 and saved $ 50 , which could of then gone to the new hard drive . Other than these two issues , I really like this product and would recommend it highly . 	Video Recorder
I ordered an original `` green '' stackable card -LRB- has worked fine for ~ 3 years -RRB- as portrayed in the advertising link -LRB- http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Q-See-QSPDVR04-Channel-Digital-Recorder\/dp\/B00069ECUY\/ref=sr_1_26?ie=UTF8&qid=1340278030&sr=8-26&keywords=dvr+pci+card -RRB- as a simple incremental addition to an existing system . I received the `` blue '' card which is not compatible with the `` green '' card due to different compression technology . The order processing was Amazon.com fine as always . A + security filled the order promptly . The problem is the emphasis of the `` green '' card in the posting with a minor reference that the `` blue '' card is not compatible . At my cost , I am returning the `` blue '' card to A + which suggested that I purchase an 8-channel card -LRB- requiring additional hardware modifications to the existing PC-based system -RRB- . Since I did not open the packaging and test the card , I can not rate it but have to to complete the form , so 3 stars for order processing . 	Video Recorder
I bought a Hauppauge WinTV-HVR-1600 last year . It works , but very poorly . Using an indoor HD antenna I can pick up only three local HD stations . The high definition picture is decent , but nowhere as good as on a HD television . I would like to point out that I am using a high-definition Samsung monitor with my computer . Meanwhile , analog stations , coming in through cable , are much , much worse . The picture is fuzzy , expecially when watching in full-screen mode . But my main gripe is that I ca n't pick up any digital stations through my cable provider , Comcast . The Hauppauge card with its QAM ability is supposed to let you do this . But I pick up zero digital stations through this card . However , I have a Toshiba HD television and it picks up many digital stations from my cable . A year ago I wrote to Hauppauge to complain about this and I received a reply saying , `` Our engineers are aware of this problem with Comcast and are working on it . '' Well , a year later I wrote to them asking for an update , and other than an initial e-mail asking me what software I was using , I have not received another response from Hauppauge support , even though I have written them many times . It is clear to me that they do not want to take any responsibility for their defective product . I will never buy a Hauppauge product again . 	Video Recorder
I have now had this for a year . I put a DVD in the first day that had a deep scratch and the whole unit seized . I agree with the customer service problems : Tivo says call Toshiba , Toshiba says call Tivo . However , within a few days I had a prepaid label to ship the unit back to Toshiba who replaced it immediately -LRB- and returned the DVD that was stuck -RRB- . That unit has been perfect . Absolutely no complaints other than everything happens a bit slow due to the delay in signal to the cable box . 	Video Recorder
My first experience with this kind of recorder was the built-in one with my Dish player . I was hooked . I moved and could n't have dish here so went to look at TIVO and REPLAY . Ultimately , the best system would be a combonation of the best of both , but alas ... My best friend has Replay and there are some great things -- but TIVO , by and far , is much better for me . I realize many smart people will see it different . <p> The Season Pass , Wishlists are just better . Plus , I DO NOT advise buying the Sony unit -- the remote is STUPID -- Philips rocks -- and it 's European and NOT Japanese ! 	Video Recorder
I have had my Replay TV 5508 -LRB- RTV -RRB- for one year and I have not been disappointed . Scheduling shows , pause , play , rewind those are features that all DVRs have . The RTV stands out among the pack by offering more features for the same price or less . Optical audio - I plug in one audio cable into my surround sound system and have instant 5.1 Surround Sound . Ethernet port - I have a small home network and a broadband connection . I can choose to give my RTV a static IP or DHCP . My RTV is pingable over the network and I can even download shows to my PC and edit them if I want . I can also save shows to my PC and view them over the network . Oh yeah ... and for the really geeky peeps like me ... I added my RTV to my SMNPC monitoring software . 30 second skip - This feature alone is enough for me to buy this product over the others . One tap of the button and I have skipped the latest ABC\/NFL towel dropping skank commercial with some desperate actress pimping her `` hit '' show . A rich community - Programs like DVarchive and www.planetreplay.com gives me access to the latest tips and tricks . There are groups of people out there that will let you download a show from them if you forget to tell RTV that you wanted to watch it . I also like the fact that RTV records what I want to watch and the genre functions are turned off until \* I \* turn them on . I never lose a show because RTV THINKS I might want to watch something I do n't . \*\* Edit 12-17-04 I forgot to mention a couple of more things . The 7 second rewind button - If you happen to skip to far into your show using the 30 second skip button , you can hit the 7 Second rewind button and it will usually take you back to exactly where the commercials end and the show begins . Veiw your photos on your TV - If have a home network and digital photos this is a great feature . You can use your RTV as a photo viewer and show the family photos over the TV instead of everyone crowding around your monitor . They also give you the option of making your photos your sceensaver -LRB- did I mention that RTV goes into screensaver mode when it 's left on pause to long ? -RRB- . What fan noise ?? If you can hear the fan , you have a problem with your RTV or your head . 	Video Recorder
As a first time Tivo buyer , and as I have never seen it in real life before , I was a little bit afraid . Would it really work ? Would I like it ? But then , after I set it up , which is very simple and menu driven -LRB- I wonder why they included two manuals -RRB- , my life of TV watching completely changed . I no longer need to waste my time to check TV programs , since Tivo does it for me . I no longer need to walk around the video stores to look for some movies -LRB- what a waste of time -RRB- . I can <p> finish David Letterman 's show in 15 minutes -LRB- and I do n't need to wait in fron ot TV on time and be there for an hour -RRB- . I have had for 3 weeks and so far , it works perfect as advertised -LRB- and more than I imagined -RRB- . <p> Even though it is advertised as 40 hour , I set it up as High Quality recording which gives only 18 hours or so . Normally this is really good enough . But when I watched French Open Tennis , if things are moving so fast on all over the screen , picture becomes blocky . If I use `` Best Quality '' recording which gives about 12 hours of recording , there is no such problem . <p> Only if I can record two channels at the same time ... It is a littel bit annoying when there are so many times I wanted to record two channels at the same time but I ca n't because there is a slight overlap - for example , if a program A ends at 3:15 and another starts at 3:00 , I ca n't record both of them at the same time . I have to manually set up one of them -LRB- and will lose 15 minutes -RRB- . This is understandable with the current techonolgy . Tivo is essentially a Linux computer server dedicated to compressing \/ decompressing videos . To perform two video compressions at the same time -LRB- and possibly uncompressing at the same time since the user may want to watch previously recorded one while recording two channels -RRB- would require some CPU power which prohibits the low cost , low heat and reliability . But I expect that within a few years this will be realized . Thanks Tivo ! ^ ^ 	Video Recorder
this is the best thing that i have bought in the last ten years . nomore missing shows because its on at a different time than normal , season pass keeps track of when they come on . i love the wishlist where you can just enter keywords like `` robin williams '' and tivo will record any show or movie with him in it . i have recomened tivo to 4 of my friends and each is as happy withit as i am . get it get it get it !

I ordered and received my 30 hour TIVO from Amazon.com last week . I have a home theater system , with all components -LRB- CD , DVD , Phono , Digital Cable Box , & VCR -RRB- connected through a Yamaha top-of-the-line A\/V receiver . As none of the example set-ups in the TIVO manual remotely matched mine , and despite the fact that normally I 'm pretty good at this type of thing , after about three hours of complete failure , I was positively stumped . I finally had to call TIVO 's customer care support . And this is where I am SO very impressed ! I was absolutely blown away when the TIVO representative stayed ON the phone for over an hour with me as I crawled behind my entertainment center with a flashlight and my cordless phone , with various cables in my teeth ! ; - -RRB- She walked me through every step and with persistence and effort on both our parts , finally we got everything hooked up and `` talking to '' each other . I 've never experienced customer service like this before on anything I 've ever bought . Amazing ! And as for the TIVO and how it is working now - great and I love it ! Only thing I did n't like was the fact TIVO\/Philips have truly overlooked the customer 's with home entertainment systems , calling a set up like mine , `` advanced '' - from what I can tell more and more consumers are going to the `` advanced '' systems so it would be good to see TIVO include hookup examples for `` advanced '' systems in their future product manuals .

I agree with the positive comments about how TIVO allows you to see the programs that you want to see . However , I want to warn those who do not have a great deal of familiarity with electronic items of the difficulties I have had . I have been unable to find a service that is familiar with TIVO . Most TV repair and satellite experts are not familiar with TIVO and therefore they are not very much help in integrating its operation with DIRECTV . As I am not adept on electronic matters , I have been frustrated with the difficulty of getting it work as it should . I have placed it back in its box until I find someone who has one and knows how to install it . Jane 	Video Recorder
I have owned Tivo for over 3 years and I love it !!! I work really early hours so I do n't get to watch prime time tv live . Tivo takes care of this ... It records my shows and then I watch them when I want to ... I even fast forward thru the commercials . Now keep in mind that you ca n't forward commercials in live tv , since no product has been invented to see the future -LRB- yet -RRB- ... As far as the hookup goes , if you can hook up a vcr , you can hook up tivo . Co-ax cable in , then co-ax cable out to tv\/vcr , you can even use RCA cables and SVideo too ... Only difference between Tivo and a VCR is that there are no video tapes to use , unless you want to transfer something to tape ... This is a great product and I am thinking of buying a second one ... Keep in mind that a subscription to the Tivo service is needed -LRB- monthly or a lifetime purchase is available -RRB- ... 	Video Recorder

I never had a DVR -LRB- aside from my computer -RRB- before , so when I finally managed to get my Tivo all hooked up , I was really impressed . I especially love the `` Season Pass '' feature which will pick out all the times your favorites program airs , and let you schedule recording for all of them in a few clicks . But then the headaches began ... -LRB- 1 . -RRB- First of all , how many of us have the telephone line near our TVs ? Normally , the TV and electronic gadgets are on one side of the room , and the phone is on the other - right ? Tivo needs a phone line to get it 's program information - at least initially . So if your house is configured like mine , be prepared to have phone line extensions strewn all across your living room while you spend up to a day downloading and installing all the program information by phone . So of course , I almost began to drool when I read in the Manual that you can actually connect the Tivo to your local or wireless network . -LRB- 2 . -RRB- Problem is , you most likely will NOT be able to connect your Tivo to your local or wireless network . I took Tivo 's own approved list of hardware -LRB- direct network adapters or wireless receivers -RRB- to my local geek toy store , and bought the top recommended networking connection on the list . That did n't work , so I returned it and bought the next recommended item on Tivo 's list . That did n't work either , so over the course of the next two weeks I tried three -LRB- yes , 3 -RRB- more . Nothing . I finally gave up , and had to buy a long extension cord for my phone line and install it more perminent-like . -LRB- 3 . -RRB- The main reason I 'm here today , is because I found this page while searching for an explanation to the weird high pitched whistle noise my Tivo began making last night -LRB- after only 2 months of ownership -RRB- . Turns out this is apparently an increasingly common problem - which I never heard of until today - and even more unfortunately seems to indicate that my Tivo will be totally dead in the next few days . Right now , it 's literally delaying everything I do -LRB- trying to view my cable box 's program guide , etc -RRB- by 30 seconds or more -LRB- the normal lag time should be around 1 or 2 seconds -RRB- So , since I 've already paid for the lifetime membership , I 'm now searching for a relatively cheap way I can fix the problem myself . Do I need to replace the harddrive , the case fans , . . or what ? By the way , if Tivo goes out of business , how will I get my program guide ? Tivo does n't grab the FREE TV Guide data from your cable like the no-subscription-required Panasonics can . -LRB- 4 . -RRB- Oh , and also wanted to warn people about one more thing that only starts happening after you 've had your Tivo for a few weeks - which is actually intentional on the part of Tivo - but which is n't mentioned anywhere in any of their manuals or documentation , for obvious reasons ... After a few weeks -LRB- if your Tivo still works -RRB- , you 'll start to get little on-screen pop-up alerts RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE OF YOUR FAVORITE PROGRAM which stay there for atleast 30 seconds until you click it or patiently wait for it to go away . And what are these prompts ? ADVERTISING which actually is made to look like a really important subscriber announcement from Tivo . Maybe it 's important to THEM , but I 'd rather NOT see it in the middle of my TV screen . Actually , that 's yet another example of Tivo 's dumb implimentation : You 'll only see this advertising if you 're watching live TV instead of the recorded programming ... and since most people with Tivos are watching the recorded programs instead of live TV , Tivo 's sponsors are paying for ads that few people will ever see ... Great business ideas - yes ? -RRB- In addition to these on-screen ads which interrupt your viewing , when you go to your Tivo menu , you 'll find atleast TWO links to advertisements . The really bad thing about these links in particular is that they are positioned in the place where your other normal Tivo menu options are listed . So instead of selecting your `` To Do List '' or upcoming recordings , you might accidently find yourself watching a series of advertisements - WHICH YOU CAN NOT DELETE OR REMOVE . OK , so that 's all I have to say at this point . Seems to me that Tivo had a great idea , but terrible implimentation . I do n't know about their customer service , but I probably also wo n't even bother , if it 's going to cost me $ 100 to $ 150 to ship them back their own defective product anyway . If I ca n't fix the Tivo , and I 'm not in the mood to pay double-or-triple in trying to get it fixed , then it 's apparently just become one nice looking but useless paperweight ... to which I have a lifetime subscription .

This does everything you could ask for and more . It has more features than TiVo -LRB- such as skipping commericals with the push of one button , or skipping to the third segment of a newsmagazine -RRB- and is cheaper . 	Video Recorder
I was an early adopter of Tivo . I have a 30 hour by Philips , and an 80 hour by Tivo . I love my Tivos ... and I hate them . In short , the software is great , the hardware is awful . <p> My first 30 hour , I got from Amazon . It died within a few days , and Amazon rapidly sent me another one -LRB- thanks , Amazon ! -RRB- . That one died within a month , and Tivo sent me another one . When that one died a few months later , I had to pay a substantial amount of money to get a refurbished unit from Tivo . That one 's still alive , knock wood . I did figure out after the first one died that the Tivo can not be put into a component cabinet - it overheats . <p> Undeterred , I got the Series 2 80 hour . This time , I went to a local retailer , anticipating problems . 9 months later , I 'm still on my first unit , BUT ... <p> In February , the fan became noisy -LRB- like jet-about-to-take-off noisy -RRB- , so I took it in for repairs . A month or so later , I got it back . It was DOA !!! How do they fix a fan , and kill the thing , without noticing ? I took it back the next day . A month or so later -LRB- yesterday -RRB- , got it back again . STILL DOA !!!! My retailer is in the process of asking Tivo to swap it out for another unit . <p> I 'm astonished at Tivo 's repeated display of incompetence and its flagrant disregard for quality control . Ca n't they even plug the thing in and see if the little light and fan come on before they ship it back to the customer ?? <p> I 'm done spending money on Tivo . I have heard that my cable company is coming out with its own PVR product . Ca n't happen soon enough for me . 	Video Recorder
NOTICE : This review relates to TiVo , not this specific hardware device . I have a Sony SAT-T60 DirecTV\/TiVo combination receiver . My wife and I became addicted to TiVo within 1 month after installing it . We have gone from watching 90 % live TV\/10 % recorded -LRB- VCR -RRB- to 90 % Tivo\/10 % live TV ! We hardly watch anything anymore at its regular time . We simply pull up the `` Now Playing '' menu , which lists all the shows I have previously recorded , and watch whatever we 're in the mood for - drama -LRB- Law and Order or Once and Again -RRB- , comedy -LRB- Friends , South Park -RRB- , reality TV -LRB- Survivor , Fear Factor -RRB- , or sports -LRB- Illinois basketball , cliff diving -RRB- . <p> There are so many cool things about TiVo , but these are my THREE FAVORITE things : 1 -RRB- Season Pass , which once you set it up , allows you to record a particular show EVERY time it 's on or all shows with a particular actor or subject , 2 -RRB- Easy to record -LRB- simply choose the show , not the time and channel -RRB- and easy to find and play -LRB- scroll through `` Now Playing '' list of prerecorded shows and choose `` Select '' to play -RRB- , 3 -RRB- Record two shows at once -LRB- like Survivor and Friends , which both start at 8:00 on Thursday -RRB- with a DirecTV\/TiVo combination receiver , which we have . <p> We started with the monthly subscription and moved to the lifetime after just a month -LRB- it 's good for the life of the box , not you -RRB- . We have a Sony model , and I 've found Sony to always be reliable -LRB- two TVs , one VCR -RRB- . I bought a 4-year warranty as a safety precaution -LRB- new technology and insurance against the lifetime subscription -RRB- . DirecTV customer service is decent , but not great -LRB- they handle the TiVo side as well -RRB- . The BEST resource for TiVo is the TiVo AVS forum , which you can link to from the Buzz section of the TiVo Web site . It 's a `` must read '' prior to buying this unit . But I am not exaggerating when I say that this is the coolest , most liberating invention to come out since the World Wide Web . No joke ! You will fall in love with your TiVo too . 	Video Recorder
We were quite excited to receive our Tivo , but it was n't until AFTER we 'd paid the `` lifetime fee '' on the machine that we discovered a MAJOR problem . Apparently , our DirecTv box does not have a serial cable connection so we had to use the Infrared -LRB- IR -RRB- set up -LRB- basically two little prongs that stick out in front of the IR window on the DirecTv box to `` beam '' the signal -- as opposed to it going directly through a serial cable connection between the two machines -RRB- . We have roughly a 70 % margin of error -LRB- i.e. , FAILURE RATE -RRB- in changing the channel . We 've used every troubleshooting tip suggested by Tivo , but none have improved the situation -LRB- including one that involves building a cardboard `` tent '' around the prongs -- simply lovely for interior decorating . When we received this gift -LRB- through Amazon -RRB- , the combined DirecTv\/Tivo machine was not available so we were not able to return the machine and `` upgrade '' -LRB- which we 'd considered doing before we actually gave in and paid the $ 300 `` lifetime of the machine '' fee -RRB- . If you have DirecTV , DO NOT BUY THIS MACHINE unless you are SURE that you have the ability to connect via serial cable . We look forward to one day seeing what is supposed to be so `` great '' about Tivo , but for now we are left wanting to go `` Office Space '' on our machine . Hope you have better luck !

I installed the Hauppauge 1178 WinTV-HVR-1600 Internal Hybrid TV Tuner\/Video Recorder in my Windows 64 bit Vista machine and it only works PART OF THE TIME . It works fine at times , but other times the signal is broken up and lots of pieces come up missing . I 've tried EVERYTHING TO FIX the problem only to wind up in defeat . I wish I had gone another route . In all fairness , the company did offer to refund my money -LRB- or exchange it whatever -RRB- but I kept it and tried some more tricks , only to wind up again with the same mess from time to time . Oh well , live and learn . Works great WHEN IT WORKS . 	Video Recorder
the recorder works great , there 's nothing wrong with it , very convenient to use , battery life is long -LRB- have not replaced for 6 weeks and still going strong -RRB- sound quality is not bad -LRB- much better in comparison to the ones you might want to use if you 're using it for singing , but for lecture purposes , it works great -RRB- . reasonably priced . 	Voice Recorder
I did n't use the recorder much when I first bought it , it was for a speech class requirement . After a year or two I decided I was going to start using it to record meetings so that when I write the minutes , I 'll have the meeting to refer to . I upload the recordings on my computer no problem and then listen that way so I do n't run down the batteries on the recorder . For several months this worked fine , then every now and then one of my recordings would not be able to play on the computer so I would listen to it from the recorder . I went online and found a site that said to reformat the recorder , so I did that , it worked okay for a while then started doing the same thing . Today it 's different , I have 2 recordings that I need to transcribe , they do not show up when I look for them on the recorder however they do show up when I use the USB cord on the computer . One of the recordings I was able to convert and save to my computer , the other is corrupt so not only can I save it to my computer , I ca n't even find it to listen to it on the recorder , it 's totally useless !! Terrible cheap machine . 	Voice Recorder
The Olympus VN5000 is super easy to use , light weight and convenient . I did n't necessarily need to transfer my recordings to my computer , so this particular model worked out great . 	Voice Recorder
I got this portable voice recorder for under $ 50 and it works and sounds great . Perfect for recording class lectures , business meetings , phone conversations , interviews , etc. . . Sure you could probably record all that on your smart phones , but if you are looking for a dedicated device that is easy to use this Olympus model has been pretty great for me so far .

"</div> <spanclass=""tiny""> Length : : 4:51 Mins </span> This is my youtube review of the Olympus WS700 . And yes , I eventually did return it and got the Zoom H1 . It suits me better . P.S. . The thing I was referring to in the video that I did n't like was `` Low Cut Filter '' . "	Voice Recorder
The worse technical aspect of this device is that it only records in wma -LRB- or Windows Media Audio format -RRB- . MP3 is the standard and users should have that option even if the manufacturer prefers another format . It also suffers from a reliability problem as well . We enjoyed the ease of use so much that we bought about 5 of them for our reporters , various WS3xx models . While they functioned well for about a year , all of them after about a year started having issues with corrupting audio files . We tried lots of things to fix them , reformatting , etc. but the problems persisted . It would record fine , but then you could n't transfer the file off of the device , nor could you play it back completely . After losing a couple of irreplaceable interviews , we finally had to purchase another brand . Of course none of them are covered under warranty , so this seems like typical planned failure by manufacturers , which is why I ca n't recommend this device to anyone who cares about a device that has longevity and security of your audio files in mind . I suggest purchasing another brand , although be careful with Sony , as some of their products require you to install software to access the audio , and the software is only compatible with certain operating systems , not mac-friendly , nor 64-bit friendly . We now use the Zoom H4n , which blows them all away in every way , except its price and size . But you get what you pay for . Good luck . 	Voice Recorder
I use this digital recorder as a remote microphone for video work . There is no RF interference from other equipment , no wires , it 's compact , no transmitter\/receiver batteries to worry about and the digital files insert and correspond exactly to the video timeline on my video editing software . The unit slips into a pocket of the speaker , but the optional accessory microphone -LRB- Olympus ME52W -RRB- works as a lapel mike with the recorder hidden in the clothing . Do n't expect music-quality stereo , but for voice narration or interviews , it is just fine . 	Voice Recorder
My problem with this recorder or any other voice recorder is that I could n't remember how to perform some of the functions , and what buttons I am supposed to push to move files , etc. . But there is now a video manual showing all the functions -LRB- broken into chapters -RRB- for Olympus 4100PC on www.HandBookLive.com under Electronics . I tried a similar Panasonic model but could n't figure out the written manual , so I managed to password protect myself and not being able to reset it -LRB- ended up returning it back to Fry 's -RRB- . We made a HandBookLive video on Olympus 4100PC recorder so that others would n't struggle . Hope this helps ! 	Voice Recorder
THIS PRODUCT WORKS GREAT FOR RECORDING ONLY . THERE IS NO WAY TO DOWNLOAD IN RECORDINGS . IT WILL STAY IN THE RECORDER FOREVER , BECOUSE I HAVE NO WAY TO DOWNLOAD IT . 	Voice Recorder
I love this recorder ! It picks up distant voices clearly with little background noise . 	Voice Recorder
They sent me the wrong item , and rather dismissive about my complaint . I sent a complaint letter to Amazon.com about weeks ago , have n't heard anything from it yet . Very bad purchase experience . 	Voice Recorder
I use this device for recording phone interviews -LRB- I 'm a writer -RRB- and it 's great ! Had it for several years now and rarely had a problem -LRB- the only problems I 've ever had were due to a bad phone connection , which resulted in a static-y sounding interview -RRB- and the battery running out mid-interview - neither of which was the device 's fault . 	Voice Recorder
This recorder is very easy and convenient to use . It has many features and settings that I did not adjust , so I can only comment on the basics , but it suits my needs very well . One word of caution - the battery that comes with it may not be fully charged when you open the box , so be sure you re-charge it before use . There is a lot of information on that tiny screen , so it can be hard to tell how much juice is left in the battery . 	Voice Recorder
DOES work on Macs ! I have Mac OSX Snow Leopard . I did n't have to download any software\/converter to play on my Mac . All I did was set the recorder format to HQ -LRB- . WAV -RRB- file . Once I plugged it into my Mac the disk containing A\/B\/C \/ D folders popped up . I double clicked on folder A -LRB- where my could file was saved -RRB- . I opened the . WAV file by right clicking-open with itunes . It works ! Hope this helps : - -RRB- Also this is REALLy helpful . I did not receive a manual with mine -LRB- it was used -RRB- so you can download it here : -LRB- ... -RRB- 	Voice Recorder
This voice recorder is easy to use . All the recordings can be traced by dates instead of folders system which makes it such practical gadget . Also , this date system can be subdivided and the user can have several recordings in one date . If it is not in use , it turns itself off . When it is necessary to turn on , just press the REC button and ready to use . 	Voice Recorder
I searched for products that were compatible with the Mac and this came up . Good brand name , great price ... but boy was I disappointed . I ca n't dump my files unto my machine unless I 'm using windows . This is a big let down for me as I am a MacAddict . 	Voice Recorder
I purchased this Digital Voice Recorder to record EVP while ghost hunting . While I have yet to record an EVP -LRB- having just got the product today -RRB- I must say I am very impressed with the ease of use and sound quality of this unit . The large display is easy to read and and controls pretty much self explanatory -- any of the menu features can be accessed by pressing and holding the menu buttion in the center of the controls . I 'll have to update this review if I actually capture an EVP -LRB- to let people know it works if they are getting it for the same use as I -RRB- . 	Voice Recorder
Just have it for 2 days and I am sad about one important thing : USB connection to PC . When I connected it to a pc , something installed , but it never stops flashing and always shows busy storage . I tried to use Windows Explorer to check the files , it may take 5 minutes to open the root folder , then I click on one folder , such as MUSIC , it will take another 5 minutes . I tried to use Task Manager to see what 's happening and found Windows Exploring stops response . As it never slops flashing , I have to directly disconnect it from my PC -LRB- no safely remove USB Mass Storage Device -RRB- . I tried again and again , never can allow me to check the content or copy files easily . I even restarted my computer . Similar thing happened with another PC . I checked the detailed instruction -LRB- found on Olympus 's web site -RRB- and could not found any help with this issue . Only on page 79 , they says that the operation may become unstable if using a USB hub . But I did not use a hub and the unit is directly connected with PC 's USB port . I could not give a higher rate as if I could not copy files in\/out to the unit easily , I need to think twice to use it . If OLYMPUS can instruct user with this issue , I may come back to modify my rate . Added 4.8.2012 : I only bought 803 and so far I think the recording and playing are very good . I really do not know what happened for the connection to my PCs . Finally , it works well with one computer -LRB- restarted few times and did a system clean up , but still not working with the other one -RRB- . I increased my rating and hope it is objective to it . 	Voice Recorder
I used this a few times and it works great , I was able to copy the recording to my pc and email or burn to a cd . 	Voice Recorder
I bought this primarily so that I could record my thoughts and then transcribe them to text using Dragon Naturally Speaking . Over the years , I 've used a number of different recorders with varying degrees of success . This is the only one that I now use consistently for the purpose of transcription . While the accuracy is not perfect , nothing is , I am extremely surprised at how good the sound quality is so that Dragon can create text with a high degree of accuracy . I 've always wanted a device that I could rely on for this purpose ; this is the first one to win my confidence . 	Voice Recorder
I bought the Olympus WS-110 WMA Digital Voice Recorder after researching quite a few brands and models -LRB- on Amazon and elsewhere -RRB- . As I 've used the device for about 3 hours only -LRB- since I got it yesterday -RRB- , my feedback here will probably be revised after a few days ' use . Pros : 1 . Ideal size - lightweight ; not heavy\/bulky like most microtape recorders 2 . Simple and intuitive user interface - the buttons are sized correctly and the on-screen prompts are useful 3 . Quality of recording at the highest quality is simply superb . I am still amazed at the high quality of audio . 4 . Connectivity to the PC is straightforward -LRB- through the USB port -RRB- and finding the file within the folder structure is effortless . 5 . The price I paid -LRB- $ 60 + free shipping -RRB- makes this device a fabulous buy . 6 . The in-built speaker is quite good considering its size Cons : 1 . File format is limited to WMA\/Windows Media instead of mp3 or a more Microsoft-independent format ; I knew about this limitation when I bought the device but figured I could live with this limitation . 2 . In-built mike is supersensitive -LRB- this is a disadvantage if the device is being used in an environment with substantial background noises -RRB- . For my purposes , the sensitivity is welcome as I am currently using the device in environments with minimal background noise . I do n't plan on buying a noise-cancelling mike as it might not be necessary . Overall - I would rate this voice recorder as a 4.5 \/ 5.0 . It loses 0.5 points for being too MicroSoft-specific -LRB- WMA -RRB- as opposed to using a non-proprietory format . Will edit this review -LRB- if possible -RRB- after using the device for a few more days . 	Voice Recorder
I bought this product to take to a lecture to record the presentation given by the speaker . The room was rather large -LRB- hotel conference auditorium -RRB- and the speaker 's voice was amplified through the hotel 's audio system . When I played-back the recording , I found that the speaker 's voice sounded distant , while the voice of the person sitting next to me was LOUD AND CLEAR . The recorder picked up sounds of people nearby shuffling papers , coughing , whispering to each other , as well as ME touching the recorder to move it around . The voice of the lecturer \* could \* be heard , but I had to strain to hear his voice . I am now looking for a different recorder before I attend my next lecture . If you are buying a recorder for THIS purpose , this is not the recorder you want . 	Voice Recorder
Great recorder for the casual user . I bought the Olympus WS-710M recorder to record class lectures and light singing in the car , nothing too intense . It works great as a lecture recorder , average as a musical recorder ... guess my vocals were a bit too loud for the small microphones , might need to attach an external one . I was n't expecting amazing quality , but the lectures really sound clear and amazing , not too mention the saved files are n't too big , even at max recording quality . Thumbs up ! Note : I felt I needed more space , so I bought a 32GB micro SD card -LRB- though the manual says 16GB max -RRB- . Stuck that sucker in and now have 40GB of space to record to my heart 's content . Awesome . 	Voice Recorder
I bought this recording device strictly because I could upload the files to a PC after I am done recording , and possibly burn CDs of those files . When I went to install the software on my PC , I received an error stating that the operating system was incompatible with the software , and I was not able to install the software for the recorder . I have Windows XP . How could this be ?? This is retarded !! I am currently making arrangements to return this . I 've never had problems installing other software in the past . I read other reviews of this product concerning the same problem that others were having installing the sofware , but I seriously did not think it would apply to me since I have XP , yet I was struck down also . If Sony is making it this hard to install their product , go somewhere else and buy a recorder from a different manufacturer . Dont buy this product , or buy at your own risk . It is not worth the aggrivation . One last note . Looking at the recorder itself , I 'm not completely satisfied with the ease of its use . It comes with a 54 page manual . And there is no `` off '' switch . It stays on all the time , and I get the impression that it is easy to record over previous messages , if you are not careful . 	Voice Recorder
Looks like you 're going to have to buy the higher model to get the accompanying software -LRB- CD -RRB- If someone else has purchased this , please tell me that the software is on the device somewhere . I purchased a higher grade olympus recorder and the CD was included . Not so with the WS400 . 	Voice Recorder
i am a hynotherapist . my digital recorder broke shortly before a scheduled client . i not only found the best price plus shipping to Hawaii with an Amazon seller for an upgraded version , but i was impressed with how quickly i received it and in excellent condition . i saved the client .

Excellent voice quality , easy to use , long battery life . . great price ! . . My sister proclaims herself a physic ! . . She used this device in my new place -LRB- I told her I sometimes felt something was here -RRB- . . She held my recorder & asked `` is there anyone here '' . . `` what is your name '' , ect ... We played it back . . A male voice responded `` yes '' '' my name is Richard '' . . '' I live here '' ... So . . this is a true story & it happened to pick up a spirits voice with perfect clarity too !! . . True story ... I would suggest this product ... it is great !! 	Voice Recorder
Just received the recorder two days ago . It was very easy to use . I did n't even read the manual and was able to figure everything out by playing with . A recorder is only valuable if the quality of sound captured is acceptable . From all the recordings i have made in the past two days only those when i am at home and completely quiet is when i get a semi-acceptable sound . While driving i stopped at red light and started recording a few lines , all the sound came back muffled and with echo . It is a terrible recorder regardless of the ease of use . Another negative aspect of this item is that you ca n't download your sound files to your computer . Buyer beware . Do n't fall for its looks !!! 	Voice Recorder
The package has not arrived yet . It is more than 2 weeks late . I 'm leaving the country soon and hope it arrives before I leave . 	Voice Recorder
I picked one of these up because the kids were watching that ghost adventure show and wanted to catch some EVP 's -LRB- scary -RRB- all in all a great device though highly recommend it for the dollar 	Voice Recorder
I 'm an actor and , when it comes to learning lines , I 've always done it with tape recorders : I record my cues , pause , then speak my line . This gives me a sense of pace for the scene and allows me to think faster and more precisely . After a few years of tape recorders , though , and an ever-shrinking apartment , I decided to go forgo actual tapes and enter the digital age . One of the best features about this voice recorder is its organizational tool : you can record lots of files into a single folder -LRB- one of four -RRB- allowing , in my instance , for scene breakdowns . Navigation is intuitive and moving from file to file -LRB- scene to scene -RRB- is a cinch . With digital , there 's no waiting to rewind or fast forward , and work has become very efficient . My only critique -LRB- which is why I gave it a 4-star rating , instead of a full 5 -RRB- is that , unlike most tape recorders , this device does n't have a STANDBY button . The PLAY and STOP buttons are two separate buttons requiring thumb movement to toggle between the two . This becomes a bit cumbersome when I 'm studying rapid dialogue or recording cues because I have to look at the device to see where to move my thumb to pause or to continue the recording . A single STANDBY button , to simply stop and start , would have been very useful . Aside from this small criticism , I have nothing negative to say . The sound quality is great , its efficient use of battery life is excellent and the size is very convenient . I highly recommend this product . 	Voice Recorder
I work as a Court Reporter and use this handy little recorder as a backup . It is especially handy when I have to move to chambers . I move my main unit and then throw this on the desk as a backup . It is compatible with my transcription software and I love it . I also use it to record church council meetings - as the secretary , I have to type up the minutes . The voice quality is excellent and it will pick up from an amazing distance for the size and without any external mic added to it . 	Voice Recorder
This is my first digital voice recorder ! When I showed my colleagues at the office my Olympus VN-8100PC Digital Voice Recorder 142600 , it set off a trend ! LOL After seeing and feeling how sleek it was , many of them wanted to upgrade their voice recorders ! LOL Triplenet Pricing LLC 's delivery was super fast ! 	Voice Recorder
After a few weeks of successful use , my WM 700 began to not boot up AND not shut off . The only way to turn it off was to remove the battery . Then it would start OK again , but soon stop allowing me to select Folders . When I changed battery types -LRB- NiMH to alkaline -RRB- I got a `` Please Wait '' message that took half an hour to resolve , meanwhile I 'm missing the lecture I needed to record . Even when it was working fine , I felt the operation was not intuitive , with too many operations depending on ONE button being used in the exact sequence ; if you missed this sequence , the whole thing got screwed up , and as mentioned above , often would not even turn off . I 'm having a hard time contacting Olympus warranty service , lots of run-arounds . I was v. happy to find this recorder , but after owning it and trying to use if for several months , am very disappointed with it . My next recorder will be a different brand and I 'll be reading the instruction manual -LRB- s -RRB- first to see if the operation steps makes natural sense . I bought Tasco stuff for years , had excellent tech support , but this is not true for Olympus . If someone can tell me how to contact Olympus tech support , please email me at ebuckler@q.com .

Excellent . I love it . Since heaven did not bless me with much of a memory for details , I could n't survive without a pocket recorder . I have tried several . My favorite was the VT-300 , but I think they are no longer made . My wife gave me this Olympus as an anniversary gift . It has been my constant companion . since . I wish it were a bit smaller , but that is not a big issue . It fits in my pants pocket just fine . Lots of recording space , good sound . 	Voice Recorder
This is an easy to use voice recorder , but if you 're looking for quality , go with an Olympus . The sound quality of the playback is horrible , both on the player itself and the computer . Hoever , if you need a recorder just for grocery lists or lectures , this will do . 	Voice Recorder
I have had this recorder for a while . For the most part the recorder works well and is easy to operate . However , there is an intermittent problem with this digital recorder where it is prone to picking up feedback or interference in the area . Because there 's no way to go back in many cases , this is very maddening . I am now looking for another recorder because this recorder can not be trusted . 	Voice Recorder
I love my sony voice recorder , it is simple to use , the sound quality is great and the battery life is awesome . Recommended ! 	Voice Recorder
I purchased my SX700 a couple of years ago for general audio recording . I carried it around in my professional backpack along with my laptop and other geek gear . I really like the quality of the recording , but the controls are not at all good . Also , my device started freezing and giving an error message this year . I could no longer record even though the unit is not damaged in any way and has been cared for quite well . I do n't abuse my toys . I 've just ordered the SX712 because it has better controls and a slot for a flash card . My SX700 has some audio on it that I 'd like to get off , but I ca n't remove the media and it is now nonfunctional so I am probably out of luck . I just received my SX712 and I have to agree with some reviewers of that product . The finish and materials on the SX700 are much nicer . The new product feels cheaper . But I do like the layout of the controls on the SX712 much better . Too bad they changed the materials and finish , the SX700 has a really nice feel . 	Voice Recorder
Small , easy to work and rugged . I have dropped my a few times and it still works . 	Voice Recorder
I use this recording device to record my voice\/piano lessons . For my purposes , and especially given the size of the device , the recording quality is fine . It 's also very easy to use and to transfer data to my computer . I really love its small size and light weight - these attributes make it especially easy for me to replay lessons as I 'm practicing , using the headphones that come with the device . 	Voice Recorder
I bought the 4GB version for my son , and one for me . He loved his to death -LRB- took it everywhere and managed to crack the face , which took some doing -RRB- so I gave him mine and bought myself an 8GB . The first one sent had a bad battery circuit ; I requested a replacement , they emailed me a return label and sent me the replacement as soon as I had mailed it . The replacement works perfectly . These are excellent quality players with tons of features and outstanding value for money , and the company 's customer service is friendly and helpful . I highly recommend this product and company . 	Voice Recorder
I use this recorder to record meetings so that I can take notes . The sound is excellent . There are two settings - high and low . However , the instructions too complicated and the buttons are not easy to use . I want `` record '' `` stop '' `` rewind '' and `` playback '' . Period . If you make a mistake and do not choose a `` file '' before recording -LRB- not easy to do -RRB- you will lose everything . 	Voice Recorder
nothing to say but what an awesome product , i have had few of Olympus Digital Recorder I love these ! I do not like a SONY recorder i was let down on due to the volume on BOTH of these recorder , go up to 30 but this one even on barely 10 to 15 it is LOUD after your recording as i do much with conversation , reporting , legal notes , study et . just records so perfectly , crystal clear . Sony product i turn it up to 10 to 30 and i can rarely hear it , and i have perfect hearing , as i am PERFECTLY happy with this great product , i bought one during 07 and another during again 2009-2010 great product for sure , so much recording time ... again amazon.com price just right . i am so happy with Olympus Product once again in 2010 . adios .

I bought this to help with interviews for my dissertation , and am on a very tight budget . I ended up flabbergasted by how little it does . It is impossible to download the interviews onto my computer , or save them on any other medium other than the device itself . In other words , I ca n't save my interviews . And , it 's confusing to use ! There is no volume dial , and it is absurdly tricky to adjust the volume of the playback . It recorded my trials very softly - not sure if it 's me or what - and then the `` erase '' button is easily triggered . It must have gotten bumped in my purse and erased everything . Total junk .

Not sure if you 've had the chance to use the VN-4100 which offers up to 144 hours of amazing recording time . Well I have and it was so good I purchased two . Now I 'm not telling you to go and do that but if you 're speaking as much as I am everyday you might want to consider it . This sleek body is well designed with everything you need right on the front ... Stop , record , erase , ffwd , rewind ... this baby does it all except think ... now that part is up to you . But if you want to be innovative give me a call and we will mix it up . As a matter of fact I 'm using this technology to aid me with the recording of my debut single . It 's reliable , durable with a wonderful smart technology that allows you to revoltionize how you transfer your recordings after you 've recorded . Most recorders wo n't allow you to do this but this one let 's you change the folders where you originally recorded stuff . I have found this to be one of the neatest features on the whole digital recording scene . So if you want to try this out order it and if you do n't you ca n't blame it on me . Is there anything I can do for you ? Your Servant , Deremiah , \* CPE 	Voice Recorder
I was also sent the wrong item . There are two versions of the VN-4100 : one is just a recorder with NO WAY to download files to a PC . The second version is the VN-4100PC which allows you to download your files to a computer . I received the non-PC version and now have to return the one they sent . I will have to argue for shipping charges to be reversed . 	Voice Recorder
I 've been using this recorder for a month and a half and I absolutely love it . It is easy to use and always gets the job done . The different folders are a great idea and it makes it easy to organize recordings . It is very easy getting the recordings off and works just like a flashdrive . The only issue that I had was that if you delete the files from the recorder without using the interface , it will think the data is still there and takes up space . The solution is just to always use the Erase function on the actual device . It is such a neat little device that I would recommend it to anyone that wants to record things without spending a lot of money . = D 	Voice Recorder
I am very excited to start using this device to record lectures in school . I chose this Olympus VN-8100PC because it is super user-friendly , and because according to the reviews , it is said to have great battery life . I am not too techie , so it is perfect . The directions included were very straightforward , helpful , and easy to understand , with pictures , so I am very pleased and impressed . So if you have tech-phobia or fine print instructions-phobia , be at ease . This product is for you . I noticed that the external mic is extremely sensitive , so a good setting to use is to turn on the `` low cut filter . '' It makes a big difference in eliminating fuzzy noise and increasing voice clarity while recording . Also , when listening to playback , enable `` voice filter . '' Thank you Amazon !! 	Voice Recorder
overall it is for the price but beware , when it says MP3 it means MP3 and not the newer format . so make sure everything is MP3 , WMA , or WAV only or it will not read it . besides from that little problem it has worked good . sound is nice and interface is easy . 	Voice Recorder
This recorder is very light , small enough to fit in your pocket or purse and easy to use . The sound quality is good and the software that comes with it is simple with a good help section if you want to do something more advanced . 	Voice Recorder
Looking over reviews of the Olympus WS-500 , I decided to upgrade from a WS-400S . The features are similar except for greater storage capacity and availability of music mode on the WS-500 . However , the voice quality and pick up range of the WS-500 I received is really inadequate compared to both the WS-400 I am using now and my older VN-4100 PC -LRB- which is less convenient but has the best sound quality -RRB- . The screen also has a more greenish-grey tint that is harder to see than the WS-400 . That 's irritating but even more important for me is this -- I can not use this recorder for interviews or even conference presentations . Whether on conference or dictation mode , the sound quality is just weak and barely audible . I am wondering is the recorder I received just defective or is the WS-500 geared more to playing music than recording in voice mode ? At this moment , I 'm wishing I saved myself time and money by listening to the more critical reviews here and just sticking to the WS-400 . 	Voice Recorder
I have n't used it too much , but so far , it is exactly what I was looking for , good price , pc compatible and downloadable files 	Voice Recorder
There is no interface such as USB to transfter the data to the computer . You have to listen to the voice on the recorder , which is very inconvient . 	Voice Recorder
I purchased the RCA VR5220 for two reason : it has USB connectivity and is SUPPOSED to be able to `` Playback audio files on PCs and Macs . '' The label on the box states the following on computer system requirements : `` Mac OSX version 10.4.11 or later -LRB- Voice Manager software is not available for Mac systems . To listen to audio files on your mac , simply copy the audio files to your mac and use Quicktime for listening . '' Since I use Audacity to `` tweak '' audio files , not using the RCA software was not a problem for me . However , when I connect the VR5220 to my Mac -LRB- both a notebook and desktop -RRB- , it does not show up ... at all . I ca n't very well `` simply copy '' the files when the blasted recorder does n't register with the computer . The users manual does state that Mac OSX is not supported , but the device does not live up to the label 's statements . As a recorder , it is good . I like its functions , but I dislike being misled . I would not have purchased this item if it had not said that I could connect it to my Mac and copy the files over . 	Voice Recorder
I have been very pleased with the Olympus Voice Recorder . I carry it with me all the time . I use it to `` jot '' down notes to myself about things I need to do . It is very easy to use . I use it a lot when I am in the car and need to remember something for later . 	Voice Recorder
I purchased this device for a week of primary research interviews , and it performed superbly , even in tough audio settings , including an outdoor cafe . While the audio was n't perfect with background noise , it was more than sufficient for me to transcribe notes . The PC interface works flawlessly , and all features are as advertised . A highly recommended device . 	Voice Recorder
This is , I think , the fourth digital recorder I 've owned -- I seem to wear out the buttons after about 2-3 years of constant use . These things keep getting better and better . I use it primarily for short voice notes to myself ; I use it occasionally to record lectures or meetings . Sony did a decent job of keeping the buttons and functions down to the minimum necessary to do the job -LRB- unlike the Panasonic it replaced , which had too many buttons and too many functions -RRB- . It 's a simple device , and it works very well . I recommend the product highly , but I have two suggestions for users : First , if you 're going to record lectures , meetings , etc. , you 'll get a much clearer recording if you purchase an external -LRB- powered -RRB- microphone . I use an Audio-Technica ATR97 , and I get excellent recordings . Second , and more important : do n't convert the audio unless you have to . You can transfer the recordings to your PC with or without converting them to mp3 -LRB- wav too , I think -RRB- , but converting from Sony 's proprietary format noticeably degrades the recording . I would suggest keeping your recordings on your hard drive in Sony 's format , and only converting them when you have to . Sony 's software works fine as a simple player , and the manual tells me there 's an emailable player as well -LRB- although I have n't used this -RRB- . For those of you who do n't need to transfer recordings to your PC , Sony makes a cheaper model that skips this feature . If I could , I 'd take half a star off for the slightly muddy sound of the mp3 conversion , but that 's small change next to the strong points of this excellent , affordable tool . Thanks Sony for keeping it simple ! UPDATE , June ' 09 : The `` hold '' button fell off , rendering the device useless . Fortunately , it was still under warranty , so Sony replaced it with a refurbished unit , which looks brand-new to me -LRB- probably a store return -RRB- . However , Sony wanted to charge me $ 25 for `` labor , '' to replace this unit . I had to argue my way up through several layers of supervisor before I got someone to waive this ridiculous charge . Summary : If the hold button fell off once , it 'll fall off again . I 'm demoting this to 2 stars , and I wo n't buy Sony again . Boo Sony . 	Voice Recorder
I love this product because it 's simple to use . The quality of recording is absolutely wonderful and the connectivity to the PC is easy . It 's small and I can take it everywhere ; it can fit in my pocket or my bag . Downloading is quick and quality audio is great . I needed a digital recorder for work and my classes , and I 'm very happy with my Olympus recorder . 	Voice Recorder
Bad File Format , UNUSABLE files are randomly produced on this recorder . In my case the most important College lectures ! Thought it was associated with recording length , which would have at least provided a workaround , but no. . It 's random . You have been warned . 	Voice Recorder
Bought as a study aid and to start making Thoughts From Places clips . I 'm really happy with it = -RRB- The interface is well thought out . It 's attractive . It fits in my hand nicely . GOOD BUY = -RRB- 	Voice Recorder
"I bought the Sony Digital Voice Recorder for my husband for Christmas and he already can not live without it . <ahref=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001RB1XWK/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/189-3177956-3566257""> Sony ICD-UX71RED Digital Voice Recorder with 1GB Flash Memory </a> "	Voice Recorder
The Sony ICDUX80 is great . It is small so it easy to carry around because it slips right into my shirt pocket . I like the ability to just drag and drop files from the device . The microphone is quite sensitive and I have been able to do recording under different settings -LRB- not all , but most -RRB- . The mic just picks fine . The battery seems to run out sooner than I expected . Do n't know whether it is me because I have not been able switch off the machine when I want to . 	Voice Recorder
Avoid . I needed a recorder quickly , bought this Sanyo model and plugged it in , according to manual . It showed LOADING in its tiny screen . That was almost a year ago . Every couple of months I fool with it , try again to get it to work , but it 's still LOADING . Sanyo 's `` customer service '' seems to have been acquired from the old Soviet Union , as it very rapidly puts you in a loop and hangs up after about fifteen minutes . Comrade . I went and bought another Sanyo whan I was in Europe . An Xacti . It works fine . 	Voice Recorder
I 've been using this device for about 18 months , primarily to record lectures and classes at school . In general , it is a decent little unit : easy to use and the sound quality and capacity are acceptable . It 's proven itself to be very durable - having lived most of it 's life at the bottom of a backpack filled with heavy books & etc. , as well as coming through several inadvertent trips from my desk to the floor without even a scratch . The user interface is a bit quirky and takes some getting used to . For instance , I 'm still puzzled by the power on\/off switch 's behavior - which is labeled `` Hold '' and works differently depending on whether a recording is in progress or not . This has led to me occasionally accidentally draining the batteries due to the unit still being `` on '' when I thought I 'd turned it off . The included recording-file download & management software is reasonably easy to use , and seems to be more stable and usable than most vendor-supplied `` helpful '' software tools . The only real issues I have with it are the no-frills functionality and the speed with which it copies files from the recorder . On the other hand , I 'd much rather have this unit 's simple , basic , stable functionality than a quirky and buggy feature-rich alternative ! As for sound quality , the voice recordings are clear , and the microphone works well even in large rooms with a soft-voiced teacher . I usually have some `` hiss '' and background `` warbling '' in the recordings ; but then again , I 'm not looking for concert quality - just the ability to replay a lecture or perhaps share it with a fellow student who missed class that day . The only two significant issues I have with the unit are : First , that the `` clock '' stops while the battery is being changed . In light of this , the unit requires you to verify the time whenever the batteries are replaced - annoying when you 're trying to change batteries during class . This leads to the second point , which is that the `` low battery '' indication is almost useless . There is no `` meter '' , just a chime and onscreen indicator warning you of a `` low battery '' at a single preset point . When using alkaline batteries , the span in time between the warning and the batteries dying is just a minute or two - which means you WILL get stuck from time to time , having to change batteries in the middle of a lecture . Using extended life batteries works much better - not only for having to face this conundrum much more rarely , but also the time delay from warning to battery death is much longer - usually 10-15 minutes - often enough to at least get me to a class break before the batteries die . This unit has proved to be good `` safety net '' for going back to catch important comments I missed while taking notes in class , and has been a good rehearsal tool for presentations . I could see it being equally useful in meetings . All in all , this unit - while not perfect - does the job well , and without alot of fuss . I 'll give it four stars . 	Voice Recorder
We use the recorder every month to record our board meetings and it works flawlessly every time . It was well worth the price . 	Voice Recorder
Every recorder records crisp clear recordings . Every recorder now days has recording only when something is spoken . Every recorder has generous recording space and execellent battery life . They all have nifty features like low frequency filters . The Olympus WS-210S is no different . After carefully examining reviews and features between Sony and Olympus models , I chose Olympus . I felt the olympus models were rated slightly better than the competetors , and it was less expensive while having the same quality of features . One feature I need to have was USB transfering . USB is attached to the recoder itself ! No cords ! Sony converted their recordings to MP3 , while Olympus , to WMA . I prefer MP3 since its smaller in size and more convient when adding to my iPod . Since I prefered MP3 , why did I choose Olympus ? In my search for a model , Olympus had a quality voice recorder for $ 15 less than Sony 's counterpart . There are many free programs on the web that easily converts WMA audio into MP3 in a snap . Saving money , while getting a quality recorder that I am very happy with , the decision was simple .

I recently bought a MacBookPro and needed a digital voice recorder that was compatible with a Mac and PC . The Olympus is easy to use and downloads on both computers . 	Voice Recorder
I bought this to take notes -LRB- instead of paper -RRB- and I like it a lot . I started using it without even reading any instructions , so it 's easy to use . The sound quality is most adequate for voice -LRB- not for music , though -RRB- . The shape is reasonable , although I wish it were a bit smaller -LRB- hence the 4 stars -RRB- . Controls are a bit small , but easy to use . Built-in mic is plenty good enough for voice . Large and clear screen . Very happy with it . 	Voice Recorder
This recorder costs 1\/3 of what I paid for my last Olympus recorder , and it does everything I need . 	Voice Recorder
This is a very user friendly item , and it interfaces nicely with a computer . I 've downloaded sound files off of it onto my Mac . Very intuitive . But also very small , and I 've already lost it a couple times . Luckily , I found it again , too . 	Voice Recorder
It 's an easy-to-use recorder , and it includes USB connectivity , which enables you to save your recordings to your computer 	Voice Recorder
I love this unit , the instructions are so easy to read and the recorder itself is easy to use . It has a lot of features that I have not used yet but like the idea that I can if I choose to . I would recommend this recorder to people that are not electronically savy as well as those that are . It was delivered on time and the packaging is excellent . 	Voice Recorder
I placed an order for this when it was IN STOCK for next day delivery !! , and the delivery date was changed 3 TIMES . No one at AMAZON can give a good explaination !!!! Just the same pre written sorry speach . Some PRIME SERVICE !!!! 	Voice Recorder
First off , I have the ... PC version , so all other aspects outside of PC interfacing apply to this unit . Due to the weird 4 bit CELP + ADPCM recording format you can not use any burning software to transfer the recordings to CD . Even thru the supplied Olympus software which you MUST use to transfer from the recorder to PC this feature does not exist ! My planned use was for recording University lectures and then transferring them to CD 's categorized by exam material covered to listen to while in my car . The only way I can do this is to leave the material on the recorder and use it to listen to the recordings in the car which works in regards to ability to listen but it is not ideal in that aspect . ALSO , after 4 weeks of lectures the recorder is now full using XHQ quality setting which is necessary for recordings made in areas with sufficient ambient noise such as creeking stadium chairs , rustling papers , etc. . Of course I figured thius out after tossing the blister pack it came in and am now stuck with it ! Other wise I have no complaints so if this feature is not of importance then go for it . 	Voice Recorder
If I could rate it 0 stars I would . Here 's what happened : I unwrapped it . I plugged it into my USB drive . Windows found it and began to load drivers for it . A few seconds later , POP and a fizzle . It shorted out and the AAA battery exploded . Its non-functional garbage and downright dangerous . Also , I rarely give product reviews but this time I felt compelled to do so . It would cost more to send it back , its already in the trash outside . 	Voice Recorder
I have 2 of these recorders and they work fine . However since I upgraded my computer to Vista from Xp , I am not able to transfer the digital files from the recorder to my pc . I have not been able to find any further driver info on the Olympus website . Email going to Olympus gets me an automated confirmation of receipt but never a followup answer . Hopefully someday Olympus will come up with the Vista driver . 	Voice Recorder
PROS : 1 . Low cost . 2 . Very clear recordings . 3 . Built in rechargable battery thrue USB port . 4 . Simple controls -LRB- ON and OFF -RRB- . 5 . A single LED ready light for recording , charge , and low battery . 6 . Records for up to 35 hours -LRB- but battery `` only '' lasts 13 hours -RRB- . 7 . Very small -LRB- it 's a USB stick -RRB- . 8 . Records each voice message consecutively . CONS : 1 . No built-in playback AT ALL . 2 . Must have a computer or smart phone with USB port to hear your recordings . CONCLUSION For me , it 's worth the 15 bucks , but it would be a five star item if it played back too , but then that would add a few layers of electronics , cost , and complexity if you wanted to hear your recordings in a non-linear fashion ; not to mention the small piezio speaker , audio amplifier , and extra firmware required . Most importantly , however , this little device is so simple to use that I can now safely record messages while driving my car , since I do n't have to look down at its controls to do so -LRB- much less face the dangers of using a pen to write in a note pad while on the road !! -RRB- . 	Voice Recorder
I have been using a small hand-held tape recorder up to now . I use it solely in the car to make myself `` note '' , thus I basically need it to record and then for me to listen to the `` notes '' at the office and then erase . I have found an LARGE difference between the tape and digital recorder as far as sound quality . It is much better . It also very small and light to transport -- very easy to put in a pocket . Actually it is so light , several times I forgot to take it out of my pocket when I got to the office ! Because of my `` simple '' operations , I do not need all the file folders , etc that come with it . I 've had problems getting used to the buttons for operation -- especially to review the tape , but that is probably user error . If you are using it in low light -LRB- in the car at night -RRB- it there is no lighted LED so that you can easily see what the screen is telling you to do . All in all , it 's a very good machine for the money . I 'd buy it again . 	Voice Recorder
I purchased this device to record my law class lectures . The class is in a large auditorium with probably over 400 students typing away at their laptops . I had been skeptical about whether or not the recordings would be useable at all , especially given the fact that I could take equally -LRB- un -RRB- useable recordings on my own laptop . I 'm blown away . I sit on the balcony of the auditorium -LRB- furthest possible location from the professor -RRB- and even on days when his mic does n't work , the playback is crystal clear , and there is very little static . Comparing a laptop recording vs. a DVR recording is n't even a fair comparison . The DVR records beautifully without also recording the tapping of the keyboard in the background . I 'm thoroughly impressed . The price is a little steep for a college student , but now that I have it , I do n't go to any class without it . One more note : I LOVE that it can record in mp3 format , since I have a Mac , and this allows me to import it into my iTunes as well . 	Voice Recorder
Not a very good recorder at all . The voice playback is horrible and the main reason I purchased this product because it is advertised as being USB PC capable . The player created files using . VOC file extension which can not be played by my regular media players -LRB- Windows Media , Itunes , Real Player -RRB- The DVM RCA Digital voice manager software I had to hunt the internet for and download does n't play the files either . I can not find any freeware VOC converters and in fact the only file converters that I found I would have to pay an additional $ 24 . Its a real hair puller . 	Voice Recorder
I really like this little recorder . I use it primarily for choir rehearsals and to practice music . Some notes on other reviewers comments . Out of the box it does only last 10 minutes but the rechargeable battery does not come charged and needs 3 hours in the USB . This would be a good time to read the PDF which is on the recorder . 92 pages and easy to read . There are some awkward language phrases , but it is entirely understandable and written by an intelligent person . The menus are easy to navigate . It has many options for microphone sensitivity and recording format . The WMA which is the default is very clear . I used the PMC for the choir rehearsal and was very pleased . Some reviewers note a scratchy sound which is the microphone picking up contact noise from your hand or clothing . Mic sensitivity and low cut filters can probably help but I plugged in an inexpensive tie clip microphone and the problem went away completely . That external microphone was mono which was easily solved with a mono to stereo plug so both channels are playing the same signal . I found the external microphone to not be as loud as the built in ones where you can set sensitivity . I use the recorder exclusively with earbuds and sound is very adequate . It also gives nice sound plugged into a home stereo or car radio . Sound quality is excellent overall . Since it is so small , I attached a flash memory stick neck lanyard and it dangles from my neck so I have access to functions while I record . The pause feature is very nice -LRB- hit the record button again and it pauses -RRB- . It is not an obvious feature unless you read the documentation . I downloaded an album from Windows media Player very easily and sound quality is excellent . Overall I have no complaints . Some of the reviewers could have read the documentation before complaining . A small slip case would have been nice with it . I see they sell one for ten bucks . 	Voice Recorder
excellent product . I have used it extensively . It is easy to use , the sound picks up well and is easy to hear - clear with good volumn . Battery life is good . 	Voice Recorder
I bought this recorder to use with my work . I am a writer for a small newspaper and I often interview people for feature stories . The first time I used this was for a large feature which required about 3 hours of recording . It was a great help . I still ended up taking hand-written notes , but this is an excellent back-up . If I have a question about something that was said , or I 'm making a direct quote , it is easy to verify . The recorder was easy to use , very small and easy to carry , picked up voices well and play back and pause were easy to activate . The voice quality is not amazing , but not bad either . Reasonably priced . There is no computer connection but I did n't care about this anyway . In short , it operates well and does what it is supposed to at a very reasonable price . 	Voice Recorder
Everything seems to be working . The box was sent promptly , with the bare essentials included , with instructions -LRB- but I still need teaching in how to use it -RRB- . 	Voice Recorder
I was surprised how sensitive the recorder is and the batteries last a very long time . Have had absolutely no problems with it and it has exceeded my expectations . 	Voice Recorder
I had no problems what so ever using it and it 's small and easy to cary in your bag and when traveling . 	Voice Recorder
My husband and I purchased this recorder for more personal reasons . We both have horrible snoring problems . Instead of going for the sleep test which I was told to do - we started using the recorder at night . I am not the one with the snoring problem !!! My husband is and it 's clear as a bell on tape - even when he wakes up and tells me he was in a sound sleep and ca n't believe I woke him up with my snoring . Love this little , lightweight , easy to use gadget . 	Voice Recorder
This is a great unit which we used for the TRANS-ALLEGHENY LUNATIC ASYLUM ghost tour . My only beef is that they do not give you a wrist strap to carry the unit , but it does have the spot for one to go . In the end i put it in the strap of my headlamp and it worked well . Noo evp 's for us !! It did fall once to the floor from 6 feet , but not a scratch on it , and the sound file closed properly . Another small petpeve is that you have to hit the stop button multiple times to get the unit to charge when plugged into a pc , if you get the timing wrong it connects to the pc but does not charge at all . I 'm happy with my purchase , and think everyone else will be too . This baby has plenty of space , and lasts a long time on the single AAA rechargable battery . 	Voice Recorder
I bought this product in a rush and because this product was among the bestseller list . . what they failed to note here is : YOU CA N'T BACK UP YOUR DATA because there is no USB cable connection ... how sad is that ??? In such a modern era , why would anyone create a device that they ca n't back up ?? Obviously this is not a product for a reporter . . are they expect us to store our recording in this device only ? Does n't make sense right . . ? 	Voice Recorder
I bought this system over a month ago , and have been unable to use it . It was advertised as mac compatible , and labeled as such when it arrived . Problem is , after spending close to 100 hours trying , I can not even come close to downloading the operating software . I have sent messages to the Sony help site , no response . The dragon Nuance site is equally silent . As if Tough Stuff dude , we got your money , we think its funny , now go away . Not very professional . Do n't buy . 	Voice Recorder

I purchased the VN-4100 in Jul 2007 and was pleased with it 's overall performance and operation until I had to replace the dead batteries for the third time -- nothing but `` ERR '' comes up on the screen and nothing will overcome this problem -- now it is junk . 	Voice Recorder
Before buying this digital voice recorder , I was a little skeptical because of the not-so-high average rating on here . However , I must say that this thing works great . It does what it 's supposed to do with no problems . The Extra High Quality recording option is great . The only 2 slight minuses are 1 -RRB- it takes a few minutes to transfer a 50minute file onto the computer , but if you 're not in a rush , then there 's nothing to worry about , and 2 -RRB- for some reason , after transferring the files , they wo n't play in Windows Media Player , even though they are wav files , but they do work in other media software such as iTunes and Realplayer . The battery life is good -LRB- have not changed batteries yet and I 've recorded over 10 hours -RRB- , it is light , small , and easy to carry . Overall , I highly recommend this product . 	Voice Recorder
Good product - Lots of features but one AAA battery is not enough ... should have another AAA battery so that you can play back recordings with greater speaker volume -LRB- top volume of speaker is currently on the weak side -RRB- 	Voice Recorder
Great Product . Easy to use . Compact . Has easy to use controls and the quality of sound is far better than I expected . 	Voice Recorder
Really easy to use . I did n't even need the manual on how to use it . Took me 5-7 mins tops to figure out everything ! 	Voice Recorder

This watch is a classic . It was awesome when I was 12 , and it 's awesome now ; if a bit smaller . It 's the perfect size ; big enough to read , but small enough to not bug .

I purchased this watch a week before my arrival in N.Y. and I could hardly wait to see it . Although it 's a man 's watch -LRB- nowadays women are using larger watches -RRB- and I 'm not a diver , I really love it and I 'm very happy with my purchase . I 've also received many compliments and people ca n't believe it costs less than $ 100 . 	Watch
This is the 3rd time I 've bought this watch . Got my first one about 19 years ago . My kids were young and I loved the 3 , 5 , 10 min timers -- great for ` time outs ' . About 10 years ago the part of the watch that attaches to the band broke . Then I replaced the watch - with the same one . After all these years , the band finally broke . I could n't find another band for it at a reasonable price , and was thrilled to find the exact watch on Amazon -- along with its stainless steel cousin . I got them both . 	Watch
For the money its very nice . Band seems a little cheap but thats the only fault . Overall what can you ask for at $ 20 ? Its worth the money . 	Watch
I 've bought several of these watches . Like the others , I appreciate the functions and the simplicity . Unfortunately , this watch uses a very cheap method of plating chrome metal over a plastic base . After 1-2 years of wear , this plating fails , and seperates from the base material . This creates very sharp little `` knife blades '' on the edge of the case . With the stretch band , you have to pull it on\/off over your hand . The back of my hand is always covered with scratches caused by the plating on the watch case . So , I have several of these , still running perfectly , in drawers un-usable . A poor manufacturing\/design . I would assume the gold is similar . 	Watch
I 'm a watch fanatic and have a collection of all brands different prices . When I wear this watch people flip over it ! It 's very sporty and I could n't believe the low price . The first one I received had a setting button that came out . I notified the dealer and they replaced it promptly no questions asked . The watch has a ten year warranty . This is one cool watch and has become one of my favorites . You get a lot for the money ! It 's much better looking than the picture and the picture looks good . Also the watch is very comfortable to wear . I have several watches with the silicone -LRB- rubber -RRB- band and I like them the best . 	Watch
It is more a jewelry than a watch , but looks elegant , and it is good value . Do not expect some size , because it looks little bit smaller , but if the girl is also skinny , it will fit perfectly . 	Watch
I was given this watch as I chose it over the 1\/1000sec stopwatch g-shock . I 'm really glad that I did that because it simply does n't disappoint . Rightly so , as on the g-shock website , 3 out of 6 `` g-shock toughness tests '' uses the mudman . Many people have said too that it 's arguably the toughest g-shock out there . As far as water resistance goes , this thing is a champ . I 've swam in the sea a couple of times for hours at a go and even had mud harden all over it but as you can guess it works perfectly fine . I 've bathed with this watch on several hundred times and pressed the buttons under water and it still does n't compromise . It has become a tool I know I can rely on all the time , in any condition . It was once frozen in ice at -LRB- -20 deg cel for a couple of hours , but after beating off the ice it still worked fine . The resin case is rather element-resistant I must say . I wonder what would happen to an ordinary watch which is subjected to the same harsh conditions as this watch . The 2 stopwatches and timers have been very well utilised by me , and the 5 sec countdown for the stopwatch has been of great help as well . Perhaps the only downside I can think of is that the alarm is really soft . What 's the point of having 5 alarms if none can wake you up ? Having said that , the multiple alarms are a good reminder throughout the day for me , as long as I am awake ! As far as accuracy is concerned , I doubt it 's terribly accurate . Loses or gains seconds quite a bit . The size of this thing is still huge , even though it 's smaller than other g-shocks . Rather light but slightly bulky . I 'm starting to think that this watch is much tougher than what I 'd ever need . After all , who can survive where this watch wo n't ? Besides , if I 'd ever do trekking in Antarctica or mountain climbing , I 'd need to know more than just the time . Perhaps the altitude or temperature or my coordinates . I 've had this watch on when skydiving , when on my police duties and when on holidays . It 's stuck with me everywhere i 've been . If ordinary watches would last long , how much more this mudman ? Chew on that ! 	Watch
I love this watch !!!!! I it is a great watch . I do traveling a lot and i just set it for the 2 time zones and i do n't have to keep changing my watch or mentally taking or adding an hour . 	Watch
This is a really wonderful Invicta watch . I 'm not a diver or anything , just someone who likes big faced watches and Invicta is always in my collection . This watch you will not find anywhere else , especially places like JC Penney or the watch stores in Malls . It 's hard to find and is an eye catches at night with its glow in the dark numbers . A lady actually knocked on my window and asked to see this watch ! 	Watch
Its one of the best watches Ive ever purchased . Gives the look and feel of a 300-400 $ watch . Great buy . Would recommend it to everyone ! 	Watch
Clock is hard to see , especially at night . The backlight is dim , and the numbers dark . I purchased the clock through Amazon without looking around , and I was disappointed . I have since found several other travel alarms that were cheaper , easier to use , and see at night . 	Watch
This watch had been with me for 5 years and was very reliable . one thing i did not appreciate that there was no light . but the sttings were great . back then i got it for $ 20.00 . and now its so cheap . overall , this is one handy watch . 	Watch
This has lots of great features my husband -LRB- Army soldier -RRB- really likes , his only gripe is the band , but that 's easily changed . The display is a little on the small side , but the features make up for that , like the dual time zones . Great all around watch ! 	Watch
With all the options It 's a little to much Can change to Feet and Fahrenheit for us dumb Americans and a bit smaller then the other pathfinders I 've owned . 	Watch
I have been buying this same watch about once every 5 years , for about 20 years ! It is the only Ladies ' DIGITAL Watch that is the perfect size for a LADY 'S wrist ! Many other Ladies ' watches might be similar size or smaller , but they are not digital . It is very comfortable with the plastic band , and you can always replace with a leather band if you prefer . The buttons are easy to use and it 's easy to set the alarm or set for timedown from now to a few minutes . I LOVE this WATCH ! 	Watch
I really like this watch . The movement sticks sometimes , but always unsticks itself just as quick . Great looking watch and a great price . 	Watch
I loved this watch for the first 3 years but it started shutting off because it needed to be charged . The problem continued to get worse until it was shutting off several times a day . I sent it in to have it fixed because I liked the watch so much but I was told it would cost $ 88.00 to fix it . It was a great watch but do n't plan on it lasting more than about 3-5 years . From looking around online this is a common problem that I wish I would have known about prior to buying the watch . I would suggest one of the battery powered G-Shock watches over the solar models . Mostly I am mad at casio , $ 88.00 to fix a $ 120.00 watch kind of sucks . 	Watch

I got the watch from a friend about 6 years ago so I have a lot of experience with the watch . Here are the pros and cons as I see it Pros Lots of functions Great Price -LRB- I gave it 5 instead of 4 stars because of the price -RRB- Easy to use Dependable -LRB- no problems with the watch itself over the years -RRB- Durable -LRB- I have had this watch on for hikes , sports , swimming in pools and beaches etc. -RRB- Cons Dim backlight -LRB- hardly ever needed it though -RRB- Plastic body -LRB- I got lots of scratches on it over the years -RRB- Band not as durable as the watch -LRB- my band burst after a couple of years and I got a generic -LRB- NOT casio -RRB- replacement band which burst about a month ago ... which is how I lost my watch -RRB- Databank doesnt make sense if you own a cell phone ... duh ! But it 's still easy enough to use All in all , it 's a great everyday watch that you can wear with confidence to take a daily beating ... everyday ... for years to come . If you buy this watch you may have to give it a name cuz it 's going to be with you for a while 	Watch
I believe the `` retail '' price of this watch is 195.00 . I would not want to pay that much for this watch , mainly because the clasp on the band does not seem to be as high quality as some of my Citizen watches . That being said , for $ 80 or $ 90 dollars this watch is well worth the money . The clasp on the band is really my only complaint about the watch . The watch its self has very nice detailing and looks and feels like a very good quality watch . I have had the watch over a month now and have not regretted the purchase . 	Watch

Hi , I 'm sure this product is great , but it 's not actually as advertised . The manual the watch comes with states that that the water resistance capacity for the watch depends on the water resistance rating on the cover of the watch . According to the manual , the water resistance rating `` Water Resistant '' only protects the watch from rain and splashes , where as the 165 ft rating would say `` Water Resistant 50m '' on the watch cover . AMAZON CHANGE THIS DETAIL ON YOUR AD . They gave me a full refund by the way . 	Watch
Last week , I ordered the new Invicta 1773 Pro Diver watch . Its a solid , lovely watch and not expensive . It can be yours for less than $ 100 on the internet and I believe that you , like me , will be happy with your purchase . I ca n't tell how long the watch will last or how hard -LRB- expensive -RRB- it will be to replace the battery . But as a purchaser online , I 'm very happy with its look , what seems to be quality manufacturing and layout . I got the blue one , but I believe there are a number of other colors to be had Invicta as a watch company was founded in 1837 in La Chaux-de-fonds , Switzerland and currently carries 5 brands of watch currently : S Coifman , Activa , Activa Kids , Potger-Piertri and Poseidon . The watches are all pretty , fairly priced and very functional . When I asked a friend that knows watches , he remarked that Invicta is known to make a pretty good watch for the price but that the prices always seem discounted . Going to Invicta Watch 's website , I found a list of MSRPs for their watches with prices stretching from $ 200 - $ 2,000 . This particular watch has a MSRP of around $ 495 but a quick search online reveals prices at less than $ 100 . The watch is heavy , a nice weight that reminds you it is there without bothering you . The band -LRB- 22 mm -RRB- is metal -LRB- and , apparently , gold but not sure how it would be gold at this price -RRB- but it does not catch arm hairs . It slots neatly beneath a cuff for a dress shirt and looks sport but professional . The clasp is a fold over with a safety and locks securely . The bezel of the watch is easy to manipulate and intuitive . The case of the watch is 44mm with a thickness of 12 mm . It is apparently water resistant to 200 meters . That 's pretty deep ... I 'm a diver and the deepest I 've ever gone was 145 feet down . The watch is a large one ... but at 6 ' 1 '' , I 'm kind of a large one myself . If you have a thin wrist or are a small person , this may not be the watch for you . If you like a bigger watch , I think you 'll love this one . 	Watch
I bought this watch to time myself while running . So far it has done the job . It counts up or down , just like I needed . One weird thing I noticed is that instead of entering a year for the date , you just change the little circled letters at the top to the current day of the week . Now that I think about it , I think I like that better than fiddling with the year . It is also really cute ! I could n't be more pleased with it . It is better than I expected . 	Watch
I love this watch ! The timer is the best feature - with the press of a button you can time things for 1 , 3 , 5 , 10 , 15 , 20 , and 30 minutes . It 's such a handy feature - I use it all the time . I 'm surprised more watches do n't have it . 	Watch
I 've had this type before and it is a great watch . The band is easy to adjust and it just keeps going forever . 	Watch
As 2 other reviewers stated , this watch is just about bullet-proof except for the band , which loves to break between 11\/2 - 2 years . And I also agree that it 's not worth changing the band more than once , the pins and the pin holes are too worn out after that . I 've very often found myself wearing the only watch that still worked after unbelieveable conditions , including extreme humidity , high heat , shock , below-freezing temps and extreme abuse . The watch laughs off jet fuel , oils , cleaning fluids and anything else I 've ever subjected it to . I buy them two at a time just to be sure I have one when my strap breaks , I 'm addicted to wearing this thing because it just keeps on going . I 'd pay more for it , but I 'm glad I do n't have to . 	Watch
I am very happy and very impressed with the watch quality , looks , and price . I have been looking at a watch like this in stores but I found this for a more reasonable price . Thank you ! 	Watch
Hard to beat this rugged , good looking timepiece . Very comfortable to wear , keeps time within 10 seconds\/day , sharp looking . 	Watch
I am initially impressed by the apparent quality of the watch , and I think it will prove to be a good purchase . The only concern that I had was the size of the watch . It is much larger than it appears in the photo , but it is accurately measured in the product description . 	Watch
My son loves this watch and is really enjoying it ! He likes that it is water proof and he enjoys all the settings . The watch came quickly ! 	Watch
The Invicta Men 's Automatic Pro Diver S2 is a beautifully elegant timepiece ! It sports a substantial look and heft , and displays similarly to very high-end watches that cost a fortune . And , it is definately a `` manly '' watch , with a feel and look to match . For me , only one facet of its beauty detracts , and this but slightly : the scalloped bezel requires a strong set of fingers to move around : This same feature , by the way , actually adds to its elegance , smoothing this watch 's lines and creating an overall `` epitome of elegance '' for the wearer . Once you get used to manipulating this bezel , you hardly think about it . In sum , I am quite happy with this very reasonably-priced and beautiful watch ! 	Watch
This is my second Seiko 5 automatic watch I have owned cheap quartz watches before this but these are a huge value for the dollar . Automatic watches are not for everyone you need to wear the watch 8 hours a day every day or buy a watch winder if you dont wear it ever it will stop and need to be reset . If you are kind of a gearhead and want a relationship with your watch these are the watches to have . Pros - High quality for the money , nice medium size not too bulky , nice smooth sweep on seconds hands not jerky like a quartz , no battery to change . Cons - day date setting at month end is a bit tricky , setting instructions not well written , must be worn every day to avoid stopping , time accuracy is decent for a mechanical watch but dont expect a quartz accuracy . I would buy another if I had a watch winder but keeping two going is my limit 	Watch
The Invicta Pro Diver Watch was quite a hit with our son . He just graduated from UCLA and was very excited to see virtually all the mechanisms of the watch . I also got a great priced that allowed me to give him some cash money , which every new graduate needs !!! 	Watch

I had a Skagen before and I liked it a lot but it had a leather band and it eventually got a little worn so wanted to get a new watch . Took a look at Amazon figuring I would probably get a good deal here and I did . My first watch was around $ 125 at a jeweler and this watch was like $ 67 including shipping so it was a great deal in comparison . It 's a very thin and elegant watch - the face changes from a cobalt blue to black as you turn it - it 's actually pretty striking and I 've had several really nice compliments on it in the few weeks I 've worn it . Diggin the 2 year warrantly as well . Whoo hoo - What 's not to like ??? 	Watch

This was a first time purchase from Amazon and I coul n't be happier . The Invicta is a beautiful watch . I have been wearing it for a couple of weeks and I am really pleased with the look and quality of this watch . I have had many compliments so far , the first being the jeweler who sized the band ! I do n't see how anyone could not be satisfied with this great quality watch at such a low price . 	Watch
I 've only owned this watch for a couple of weeks now , but I really like it . I heard that automatic watches can gain\/loss time , and this one is no different . I 've been monitoring this to see just how much change there is . Mine has gained about one minute a week ... I think that 's a microscopic inconvenience for a sub $ 100 watch that you 'll never have to put a battery in . I owned a Swiss Army chronograph before this and it was far bulkier and required a new battery about once a year . At the very least , you 'll have to set the date every other month -LRB- on average -RRB- anyway , so that would be a good time to sync the time . The face is very easy the read . Having the hours and minutes marked on the face makes it a breeze to read the exact time . The strap is not the greatest , but I like the metal loops . I 've owned many watches with `` buckle type '' straps , and I 've had all of them loss the loops long before the strap was worn out . All-in-all this is a great watch for a great price . I look forward to not having to pay for batteries or straps for many years to come ! ; -RRB- 	Watch
Could never get the small dials to zero themselves and returned it . Otherwise it is a good looking quality appearing piece . Probably just got a bad example of the model . 	Watch
I thought this watch was very cute and I dont think that it looked cheap , but it broke after I only wore it a couple times !! The strap detatched , which I was able to fix . It came without a working battery , which the seller replaced . Then one day it it just stopped ticking . I dont know what is wrong with it but I know it is n't the battery since it has a brand new one . 	Watch

I bought this watch 15 months ago in Bahrain , at a NEX . Not a fan of watches , but the band was comfortable enough for me to wear it every day , which is needed for my job . I have to say , about 2 months into owning it , the seconds and minutes hands both fell off . Being deployed at the time I had to throw it in a drawer and wait till I could take it to be repaired . Had it fixed shortly after returning to US and within 2-3 days the arms again fell off . Again I had to take it to the watchmaker for repair . I am not sure what was done differently that time but the watch has stayed together since . The dial window is exceptionally durable ; I spend 6-8 months of the year on a ship where this watch is beat to hell . Recently I have noticed the second Loop on the band has a small tear , not a big deal considering what it is put through . I also get many complements on the watch and have been offered well over the retail price for it by several individuals . Keep in mind these were on ship which has a higher demand and price of Items due to wait times for any kind of ordered item -LRB- 1-3 Months -RRB- . I am very happy with this watch and would have giving it full stars if arms had stayed put from the start . 	Watch

I bought this watch on sale years ago for normal daily wear . I thought it looked rugged , but I had no idea just how rugged it truly was until I took up SCUBA diving . It survived life banging around boats for weeks on end as I literally traveled around the world . I wore it on hundreds of SCUBA dives up to 140 feet below the surface . Whether getting me get back to the surface before my air ran out or getting me to a sidewalk cafe before a blind date ran out this watch was always there for me . My Casio G-Shock never stopped running , it never leaked and never it let me down . I ca n't recommend it highly enough . 	Watch
I have had Casio Watches for more than 30 years . This is a great watch at a great price . Cant wait to start hiking to test it on the go . Currently I am getting familiarized with its manual . I suggest to go to Casio.com and download the Manual so it can be read in larger format . 	Watch
I have not owned an automatic watch before so I ca n't compare the time-keeping ability to others , but that is the only negative I can find on this watch so far . It keeps pretty good time though , although not near as well as a quartz watch . It seems to get a minute or 2 off after a week . I own a few Citizens and Seiko 's and it compares equally to these as far as quality of watch and band\/bracelet . The band and watch both are solid and packaged well . The band re-sized easily and I had no trouble having the pins go in and stay in . It also has a screw-down crown which I do n't think the specs mention but I think is important in a watch that is going to go underwater . Once the price dropped to seventy I could not resist and so far I have been extremely happy with the purchase . 	Watch
This watch is beautiful . Its legit Michael Kors . I get so many compliments on it . Its made to last . 	Watch
I have used this model of Casio Databank Digital Watch for over 20 years . In my agricultural business , my watch is exposed to temperature extremes , water , dirt , and impact abuse at times . It has always performed flawlessly . I routinely use the calculator and stopwatch functions for important calibrations we use for monitoring irrigation equipment and fertilizer and chemical calibrations . I used the telephone index and calculator years before cell phones with these functions were in existence . I still rely on my Casio for more than just telling time on a daily basis . This is a wonderful watch ! 	Watch
I love this watch . I have been looking for just the right watch for the last 4 years , I even bought a Victorinox for more than twice the price , that I like , not love . You get more than you pay for , though it is an automatic and you will gain or loose some time . Mine seems to be .01 sec fast ... but in reality , I 'm not a super spy , and I have a cell phone , so maybe once every week or two I set it back a min as needed . If you really wanted you could take it to a trusted jeweler and have it `` tuned up '' . But for the price , the movement is beautiful and the clear backing is mezmorizing -LRB- sorry ` bout my spelling -RRB- . The styling is perfect , has an old school feel with modern `` slickness '' , as my father would say . The face is smaller , which was a selling point for me ... there seems to be a big watch trend , I hate that . I wear my watch 24hrs\/day 7 days a week -LRB- I do take it off to take a shower though -RRB- , the size of this face is perfect ; form , style and function . The only thing that I did to it was replace the band , I love the NATO style bands , the fit can be tailored perfectly . I LOVE THIS WATCH , and though I am drunk on this fabulous time piece at the moment , of course , I see myself wearing it for many years to come -LRB- the last watch I had was a timex and I wore it for 5 years till the battery died -RRB- . P.S. I know that 5 stars is almost cleche ' but I feel that it is appropriate here . 	Watch
Item received brand new and very well packed . the watch came with plastic protector around the watch ! excellent packaging by invicta . that should be the way how new watch should be packed . Will let it run for some time in the box before I can tell if the item is good . This gold tone is really stunning and irresistable . 	Watch

I purchased this sports watch to wear on hikes , around town , etc. . It does n't get any hard use . Right after I got it , I was in a field during photography and someone found the watch on the ground with one pin pulled out . I wrote to the seller and received back a computer generated note that basically said `` we are going to doing nothing to help you . '' I took it to an excellent watch maker and the had to completely reconfigure the watch band and customize new pins because even after replacing the pins with different types , any pull on the watch band would make it fall apart . I now have $ 20 invested in a brand new watch for a total of $ 115.00 . The jeweler said the band was causing the problem . I liked the band at first ... it is made of a canvas material which will absorb moisture in the hot weather and it is easy to buckle . The other problem is that if you have more than one watch and you switch back and forth , it will stop working given that it needs movement to self wind . In 24 hours it will stop and you will have to reset the time and the date , which is a pain . The watch is very thick , which precluded you from buttoning a long sleeve shirt . Mine also kept very poor time . I was having to reset it daily . If you want to waste your money on a poorly designed watch , this one is for you ! The seller is operating at the same poor level as the watch ... they are a good match . 	Watch
This sure would be a five star watch for me except for my problems with the crystal . Now , I 'm the sort of fellow who is a wee bit hard on his stuff , which is a big part of why I chose to buy this Invicta instead of a more expensive watch . This is why I like diver 's watches , because they 're durable . But within 2 weeks of buying the watch I hit it against a door frame as I was walking through it and put a nice ding in the crystal at 12 o'clock , big enough so that air could pass through to the watch face . Being impatient by nature , I thought it would be worth $ 30 to $ 40 to have the watch fixed rather than deal with the hassle and time of using the warranty . My local watch repair shop got the part Fed-Ex 'd from Invicta overnight , and it was indeed worth the cost ... for about 2 weeks , when I did exactly the same thing , this time putting a very-small-but-noticeable-to-me nick in the magnifying glass date window . Now , I know I 'm making myself sound like some sort of goofy klutz who breaks things , but I 'm really not . I carried an automatic Citizen for years on my wrist , which I was trying to replace with this , and banged it just like I describe above many , many times with no adverse event . I do love the way it looks and feels , but I do n't think I would buy this watch again , as it has not been a hassle free experience . 	Watch
Good looking watch for my son , he loves camo ! Problem is after less than 2 months , it has stopped working ; not the Timex quality I have experienced in my earlier days . It is still under warranty , but they want half the cost of the watch for shipping and processing which helped me to decide to just get a different watch all together . Bottom line , this is a cool looking watch and your children will really enjoy it ... for about a month . 	Watch
When my wife gave me a $ 100 gift card for Christmas , it was hard to decide what to use it for . I enjoy collecting watches and had always admired the Invicta line . So I decided to indulge myself and get one . I was very careful about choosing the model I wanted and read extensively online , including Amazon reviews . The online ordering process was simply and it arrived on time . As expected , I had to go to a jeweler to get the band properly sized . I did that within an hour of it 's arrival and have been wearing it every minute since . The watch is beautiful and keeps perfect time . I could not be more pleased with the whole transaction including the watch itself . If you are looking for a quality product at a very reasonable price , check out Invicta watches at Amazon.com .

The time and date at your fingertips . Very long life and reliability . Well-known to be the favorite of people who REALLY need a reliable watch with long life and accuracy . Highly recommended ! The strap is the one thing that people with skin allergies may want to reconsider and get a nylon with velcro strap instead . Other than that , I have never had any complaints from owning one of these . Enjoy ! I am now updating my review . So far so good on the skin allergy due to the strap . I did get it a little wet the other day and that is when I got a little itch under the strap on my skin but no rash developed . I would recommend to keep it away from water even though it is water-resistant so as to counteract any skin allergy you may have to the resin in the strap . I am very glad I purchased this now ! Once again , enjoy ! 	Watch

I like watches . I did my research on this awesome piece and when I was convinced -LRB- as you should be -RRB- it was sold out everywhere I looked . Do n't hesitate . No picture on the internet ... no video on the planet can prepare you for how awesome this watch is on your wrist . Others have already said it ... it is sleek , light , super comfortable , and when you wear it , everyone in the room who has a watch on will be trying yours on . I am convinced it does n't get much better . I am buying a second for a dear friend . F your Tag , rolex , avicta , cartier , blah blah blah . This piece is the real deal . Simply put , every man should own this watch . 	Watch
This is a basic watch ; it did what I expected it to , which was really to have an alarm instead of using my cell phone . It has a stopwatch but no countdown feature , which I sort of wanted , but oh well . The real problem is this watch is less than a year old and is already broken . I do n't know what broke it but one morning I realized the bottom of the case near the strap pin cracked . I can still use the watch as an alarm but I ca n't wear it on my wrist . I wo n't be buying a new Casio after this experience . 	Watch

The Casio AQ150W-1EV is a very sleek and comforting watch which is 100 % worth the purchase . If your the type of person who keeps their watch on while working out or exercising this is the watch for you sometimes you may forget that your even wearing it . Also the this watch is amazing waterproof , it was raining heavily one day and I did n't know that I was wearing my watch I got completely soaked but my watch was just fine . Had this watch for about a moth or 2 so far and still loving it . 	Watch
I bought this watch about 8 months ago . Love Casio as they give you a lot for little money . However just recently the case broke where the band pin fits in . I honestly think its a design flaw with the model as its made from a very brittle plastic and the pin hole is right where the mold is joined together . Like I said , I love Casio but I would get another model . Sooo sad that its broken . I have Casio watches much older and they still work . 	Watch

This is my first Timex watch that does not keep accurate time . It runs 5 to 7 minutes late every day . I do not recommend this watch . Even for the low price , give today 's technology , and the Timex reputation , a Timex watch should keep accurate time . Oops ! gota go . I 'm late ! 	Watch

Couldnt decide a watch to buy . I wanted a watch that would go with dress or casual . This is the watch to do that in . The silver is two tone . A shiny and almost like a stainless color it blends well . in the sun it is shiny but still am able to tell the time . at night the hands glow green . Absolutely a awesome watch . If you need to remove a link no need for a jeweler , look at the inside of the band there are arrows on which way to push pin out . All you need is a small metal object to push pins out and remove the watch . I like this watch so much that I will be buying the 9211 that is the white face version . 	Watch
This particular Invicta does catch the eye . The drawback here was the length of the band ; way too short . Would be ideal for a guy with small wrists . Weight of the timepiece is substantially lighter . For the price it was quite an exceptional deal aside from the band issue . With time the leather stretches a bit . 	Watch

While this watch appeared to be a lovely watch . Within a few months of purchase , the stem locked in place and can not be used to adjust the watch . Yes , there is a warranty . The watch , however , cost $ 60 on Amazon , and the warranty fee is $ 29 to return it to Invicta -LRB- which happens to be located about 3 miles from my home , but they do not allow you to drop off defective items -RRB- . It does not seem worthwhile to spend 50 % of the cost of the watch on a repair within the first four months after purchase . Very disapointing ! 	Watch
I bought this watch for my boyfriend 's birthday . He loves it because not only does it look sharp but it 's big enough for him being 6 ' 4 '' , 300lbs with large hands . I love it because I saved a lot of money buying it from Amazon instead of a jewelry store . It 's a great masculine watch that 's versitle enough for casual days as well as nice nights out . 	Watch
I love the watch . I 'm wearing it everyday . I use the timer to time my lunch breaks , cooking time and laundry . It 's stylish and it 's great help in managing time . Unfortunately it does n't have light , and I ca n't see it in the dark ... otherwise , it 'd have been prefect !! ... ... ... . . It has been 2 years , and I 'm liking it more and more . I work in a lab and the tests need to be timed , so this little timer is real handy . Plus it 's water resistant ! One of the most useful things I 've ever bought . 	Watch
Every now and again a watch from Invicta comes out and I can not simply fathom the low prices they command with the looks they have . I realize that the Invicta $ MSRP price is really no indication on what the watch actually sells for . I 've found most of the models sell for 20-30 % of the original $ MSRP . This watch may not have Swiss movements but it makes up for it with a beautiful crown , dial and sub-dials . The bezel is beautiful , in fact I can not fault the watch in any way cosmetically and aesthetically . This watch is almost a Rolex Daytona Replica and I have been stopped and asked if it was a Daytona , although I would absolutely love a Rolex I ca n't afford the $ 20,000 that a Daytona commands . Invicta have thus produced a very pleasing time piece , it looks the part and the movement is n't terrible , for the price I would challenge you to find a better watch , it would be difficult , especially in this price range . Invicta has done the `` Speedway '' range justice and the watch itself is very handsome . 	Watch
I like it . For the price it makes a good daily watch and fits large wrists very well . I have a 8-3\/4 '' wrist and it fits perfectly . It 's about 42mm wide so if you have large wrists like I do you may wish you had gone with something larger , which is why I recently ordered an Invicta Grand Diver -LRB- 47mm -RRB- as a second watch . The finish on the 8926 is quite good but I wish the movement were more accurate . I 'm used to quartz movements so the 15 second per day variance has taken some getting used to . I was expecting something better . It 's not a major thing unless you are a stickler for accuracy . I have no real need for a precision time piece so adjusting it once a week is not actually a big deal . The bubble magnifier over the date is pretty useless . This has been a major gripe of many Invicta owners , and why it has not been addressed by now is disappointing . There is no hacking - you ca n't stop the second hand while setting the time . Since it gains 15 seconds a day there is really no reason to get twisted over the inability to stop it while resetting the watch . This is my first Invicta and I 'm hoping my Grand Diver arrives in one piece and looks as detailed as this one . There have been many discussions about quality issues with Invicta but mine came well packed and in great shape . For the price I did n't expect perfection but I did get what I asked for and wanted . 	Watch
I have over 2 dozen watches , and this quickly became a favorite , even though it 's among the least expensive I own . In the two months I 've owned it , it 's lost less than a second , so its accuracy is very acceptable to me . The watch is by far the largest one I own . It 's HUGE . It gets plenty of attention when I wear it with short sleeves . I can operate the chronometer while wearing gloves . I wear it more often than any of my other watches . The strap that came on it was too short for me -LRB- I have 81\/2 '' circumference wrists -RRB- . So I emailed Invicta and asked if they could supply a longer strap . In 24 hours I received this reply : `` Thank you for contacting Invicta . Unfortunately the band that comes with the 3449 Corduba Collection is our standards men size and we do not carry anything smaller in a leather band . If you have any questions or concerns please do not hesitate to inquire . '' I wrote again emphasizing I wanted a longer strap , not a shorter one . I never received a response . So I bought a longer strap from a local jeweler . A brown one that goes with the ivory color of the watch face better than the original black strap . And a butterfly deployant in brushed stainless to match the case of the watch . I 'm happy . I have come to learn that this watch is a copy of a U-BOAT watch . Check out the U-BOAT CLASSICO CA 925 or the U-BOAT FIGHTDECK CAS BE and you 'll see what I mean . 	Watch
This watch is very useful , and I really like it . I only got it yesterday , but , so far I have used it often . It is easy to read and operate , and the instruction manual is simple and concise . I highly suggest it for anyone who is bad at math . 	Watch
I am not a `` watch freak '' by any means , but I was looking for a solid automatic watch that would keep reliable time . This watch seems to be doing that very well . I have had it a little over a month now , and it is working great , no scratches or marks wearing it every day performing a variety of tasks . I 'd say it does run slightly fast , but only by a few seconds a day . This may even out over time . Very satisfied ! 	Watch
If you work in a corporate environment this is a very nice elegant yet inexpensive watch to wear daily to work . The movement is smooth and the watch looks great overall . Solid but not heavy and the face is clean and easy to read - I really like the magnified date window inset . 	Watch
Although Amazon had a picture with a ruler -LRB- indicating the size -RRB- , I did n't realize just how large it was until it arrived . It was enormous - I have never seen a watch this large before , it looked like it was built for Andre the Giant . I ended up buying a normal size watch . 	Watch
the pull out set dial thing is a bit big , but nice watch nice model , especially for 20 $ it will probably not fit if you have a bigger than average size wrist . 	Watch
I bought this watch nearly two years ago -LRB- Fall 2003 -RRB- and absolutely love it . The accuracy is amazing thanks to the nightly satellite feed from Fort Collins and the display still shows the battery 's charge as `` high '' thanks to the solar recharging feature . The watch takes a lot abuse and still looks practically new . In short it 's a tough , accurate , long lasting watch . Unless you 're a style maven -LRB- I 'm not -RRB- it 's the only watch you 'll need . The one small ` but ' here is the lack of a countdown feature . My old Casio G-Shock watch which was given to me in 1990 had this feature and I 'm stumped why Casio would leave this one out when there are so many other features on this watch that do not seem as important as a countdown capability . EDIT : As of May 2007 I have had this watch for nearly four years : it still keeps perfect time and the battery charge is still on `` HIGH '' . Great watch except for the lack of countdown feature . EDIT : Beginning in the summer of 2008 the watch 's battery began losing it 's charge despite lots of exposure to solar power . At this point , the watch only lasts a couple of days before needing to be charged . This means all functions stop working until charging . I 've learned from Casio that you can not have the battery replaced locally and that you have to mail it in to a speciality shop in California . My previous Casio G-shock -LRB- regrettably misplaced -RRB- ran on a conventional battery yet ran perfectly for the fourteen years that I owned it . This one is limping along after only five years . It makes me wonder whether the solar charged watch is really a good idea and makes me re-think my four star rating . 	Watch
I ca n't exactly explain why , but I found this watch on Amazon while looking for something else and became fixated on it . I must have had it in my Wish List for several months before deciding to treat myself for Christmas to this . I got it the day before Christmas and am delighted with my purchase . The watch itself is incredibly good looking - masculine - large - very easy to read numerals . The luminescence on the hands is brighter than on any watch I have ever owned . The red sweep second hand contrasts nicely with the stark functional backdrop of the white-on-black watch face . The watch seems larger than what is displayed on the Amazon site , but not so large that it resembles a pop-art watch or anything . You just wo n't mistake it for a unisex time piece . But the canvas strap is funky . It looks like Citizen had inherited some surplus Army tents and made watch bands out of them . Where the watch looks better than how Amazon displays it , the strap looks worse . I had a spare black leather band from another watch and replaced the canvas with a much better looking strap .

We used to use Duracell but have found they do n't last even half as long as the Energizer brand . I am able to get over a year out of the Energizer on my exercise heart monitor band . 	Watch
This Timex is exactly what you think it is and does what it needs to do . Small , light and tough for everyday use . It arrived promptly after order exactly as advertised and performed the same way . Get this watch and you will not be disappointed . Product and seller rated 5 out of 5 stars . 	Watch
I love this watch ! I have a small wrist and the face covers the top of my wrist completely and it is kind of heavy for my small wrists but its a small price to pay for how cute this watch looks stacked with my bracelets ! I get a compliment every time i wear it , love it ! 	Watch
I purchased this watch for my husband several weeks ago , as his watches always needed battery replacements often . My husband and I both like that fact that it 's Eco-Drive , so hopefully it will last a long time . It was pretty easy to set up . We even let it sit under a florescent lamp for a few days just to be sure it would work well . I also took the suggestion from other reviewers and purchased a separate watch strap , as the one that comes with it is a bit bulky and stiff . I bought a Maratac Mil Series NATO 18mm strap in black from -LRB- -LRB- ... -RRB- -RRB- , as per a reviewer 's suggestion because he said it works well when typing on a keyboard all day at work -LRB- the buckle is on the side of the wrist , not the bottom -RRB- . Overall , my husband is really happy with the watch -LRB- and he really likes the replacement strap I bought too -RRB- . 	Watch
In the past , I have n't been much of a watch wearer , but I thought that it was time that it would be more mature to wear one than keep pulling out my cell phone to check the time . I chose this one because of its slick look and slim profile . It was a great choice . It feels really comfortable , keeps time extremely well , the clasp is easy to use , and I 've gotten a number of compliments on it . This watch has effectively made me proud to wear a watch . 	Watch
I always feel naked without a watch around my left wrist . Casio has solved that problem at least , and it does so with a certain style unique to my taste . The features are n't complicated , and I do find them pretty useful . It 's a good watch to have . 	Watch
why go for style when you can have great visible black numbers on a good white face with the Casio - MQ247B2 -LRB- Size : men -RRB- which is less expensive and more readable ? Numbers are nothing to hide . Go for the less expensive watch , considering the price of shipping these days . 	Watch
This is a great watch and priced nicely . Fast shipping and great service overall . Would buy again ! This watch gets alot of attention and lots of compliments ! 	Watch
It does n't come with an installation disk and it was impossible to get it to work on my computer other than with skype . And even when i used it on skype the video quality was just like my camera on my laptop . Waste of money . I got ripped . 	Webcam
This may be a first-rate , brand new camera but the software provided apparently continues to be a long term issue as of 12\/7\/2011 . Have a Dell 435\/9000 with Windows 7 64 bit . Upon attempting install , software shows not compatible . Navigating the solution is not how you will want to spend your life moments . Some day Logitech might get software that prompts updates and auto-fixes . 	Webcam
I spent about a month reading reviews and comparing webcams . For a long time I was convinced that logitech was the best way to go , but I was wrong . This shows much clearer that any logitech on the market , all of which sell for much more that $ 40 . you will not be disappointed . I had the cam for about 2 months now , and have no complaints . I everybody says is the clearest the have seen . 	Webcam
The video is good but not great . The video lost frames at the ntsc frame rate which is about 27 frames per second but seemed to work well at 24 . My first recording took 9 GB of hard drive space for about a six minute video . If I had to do it over again I would get the C910 or C920 which both offer video compression . 	Webcam

This is a very basic webcam and that 's reflected in the price . The good news is that the picture quality is fine -LRB- once you 've refined the focus using the focus ring -RRB- and it easily integrates with windows messenger and Skype . I have it connected above my monitor and it 's small size enables me to forget it 's there while working . There are a couple of negatives , it is n't great in low light and the sound 's not up to much . That 's true of most webcams however and I 'd always recommend purchasing either a headset or a stand alone microphone . Even a very cheap mic will have sound quality better than most webcams . While it 's not perfect it has met my needs and I wo n't replace it until \/ if it breaks . I would recommend it if you 're looking for a budget camera and either do n't mind low quality sound or are willing to spend a few extra dollars on a mic . "	Webcam
I love that this webcam has a built in microphone , it works great in skype and other video chats ! Even in low light : -RRB- 	Webcam
This webcam is very clear and bright . I have recommended it to my friends and family and several of them purchased it . They , also , are very satisfied . 	Webcam
I paid $ 100 for a camera I use at home from a well known computer manufacturer . Logitech clearly better . I use the Logitech at work and take it on the road with me . Less digital squares and better when people move whiles its on . Microphone works fine . Though this camera is pricer than some it 's worth it . I am thinking of giving my other camera to the kids and buying another one . I wish it came with a carring case . 	Webcam
I bought this to use with Skype . It works seamlessly and requires no technical knowledge to install . The picture and sound quality are excellent , far superior to every other web-cam I 've ever seen on a PC or Mac . 	Webcam
The software would n't load - could n't get it to work from the website , the CD , etc. . Read some reviews on boards after I tried and found others had the same problem . Had to return it . 	Webcam
This webcam is everything it was said to be and more . It has very clear and most natural pictures . All of the funtions are great and the software is very good as well . You can take still pictures as well and you can edit all pictures also , ETC. . Best price I have seen from Amazon as well . 	Webcam
Had a hard time with this webcam . I am glad i got it when i did -LRB- only $ 5 -RRB- is not 12mp . the camera did not work and the sound is crappy when people can here you -LRB- most of the time they ca n't -RRB- go spend the extra 20.00 for a better one ! 	Webcam
I work for an Aviation business and we bought three of these to stay in contact with our other locations . They were a breeze to install on XP and on Vista and we love them . We use these with Skype so the quick Windows Messenger button is useless , but that 's what I get for buying Microsoft . Over all I 'm very satisfied with this product and I 'm thinking about buying one for my home . 	Webcam
The webcam I originally got was not working correctly and turning off all my devices . Also the colors were messed up and eventually it just stopped working . I asked for a replacement and it was sent . Same problem . I was told the problem was that it sucked too much power from the USB bus . I do n't know . It 's a nice cheap webcam that was just what I needed . All I need is more power . 	Webcam
all fine the product arrived on time , I am happy with the purchase I can recommend it , thank you very much 	Webcam
We purchased this webcam to communicate with our daughter at college . We really wanted to be able to see her face , not just hear her voice over the phone . It allows us to gauge how she is doing -LRB- and wehn the conversation has gone on too long -RRB- . The installation was easy , though I had to install Skype separately . The video came up great , but the audio did n't install correctly . Rather than set up the mike on the webcam , it stayed with the default built-in mike . I had to manually change the default to the webcam audio . I thought the software installation would have done that for me . The only thing I would like better about this webcam is if I could change the depth of field . It would be nice to be able to open up the field to cover more space . With three of us sitting around the computer to check on our daughter , it gets a little crowded trying to get everyone in the frame . 	Webcam
I purchased the Logitech Webcam for my Apple Mac Pro with OS 10.5.8 because of the promise that it would work well on a Mac , and only had to be plugged in to work . It did . The image is sharp and clear and the self focusing works perfectly . The microphone is sensitive and picks up normal speech flawlessly . I liked the webcam so well that I bought a second one for my PC at home running Ubuntu Linux 10.04 . The experience was the same there . I just plugged it into the USB port and it worked . I only had to change a sound preference to enable the microphone . I would buy another and recommend the webcam to a friend . 	Webcam
Very easy to install . Works well with Skype and has it 's own program as well , though have n't used it . Built-in microphone also works well . Voice quality is very good . Picture quality is also quite good . My only misgiving is that it does n't really attach well to my screen . It 's just sort of propped or lying on top of it and does n't seem very secure . Has n't been a big issue because this is on a desktop computer screen that really is n't moved around much . But somehow I though it would clip on a bit more securely . Overall good though for the money I paid . 	Webcam
Top-of-the-line webcam . Works great ! Only issue is the potential lock-ups on Windows shut down -LRB- logitech software and\/or skype software -RRB- . Also had to change multiple settings on logitech and skype software to stop software from loading at Windows start up -LRB- relatively easy to do -RRB- . However , these negative aspects are inherent to any new piece of hardware\/software these days , so I do n't take them into consideration -- just want to advise . Consider your internet bandwidth limitations with any webcam , especially a great one like this -- high quality video & voice need high bandwidth -LRB- both on your end and on the other person 's end -RRB- .

I had to buy a new webcam because my laptop 's built-in one broke again . As an on-line psychic , I needed a reliable video web-cam and this one is the best I 've used . Great value for the price . 	Webcam
Great product . This webcam works much better -LRB- quality of picture -RRB- then the one built into my dell laptop . It is easy to install . I bought this for my daughter who is studying abroad and i knew that it would keep my wife at ease if she would be able to talk to her and see her often while she is away . I bought it becuase it was rated very high on cnet . 	Webcam
This is a great product . I bought to use with Skype so the grandparents can talk and SEE their grandson . It was easy to set up and use . Great picture . 	Webcam
The reviews are correct , this is an excellent Web cam . I 've used many over the years , and they tend to stink -LRB- though my iSight cam that I bought to go with my Mac works nicely , just not so well on my pc , which this is for -RRB- . The picture is shockingly clear -LRB- though they sharpen it a tad more than I like -RRB- , but still , I 've only once in my life seen a webcam with this good a picture , and that baby was $ 200 and now is no longer made -LRB- vicam , I believe was the brand -RRB- . The auto-low-light feature is cool , and works well , though it tends to overexpose , makes you a bit too white , but still , it works wonders in low-light and bright-lighting both . Set up on Windows XP was easy , and it 's had not problem working with Skype , MSn and Yahoo . Definitely a good camera , and worth the price - I 've bought other web cams in this price range and they generally just are n't that good . Oh , one bad thing , the funky design for mounting this thing on your screen is just , well , bizarre . And there are no instructions . Unless I have it set up wrong , it seems to just kind of balance on the top of your screen , meaning , if you hit it by accident , it falls . Has n't been a big problem yet , it 's just a bit odd . And the cord felt a bit flimsy to me , but time will tell . But really , I 'm quite pleased - the reviews are correct , this is an excellent Web cam . 	Webcam
I got this camera for an older computer running Windows XP . It works great . When buying a camera I recommend you buy the best one your computer will handle . It may cost a little more money , but it is worth it . Check both the system requirements for the camera and your computer 's specifications . 	Webcam
I 've been pleased with this little camera . As a camera it is clear and effective . The face following function might tend to cause viewers to get a bit seasick as it is n't very stable though . Also , the mount is not all it could be . I feel like the camera is sort of sitting on top of my monitor and might fall off at any moment . It has n't yet ... but it does n't feel very steady 	Webcam
Recieved in an appropriate amount of time , easy to set up & used it the same day we got it . 	Webcam
The Logitech Quickpro 9000 is all you would want in a web cam . It works very well with Skype and has the easiest connectivity we have experienced . The desk top control panel gets in the way so we disabled the startup menu option so we can start it when we need it only . Great item to complete our family communication experiences 	Webcam
I thought the product was a very great deal for the price I paid . After installing the software -LRB- which has a lot of extras that you really dont need -RRB- , the camera works very well . I have n't used it for VoIP yet , but just using it as a camera to record , it 's pretty cool ! It zooms in on your face if you chose to ... which is really cool . It follows your face around . It gets 4\/5 because it 's not intuitive as to how to pan and tilt digitally . 	Webcam
this is the desktop model that Google free videoconference uses as a reference\/recommendation . on Oovoo , Skype , and Gmail videoconferencing , i always get compliments as to the picture quality . Microphone is also very good . Compatability with Windows 7 can be tricky sometimes , but i blame the OS for that . as soon as the red circle lights up , i know i 'm good to go . the software has amusing video ` masks ' that can only be used with other Logitech webcam owners . overall highly recommended !

I bought a Logitech 900 -LRB- not from Amazon -RRB- only to discover that it is NOT compatible with a Mac . So I consigned the 9000 to a Windows device , and bought from Amazon a 910 which claims to be Mac compatible . Well , it is , but only barely . You can plug in the too-short USB cable -LRB- a few inches shorter than the 900 cord -RRB- and you will indeed see a picture . The bundled software is Windows-only , but if you look hard enough on the Logitech website you can find and download Mac software . It is a highly truncated version of the Windows software , with no mechanism for face recognition , panning and tilting , zooming , or other features advertised . By the way , the lens is so wide-angle that zooming , even digital zooming , is an essential feature if you want your face to be recognized . No way around it , I feel cheated . Not by Amazon but by Logitech . By the way , the Logitech website is self-consciously `` with it , '' advertising `` how to '' video pages , some of which do not include videos ; worse , some claimed tutorials are merely self-regarding touchy-feely videos of ecstatic Logitech customers , just like you and me only much happier ; with no explanation of how the product works ; how it allegedly works , I mean . Featureless as the Mac version is , the picture is beautiful , and the twin mics -- if you can figure out how to access them -- are excellent . If only the thing were truly Mac compatible , with the features that are advertised and no doubt actually available on the Windows version , I would be very happy . 	Webcam
Bought a total of three Logitech QuickCam Pro 9000 's , one for me and one for each of my two daughters . They were easy to setup . The picture and sound quality are outstanding . We use Skype for our connection and have been very satisfied with the results . 	Webcam
Awesome picture on this little cam . Easy to mount on a flatscreen monitor . Sometimes it is a little difficult to move without falling off though . Installed on Windows 7 64bit flawlessly . Overall there is no better webcam out there that delivers 720p at the pricepoint of under $ 100 . 	Webcam
I bought this cam for the clarity not for the effects , so I would rate this item 5 stars for the video , but because the effects do n't work properly on a windows vista computer ... I 'll just rate it a 4 . If I had Vista Ultimate I hear that the effects work correctly . 	Webcam
I bought this camera for my wife to use while I was out of town for several months . The camera has a great picture about 50 % of the time . For some odd reason the camera seems to want to refocus constantly . Even when the camera is just pointed at a wall it continuously focused and refocused . If I had seen these issues before I left town I probably would have exchanged it for another HD webcam . The mount does not bother us as it is usually just placed on a desk and the base is stiff enough to hold the camera in position . 	Webcam
I purchased the C910 webcam on Friday and found it for $ 49 at Sam 's the following day . I figured that I would return it unopened to Amazon , and let them know their price was not the best . Then I found out they were going to charge me close to $ 10 to return it saying , `` The problem was not their fault . '' Oh , I guess that it 's my fault I found the same product nearby priced 20 % lower ... I was at fault to think I could get the best price from them . They do n't guarantee the best price . Well , I 'll just have to smarten up and purchase items from other than Amazon . Sorry , my fault . 	Webcam
I installed the camera , and it works fine and has a good picture . My biggest gripe is with the software that came with the camera . If you install the camera webcenter software , it will launch repeatedly on its own and start filming and snapping photos automatically . If you uninstall the software and leave the drivers installed , you keep getting an error message from the windows image acquisition software . To get rid of this , you have to uninstall the drivers , which disables the camera . I 'm not sure if my problems are typical , but I find them highly annoying . In this day of privacy concerns , I would have expected Creative not to introduce something that behaves so suspiciously . 	Webcam
The auto focus works better then I thought along with the good picture in low light makes this cam well worth the investment . 	Webcam
For the low price I just knew I would get a pitiful little camera but I was wrong . I installed it on my HP 510 with Windows XP and had no trouble at all . The very first picture was just as clear as it could be . It 's a nice little camera and I 'm pleased with it . 	Webcam
This is a very nice webcam , and does pretty much exactly what it 's supposed to . It 's super easy to use -LRB- just plug into a USB port , and that 's it , did n't have to do anything else , I have Windows Vista 32-bit -RRB- . It gives a clear , accurate image . It also has some nice features , like taking pictures and videos -LRB- but I guess most webcams do that -RRB- . I really like the way it fits on top of your monitor -LRB- I have a flat-panel one -RRB- , just clips on and is sturdy . I also like the color , the silver and black fits my whole pc set up perfectly . I never use the `` Live Call '' button on top of the cam , so i 'm not sure how well that feature works . But overall a very nice , solid webcam , especially given the cheap price . 	Webcam
This item does what it is supposed to . Picture quality is above average . The led light control is inconvenient because it is located on the cord and not the unit which is fine for laptop users but hard to get to for desktop users where the camera is on top of the monitor which will hide the cord . Also , the description states that this webcam has a mic built in , it does not . On the company 's website their description states `` no built in mic '' . I believe this is an Amazon error . Overall , you ca n't go wrong . 	Webcam
Camera worked great ... until Microsoft downloaded the incorrect drivers for some product call SunplusIT Pc Camera ... Now the cam is little more than an overly priced paperweight . You can uninstall the drivers , but the moment you plug the cam in again it downloads the same erroneous drivers . Neither HP nor Microsoft have come forward with a solution . DO N'T WASTE YOUR MONEY ! 	Webcam
"I received the webcam <ahref=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000RZQZM0/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/184-7493237-3671546""> Logitech Webcam Pro 9000 \/ QuickCam Pro 9000 </a> in 2 business days ; on time is normal with Amazon . The camera and software were easy to setup , install and use . I was up and working within 20 minutes . I have used the camera on Skype and Yahoo IM . Skype , so far , has a lot less delay in the sending and receiving of video . I am connected to the internet , both up and down , at 35mbs . I have tested the HD thru Logitech but do n't have any friends with HD capabilities -LRB- I will insure my daughters and grand daughter upgrade -RRB- . I am very satisfied with the audio and video but have only used it with 3 friends . By the way , I run Vista on a AMD dual core 3800 + processor , 4GB RAM and have over 800GB free on my 2 hard discs . I have a Radeon x1300 video card and a 24 '' LCD monitor . "	Webcam
Pros Pro 9000 has Carl Zeiss lens . The image quality , if adjusted , is very nice even in poorly-lit room . This is obviously the most important for webcam . It does everything automatically , but I stop autofocus and adjust the image manually in order to avoid frequent image disturbances by auto-adjustment . I usually adjust only exposure and gain . It captures technically up to 1600x1200 pixel movie , but actually it depends on your PC 's spec . My PC -LRB- XP , Pentium-M 1.4 GHz , 1G RAM -RRB- can capture without any trouble up to 640x480 . Cons You should be cautious when you Skype using this camera . If both your PC and your chat-partner 's PC are powerful enough -LRB- at least above my PC 's spec -RRB- , there will be no problem . Otherwise , your Skype and your OS itself may become unstable and unfunctional in a few minutes . In other words , Pro 9000 is NOT perfectlly compatible with Skype and may cause annoying trouble . -LRB- I also tried Yahoo Messenger and this camera did n't work well on it . -RRB- It is my understanding that this defect at least partially stems from Logitech 's poor driver or software . Plus , there is no shortcut-key in its software , which may disappoint those manually adjust the image . I believe many users are waiting for Logitech 's upgrade of the driver and software immediately . Built-in mic is I think a junk . If you speak near the mic or speak just a little bit loudly , the sound easily cracks . My old cheap mic does n't have such a problem . So , you need to use your mic or headset separately . The stand soundly rests on display but not so on table . Anything else Video effects are fun just once and you 'll never use them again . You need to get rid of the webcam software from startup by yourself . Do n't expect `` High Definition '' video chatting unless you and all your chatting-partners have powerful Core2Duo PC . The optic itself is great . I recommend the webcam if Logitech would listen to users ' voice and improve the driver and software . 	Webcam
Great cam , excellent quality and audio , but it 's too heavy and tips over netbooks and lite notebooks when placed on top of the screen . You have to prop up the netbook with something behind it . Took off one star for this only . 	Webcam
This little video cam is marvelous . There was only one drawback , and it had to do with a curious conflict between the software accompanying the LifeCam and my resident programs . After I cleaned up some unused programs and reinstalled the LifeCam software there has been no problem . In any case , the camera as such works well with clear imagery , good streaming , and it even has an automatic focus\/follow feature ! 	Webcam
I got this so i could video chat through skype with my girlfriend . The video quality was only bad due to internet connections off and on but in general when the internet was fast I never received a complaint about quality . It was very easy to install and extremely easy to use . The best part was the effects i could put on my face such as cowboy hat , afro , etc. . These are all very fun and come in handy when the conversation starts to slow down . I would definitely recommend this to anyone thinking about a webcam . 	Webcam
This product is nothing short of awesome . Great image and lighting correction and excellent audio with echo reduction . Instant identification with Skype on both my PC and Mac ! Super satisfied with this purchase ! 	Webcam
I bought three of these cameras and the audio stopped working a week , the other two shortly . All of them stopped working the microphone . I do not recommend . Do not buy this camera ! 	Webcam
This webcam just wo n't work with Vista . I have searched high and low for a driver for this , but none of them do the trick . And to think I just bought this ! The Logitech I bought several years ago has Vista drivers and works great , and Creative does n't even bother updating the drivers for such a recent product .

Bought a Logitech Fusion and loved the quality of the camera and kids loved the software but had a lot of difficulty with conflicts between the Logitech drivers and my Media Center PC . Then read a number of reviews explaining this problem . Decided to try the Microsoft . Installation was easy but the video is much , much worse than the Fusion . Microsoft claims a true 1.3 MP video -LRB- compared to Fusion 's 640x480 -RRB- but it is very noticeably poorer quality than the Logitech . If only I could get Logitech and Media Center to get along . 	Webcam
This works very well and the software that comes with it is very easy to use . 	Webcam
I purchase this item as a gift . I have as similar web cam the : Logitech Webcam Pro 900 . The C260 while not as sharp an image is very good and worked well with Skype . It took about 30 minutes to load the software and it worked without start up problems . 	Webcam
I ordered this product , really not knowing what to expect . After reading the easy to understand instuctions , I plugged it in and it worked just as easily as I had hoped . Great product for the money !! 	Webcam
This product installed easily and is integrated well into Skype which is the only reason I bought it . It claims to use the High Quality video standard for Skype , but I have found that the picture drops sometimes in the middle of a call and that the quality of the video can really vary from call to call in terms of frame rate . It 's still way better than the Creative brand camera I tried first , so I plan on keeping it . Hopefully some drivers improve stability over time . 	Webcam
what seemed like a wonderful idea - new and advanced . . has turned out to be a thorn in my side - and left me with trying to find a new camera . <p> the good side - is the picture quality is state of the art . <p> that is all . <p> after the first day - the face tracking stopped working . . and now the entire camera wont tilt upwards . for now , its sitting on books . <p> a total waste of money . - i had the first Logitech series cam they had out . . and it worked like a champ - and still does . . however now its too obsolete to work with XP . 	Webcam
Easy set up and solid software , as is usually the case with Logitech . Still need to contact support to adjust and remove the vertical lines -LRB- confident Logitech knows how to do this and I 'll feel as though , I should 've known after they tell me -RRB- , but none-the-less happy with the product .

I bought this for my wife while I was deployed so we could Skype and I could see my daughter . I was tired of the junk camera on her computer and hoped being 720 that this would be better . It was an alright picture , not much of an improvement over her computers camera tho . Still was fairly blocky , chopped picture and was much less impressive than i was hoping for . All in all , for the price I 'd call it a good deal for a starter camera . 	Webcam
I bought this webcam for my daughter and it works great . I was so impressed with the picture quality that I ordered another one for my sister . Highly recommend . 	Webcam
\*\*\*\* I give it a 4 because it looks kinda blurry but its alrite for the price . The shipping was pretty good . it got here really fast . As for the webcam its not the greatest but it good for the price . I also like that its magnetic so you could take it off the clip . : -RRB- I think i will be using this webcam for a while . haha And installing it was super easy you just put in the cd and follow directions .

The camera and microphone work well . Very sharp pictures . Had a few problems setting it up . Ended up uninstalling it , downloading the lastest program , and then reinstalling it . Seems to work fine now . 	Webcam

Arrived as promised . Downloaded latest driver from the website . Absolutely would not install . Troubleshooting suggested MSCONFIG file modifications for a `` clean install '' . NO WAY was I doing that nonsense . Went to Best Buy and bought a MS HD1080 webcam on sale . The MS camera installed and worked within 10 minutes . True plug and play ... . beautiful picture and sound . When will Logitech update their Windows 7 drivers ? ... ... Nice camera but would not work !!!!!! If they come out with an upgrade I may try to re-install in a couple of months . I had to manually uninstall the driver software as well ... NOT WIN 7 compatible yet ... ... 	Webcam

I BOUGHT THIS WEBCAM SO I CAN TALK TO MY FREINDS . I ORDERED IT ON THE 12TH OF LAST MONTH AND I NEVER GOT IT . SO FAR I 'M NOT HAPPY WITH THE MAKER OF THIS PRODUCT . IM A FIRST TIME BUYER WITH THIS COMPANY SO FAR THE FIRTS IMPRESSION WAS N'T A GOOD ONE . ALSO I FOUND OUT THAT THE CAM WAS RETURNED TO THE SELLER . AT LEAST I GOT A RE-FUND . BUT IF I WERE TO BUY THIS CAM AGAIN IT WOULD BE FROM SOME ONE ELS . 	Webcam
I am very pleased with this product , and would recommend it , it has been very handy to be able to communicate with our family out of state . Thank you . 	Webcam
I feel similar to the gentleman above . I am separated from my wife and 2 year old son due to work . I bought us each a camera . Mine is a fixed Logitech , and I brought the new Titanium home with me at Christmas for her . Well , I tried it on our 2.2 GHz Pentium 4 laptop and was shocked at lack of video quality . So I bought her a brand new dual core 3.0 GHz pentium with 2 gig of ram -LRB- my computer here is a 2.8 P4 with 1.0 gig of ram -RRB- . Anyhow , the network conditions seem to be the deciding factor . Both computers are through cable modem , so they are fast . The whole process is at best , disappointing . We tried going through Yahoo -- much worse than Sight Speed . I would even be willing to pay for Sight Speed if they guaranteed better video quality . It freezes alot , the audio seems to lag . If you want to leave video messages , then no problem . As far as actual video conferencing , we end up talking on our cell phones -LRB- my wife on speaker so my son can hear -RRB- and just using the video . Would I attempt to set up video conferencing again ? Not until there is an improvement in data transfer . This review is n't so much about the camera as it is video conferencing . If I had a read a review that would have said , `` In my opinion , I would wait for technology to advance before wasting the money , '' I may have reconsidered . I just wanted my son to see me everyday and tell him goodnight . The camera is n't any better than the $ 80 logitech , but it was n't worth the time or money to send this one back to save $ 20 . 	Webcam
Works as described . Really was plug and go on my Mac . Picture quality was as good as advertised . Sound quality is there also . Worked as easy as I hoped with iMovie . 	Webcam
The camera offers GREAT quality . As i 'd seen from research , it 's not capable of HD on Skype , but it comes with some of it 's own software for HD conversations ... not very convenient if you ask me . I dont see myself convincing all my friends to go buy logitech webcams , and download the software so we can chat once in a while . As some other webcams i 've had , it comes with some visual effects stuff , but they 're kinda stupid . I REALLY wish someone would just come up with a free , windows version of Photobooth -LRB- the mac thing -RRB- but whatever . I got on a few cam chat sites just to see how it worked online , and apparently it 's pretty good . if you 're recording video at 720p -LRB- it 's max -RRB- fast movements are a bit blurry , but in general the framerate is fine . overall , i 'm happy i bought it . and the microphone works great too . Just thought i 'd mention that . There 's an options menu that auto-adjusts it . i just talked at it for a few minutes , and watched it adjust until it seemed to stop . I recorded some audio , and it 's flawless . Cord is fairly long too , which is nice . I have it mounted on my LCD monitor atop my desk , while my computer is on the ground at least 3 feet away ... plenty of cord to spare . if your USB port is more than 3.5 feet away from where you want to mount it , i 'd consider getting a USB extension cable , or hub to plug it into .

The camera quickly installs to your machine and is up and running in no time . With great features such as face tracking , bright light technology and intuitive features this camera is sure to make you proud . 	Webcam
it was a good busines i feel good with my webcams , it is a so good product what i needed . 	Webcam
This has been a great tool to use ... easy hook up even for a non-techie like me . Highly recommended ! 	Webcam
I was horribly disappointed by the unit I received . It is obvious from my experience that many of the units have defective cameras . That is the only way I can explain my experience as compared to many of the positive reviews and actual videos I have seen on the net of this item . The sound is absolutely phenomenal . There is nothing more to say about the sound quality than that . The video of the unit I received looked like an 8 bit pixilated , slow , grainy experience form the '80s . I immediately contacted blue mic with a service request for a defective unit . It is truly unfortunate that the video was so bad because I really liked the design of it . It was very easy to set up and it sat on my LCD monitor very nicely . The fact that it was designed not to require drivers is nice . It was immediately recognized by my Mac Mini 2011 . The bottom line is that everything abut the unit was excellent except for the video , but this is supposed to be a webcam , hmm . If blue mic can provide me with a quality replacement I will most certainly be using it and I will modify this review to reflect what happens with the service request . Another thing to take into account is that the price was really nice . I could n't find another camera that offered the design or features of this item for $ 22 and change . I hope this all gets resolved . 	Webcam
Incredibly good for any Mac device ! Have gotten 6 so far an have no complaints , the hd is amazing as well as the response rate . From casual use to business use . 	Webcam
Bought these for my daughter and myself when she moved out of state . Excellent ! The sound quality is great and the picture is good . We use them quite a bit and they are great for when you 're lonely to see that familiar face . Highly recommended ! 	Webcam
I got this camera to skype with my family . It works fine . I had a little problems with the picture quality at the beginning , but then I found out all I had to do was focus it manually . Now it works great . 	Webcam

The camera gets the job done for a basic video transfer . However , it is lacking a lot of things a pricier webcam has . I did n't realize most of them until I got a new laptop with a webcam built in . This webcam has a very narrow field of view . You need to get it pretty far from you to show anything other than your face . It does not adjust well to light at all . It ca n't catch anything in a dim room . The clip on it is n't a clip at all . It does have a soft pad on the square ring that creates enough friction to hang onto a laptop , but it 's not a clip . You move the laptop and it will fall off . The camera does have adjustable angles , it can pivot on it 's mount . The cable is sufficiently long . The mic leaves a lot to be desired . do n't plan on depending on it . At the end of the day , it 's $ 5 . And really does get the job done . It does VERY well for the money . 	Webcam
Great cam for the money ! I almost didnt buy it after all the reviews on here ... glad i did ! The cam AND the software work FINE w my copy of windows 7 64-bit ! Someone else said it wont work w more than 3 gigs of RAM ... horsedroppings ! I have 8 gigs of RAM runs without a hitch ! The cam uses thirty percent of resources while recording in 720p with a few internet windows open at the same time . Ya the cam refocuses too much - so what ?!? At least it friggin HAS an autofocus ! 	Webcam
This camera has changed my perspective on grainy webcams . I have never had a poor video quality problem with this product . I enjoy using it to communicate with friends\/family around the world . Image wise , it compares to most pocket cams on the market . Audio wise , its crisp and clear , and it picks up the slightest noises . It captures the audible fans on my computer case , which is located 4 feet away under the desk ! I have a windows 7 64 bit ultimate OS and it runs fine . Prior to my upgrade , I had vista 64 and it was plug and play as well . This is definitely a great investment for someone who enjoys keeping in touch with people \/ uses conferencing software for business . It 's small and well built . 	Webcam
I expected less than what I received . It is awesome . A little of issues in the auto-focus , but everything else works great . 	Webcam
There are others out there that are more expensive and do n't do more . It is easy to set up and use . 	Webcam
It works great but is a little hard to mount on my computer . The software has lots of modifications for pictures that makes it fun to play with as well : - -RRB- 	Webcam
The camera has been great for our use . We mainly use with Skype , but has worked great for MS chat also . I was able to allow plug and play to detect the device and used default drivers without issues . I 'm using Windows XP at home and Windows 7-64bit on laptop with no problems . Visually , far superior to our 10 year old camera and have been very happy with it for past couple months . 	Webcam
I 'm very happy with the Logitech Pro9000 webcam that I got it was very easy to install and to use , , , , I have talked my daughter , son-in-law and my grandson , , , the main reason I got it , , , very good product . 	Webcam
Real nice inexpensive digital camera & video camera . You will need a towel or hood when using in bright sunlite , I think this is true for most digital cameras . When I break this one I 'll probably get another just like it . 	Webcam

Not much to add to previous reviews . It just seems unusual that a product comes out of the box with clear instructions on how to install , the installation works flawlessly , and the product works as advertised . First PC accessory in many years that did n't need some tweaking to make it work the way it was supposed to work . Good for you , Logitech ! And good service from Amazon . Very pleased . 	Webcam
I bought two of these for Christmas this year for my kids and their computers . I 've personally been using the Logitech QuickCam at home for 3 years now on `` my '' computer and thought it was pretty good until I put it side-by-side with the Creative Labs product . <p> The quality of the image is hugely superior . I mean , saying it 's just better or even exceptional is an understatement - it 's really THAT good . Installation was a no-brainer , without a single hiccup . The three-pronged stand - yeah , that 's a little funky but it 's nothing to lose any sleep over . Your objective with this product should be a quality image and fundamental ease of use , which this camera effortlessly provides - however , yes , the stand could be a wee bit less `` rickety '' but it 's really not that bad ! <p> It does `` ghost '' a bit - but what I found out was that it was my kids on the other end of the camera moving around at warp speed - not necessarily the camera itself . Nice clear images , vibrant color . It 's a nice toy to have on your PC . <p> It 's well priced for what you get . I 'm ordering my third one today - so long Logitech ! <p> Happy Cammin ' ! 	Webcam
Bought this for the grandparents -- it works well & set up without any hassles on an older computer . I would recommend it without any qualms . 	Webcam
never worked . would not focus . Had family and friends check it out to make sure it was n't `` just operator error . 	Webcam
This has better quality than any of the ones my friends use !! Whenever I look at the video quality of the ones my friends use , their 's is so much darker and grainier than mine . I just plug and voila , it works . I did not have to install drivers or anything . The video quality is great and it shows mer very well , even when I am in the darkness !!! SUPER !!! 	Webcam
I 've had this for an entire summer and use it for a variety of purposes , video conference , having fun with the microphone with friends , talking to people and such and it does its purpose . The resolution is greater than any webcam I 've ever seen or used and the thing is very durable -LRB- I 've knocked it down at least thirty times , no exaggeration , and my cat has done so at least a dozen times , it falling down , smacking into my computer then falling into the dark -RRB- and yet it is still as good as new . The 1.3 megapixel resolution is great , the webcam can look like a real professional camera like one that you 'd pay $ 100-250 for , that is , if you can get the right lighting . It is sort of picky on lighting , I find that it does work perfectly fine and still look better than all the webcams I 've seen if it has low light but it is still grainy and such and is sort of annoying , to get the best quality I have to light myself up completely and such and it can be an annoying process but not THAT annoying . It has a 6 feet cord which is useful for mobility and it has zoom , though , albeit , I never use the zoom often it is there if you want\/need it . You can easily focus it in on things and close up or far away if focused correctly you can see extremely fine , precise , and great detail . There are a number of things you can adjust on it , too , which makes it a good buy . All in all , I like Microsoft , good company , great webcam , the current price its at -LRB- at the time of this review -RRB- is $ 42 , that is a lot more acceptable then the $ 75 I spent on this thing , it 's not worth that much ! A little overpriced , sometimes I wonder if the Logitech Quickcam would be better since I have great experience with Logitech , but , that 's for you to decide ! Pros : Good quality Good effects Great pictures in right lighting Takes videos and audio , audio can be taken alone without video which is a bonus Pictures can be taken and enhanced to 5.0 megapixels Good resolutions Bad : Price is a bit too high Higher resolutions -LRB- like the 1.3 megapixel resolution -RRB- can be REALLY laggy on the computer , and such anything past 800x600 I find very laggy . Has low light but requires a lot of light for photos that are n't grainy at all and actually look like a real high quality photo . All-in-All , I give the Microsoft Lifecam VX-6000 4 stars out of 5 . Choose between Logitech and Microsoft , they 're both great , I do n't think you 'll regret your purchase , I DO recommend the Microsoft Lifecam VX-6000 , but , you should be wary of the things I said : -RRB- . 	Webcam
I rarely write reviews , but this one I 'm compelled to . Seems like it 's a good camera , and their useless mac software aside , here 's one thing they do n't tell you . The autofocus does n't work properly on a mac . If you move more than a foot -LRB- lean back in your chair -RRB- , you 're now all of a sudden blurry , if you return to where you were , you 're still blurry . Very frustrating to people you 're ichatting or skyping with . Would not recommend . 	Webcam
We liked this product so much we bought 2 more . It gives a very clear picture and has many excellent features . The Zeiss lens was a major reason we bought this webcam . The Logitech HD Pro Webcam C910 is easy to setup and works well with gmail video chat . 	Webcam
I did n't have too many installation issues , but this thing just died after a few months . I held the reset button for minutes and it would n't reset . I wo n't be buying D-Link products in the future , I expect alot more out of something I paid $ 100 for . 	Wireless Router
I replaced my Linksys -LRB- turns out unnecessarily -RRB- with the d-link . Both were working OK as wireless routers . Linksys was easier to set up with their web-based configuration service . d-link slipped Network Magic into their `` installation procedure '' . While I really like Network Magic , now that I 'm using it , I felt that d-link `` conned me '' into spending the extra money for Network Magic . The d-Link web-based configuration is not for the inexperienced -LRB- unless you just use all defaults -RRB- . On the other hand , it is so extensive that an expert tecchie could have lots of fun tweaking the d-link config to precisely what they want . I believe d-link has a more sophisticated set of configuration parameters . Good for experts , bad for novices , and \* very bad \* for expert wannabees . 	Wireless Router
02\/02\/2012 UPDATE : I disabled the 5 GHz transmitter . Because both of our -LRB- essentially -RRB- new Lenovo laptops only use the 2.4 GHz frequency , there is NO difference in throughput . NOTICE : Before I begin my review , I want to state I have serious doubts about this Netgear WNDR3700v2 router . I bought this WNDR3700v2 last year and never had the chance to install it until now . AFTER I bought it , I have read too many reviews where customers are saying the unit does well at first . After 3-6 months the WNDR3700v2 starts to lose range and then burns out . It appears the transmitters get hot and then burn out . If this happens , I will delete this review and write a negative one . MY REVIEW : I did n't want this Netgear WNDR3700v2 wireless router broadcasting in my bedroom where my cable modem is located . I bought 2 - 50 foot CAT5E cables from MonoPrice and installed the router on a wall in the next room . I think it 's safer that way . I installed the WNDR3700v2 up high on the wall so it would have better range and it would not fall over . I did not use the included stand . Aside from the cable placement problems , setup was easy . I set everything up including both the 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz SSID 's , password and WPA2 encryption type using the Setup Wizard on the CD . I then accessed the router using my browser and changed the hardware router password . I also upgraded the firmware to the latest version 1.0.0.12 using Netgear 's file I had previous downloaded . The upgrade was done through the Ethernet cable on my main desktop system . Everything went smoothly , except I waited a LONG time to install the router . I had grave doubts as to its range and durability . However , everything seems to be running well right now . Amazingly , wireless throughput is just as fast as my Ethernet connection at 6,499 kbps !!! That is really incredible ! I never would have believed a wireless connection could be so FAST !!! Because I do not use the 5 GHz frequency , I plan to disable it through the router browser access menu . I read the router will run cooler without the second 5 GHz transmitter running . I just hope this Netgear WNDR3700v2 router lasts at least 3 years the way it 's supposed to . See my pic 's in the pic 's section for this product . 	Wireless Router
I 've had this only two days but it seems to be working great . Very easy to set up -LRB- about 15 minutes -RRB- and now my wifi connection to my iPod is 4 times faster than with my old Linksys router . And no more dropouts . To make the setup even easier , I just used my old name and password from the Linksys router . This looks like a winner and I would highly recommend it . 	Wireless Router
I had two prerequisites when buying a router : first , it had to be g-type compatible and second , it had to be very simple to install . I was buying it for my mother who is n't very computer literate . To make it more of a challenge I live 1200 miles away from her so she was gonna have to install it with only a little telephone guidance from me . This appeared to suit the bill perfectly and I was n't at all disappointed . It did n't even take a reboot , just plug the supplied thumb drive into a USB port , connect two cables , plug it in and two double-clicks of the mouse later she was wireless . As close to plug and play as it could possibly be . Sent a great signal to her laptop too ; she took it to the opposite side of the house , 40 or 50 feet away and we proceeded to Skype with crystal clear video . This was easily the best $ 50 bucks I 've spent in a very long time . I highly , highly recommend this router . 	Wireless Router
After I installed the wireless router , it was super fast and surfing was so easy . The router was installed on 1st floor and 2nd floor had very good signal too . I will recommend it to my friends . 	Wireless Router
This product is unreliable and it is incompatible with other D-Link products . I had high hopes for it , but found it would restart constantly when there was any significant traffic going through it . Moreover , when I tried to run it in `` Pre-N '' mode with an AppleTV , I was unable to get it to connect at anything higher than 54Mbps and would not work at all with another D-Link product -LRB- Wireless Game adapter -RRB- that only supported `` G '' mode . I was also very concerned about the longevity of the product because it runs very hot . I spent numerous hours on hold with D-Link tech support and ultimately switched back to my old , reliable Linksys WRT-54G and added a Gig-E switch to connect my fastest wired devices . Unfortunately I went past 30 days trying to get the DIR-655 to work reliably and the return period expired . 	Wireless Router
Found that the DIR-655 is very difficult to configure when using HughesNet satellite internet . Problem being that the router wants to confirm that you have an internet connection before allowing you to configure the router . The major problem is that HughesNet modems operate at 192.168.0.1 and the DIR-655 come configured at 192.168.0.1 . Thus you have figure out how to change the IP address of the DIR-655 before you can get it to configure ... and that takes some work . D-Link should make it very easy to change the IP address before configuring !!! 	Wireless Router
Ok ... . Let me start by saying that home networking is bane of my existence . I must live in some sort of black hole as I have been through several different routers in attempts to have my wireless network up to the standard I believe it should be . The set up for this product was a breeze . Real piece of cake . Surprisingly , everything seems to work well . My 2 XBoxs , Ipod , Iphone , Ipad are all catching a nice strong signal . No drops ... The only problem I have had so far is my Apple TV which was operating on the 5.0 Ghz signal . It did drop -LRB- just once -RRB- . Now I have only been using this for a few days so this is a very early review . My B + could grow to an A if things stay on course . I 'm hopeful !!! 	Wireless Router
Easiest router I have ever setup . It 's fast , easy to change settings , automatically sets up the latest security features . This is about my 5th Netgear router ... all were good ... this is the best . 	Wireless Router
My brother loves this router . The wireless is very convenient for use of the PlayStation 3 on line games with friends and solo . 	Wireless Router
I previously had a Linksys WRT54G and was moderately satisfied with it until it started exhibiting signs of ` cheapness ' , like general flakiness , inability to load the web management -LRB- it 'd load a blank screen -RRB- , etc. . After getting frustrated enough , and desiring a router with gigabit ports , I started searching , until I came across the DIR-655 . The first best part -LRB- and there 's more than one -RRB- of this router was unpacking it . Honestly , it 's the sexiest networking device I 've seen in a long while . There 's a button hiding stealthily on the right side , if you take note , but no mention is made of it in the manual . Also included in the package is a little black plastic stand , so you can stand the router on end - that 's pretty standard for D-Link , and I like that . They threw in a Cat-5 cable , was that a joke ? What am I going to do with a Cat-5 cable on a gigabit router ? That 's very amusing . I elected not to run the software included on the CD . There 's no real need if you know what you 're doing . However , for more advanced users I 'd recommend connecting the router to your computer , but NOT connecting to your internet connection -LRB- cable modem -RRB- , and just spending a few minutes familiarizing yourself with your new sweet toy and all of her options . Now for the good stuff : This router is amazing ! The main ` Setup ' page is basically divided into 2 parts for each section , a ` wizard ' for quick-and-easy setup , and a ` manual ' page . Basically , if you 're a beginner , stick to the wizard pages . If you wanna get up and running fast , go through the wizards , you can always go back later and manually tweak the settings to your liking . Connectivity is top level . I tested it by transferring 25 GB of large files then 25GB of small files between two hosts connected to this router , both using 10 feet of cat6 each . 100 % success , no packets lost , no fragmentation , and the transfer was about 4 % faster than the same transfer straight through on an unmanaged gigabit switch . Internet connectivity was great too . Thanks to the built-in SPI firewall , all the ` network noise ' -LRB- thanks to all the other ` dirty ' hosts on comcast 's network -RRB- is effectively eliminated , and honestly speeds up my internet activity significantly over what I 'm used to when using the WRT54G . Checking the logs revealed the dirty details of all this crap that 's filtered out , and I like it gone . Wireless-N connectivity was also good . Not much can be said here , it works like it should , and I have no complaints . Administration is also very nice . As usual , the router is administered via browser , and while that 's cool , I 'd also like to be able to ssh into it and take care of business via CLI , but alas that is not to be . But otherwise , the web management is well designed , fast and easy to understand . This router also checks periodically for firmware updates and notifies you via email if you have the email settings enabled . Other items of note : VoIP works flawlessly , as does all online gaming that I tried . Latency is noticeably reduced -LRB- on my favorite server , from about 80ms to about 60ms avg -RRB- in Half-Life 2 deathmatch . torrents worked fine . So far I have no real complaints about this router . It 's now my most favorite part of my network . Overall , I give this 5\/5 . Honestly , I 'd easily say it 's worth the price I paid for it -LRB- at the time it was $ 140 -RRB- , and for my network it is a perfect match . If you 're a ` normal ' computer user , do n't buy this just to impress your friends ; the features and complexity would be lost on you and are not worth the price . PROS : - DHCP Address Reservation - Easy administration - Quick Setup - Email logs - Incredibly easy port forwarding and per-application settings - SPI + NAT + WPA2 . Nuff said . - Great documentation and help files . - Port forwarding scheduling . CONS : - No SSH or CLI administration . - Reboot required after changing most settings . - No matching high quality D-Link cable modem to go with this . Congratulations , D-Link , on crafting yet another incredible piece of networking equipment . The DIR-655 is worthy enough to sit on my desk , instead of crammed behind it like the Linksys was !

This product is great with alot of features : Cons : - the setup is alittle stubborn with saving the settings and updating in real time as fast I would want . - Seems like the router needed or wanted to be setup by the cd that came with it - The ftp login only give you two logins - Admin and Guest - wish there was optional logins and more settings - Wish it had print server option Pros : - So many features for a great price - Supports Ftp\/Http internal\/external file sharing - File sharing format supported by most streaming networking devices - Has multiple access points for network for personal use and guest - separate one for wireless G\/N\/B network 2.4 ghz and one for 5ghz for both SSIDS - Easy to setup access for file sharing - Traffic meter is a plus especially for isp like comcast and their bandwidth limitations keeps the nasty letter being sent to you - Wireless is fast dependable and great range ! Worth every penny 	Wireless Router
Upgrade my D-Link DIR-628 N Router to this . The D-Link was crap , constant dropped connections and the need for reset all the time , and their `` SecureSpot -LRB- tm -RRB- '' technology was seriously embedded , unremoveable spyware . This router is leagues ahead . I 've purchased Netgear in the past and do n't know why I did n't just stick with them . It 's a good looking router , the reboot time is very fast . On a power cycle -LRB- off\/on -RRB- it boots all of the way up in about 30 seconds . The range is ridiculous , I live in an apartment complex , most of which is now covered by this beast 's WiFi signal . The 10\/100\/1000 Wired connection is also amazing along with the 300Mbps wireless N connection , I can transfer large files on the inside of my own network very quickly without the need for USB drives , and all of my devices can stream content with relative ease . The default firmware is probably my only real complaint . It 's more than enough for people who just need a day-to-day router and do n't attempt to way over-control their technology , but it is very helpful that it allows you to install the Tomato Firmware to it . If you 're a tech-savy person I would highly recommend switching to it . 	Wireless Router
I 'm fairly new to wireless routers and I bought this to replace a Linksys that I have had problems with since I bought it . After talking with my internet provider and researching his recommendationas as well as other routers , I bought this D-Link and could n't be more happier ! The set up took about 10 minutes . The set up CD has clear and easy to follow instructions . The speed is amazing . I highly recommend this router to everyone and will . 	Wireless Router
This device works OK , it has reception problems in parts of my home . I would look at another one that gets better reception than this unit . 	Wireless Router
I bought this router not quite one year ago and am already shopping for it 's replacement . It worked reasonably well for a while , although it frequently was barely able to keep up when I tried to stream movies , which was a big part of the reason I went to a faster router in the first place . The hard drive I had attached to the USB port was sometimes accessible , sometimes not . Range was comparable to , or possibly slightly worse than the old Linksys router I had been using for years . And finally , in early June , this router stopped broadcasting an internet signal . The internal network still functioned , but it would not pass through the internet signal from the cable modem . I thought it might possibly be the modem or ISP until I hooked the old trusty Linksys back up to it and it worked fine . And now , Netgear has deleted their customer service number from their website . I would too if I was selling garbage like this . I will be going back to a Cisco-Linksys product going forward . This piece of junk ... well , I 'll probably paint a bullseye on it and take to the range . It might be good for that . 	Wireless Router
I have only had this router a week but so far I am a happy camper . No dropped signals and no need to reset . I am not a computer geek , just a regular user . The installation was incredibly easy following the 5 simple steps in the one page installation guide . It was up and running in ten minutes . Previously the wireless signal in my wife 's studio which is in a separate building outside the house was about 1 bar out of five . It now is 3-5 bars . And the wireless signal inside the house is robust , even through the walls . I had a configuration question which I submitted via e-mail and got an answer in under a day . 	Wireless Router
Does what it should , wish everything I bought did this . Owned for 2.5 months and never had to reset yet . 	Wireless Router
I love this router and all of its features . However , be careful if you have an iPhone 3GS - Netgear and Apple are not working well together on that device . My iPhone 3GS always has an EXTREMELY slow WiFi connection on WNDR3700 , with bandwidth consistently under 300 kbps . My old iPhone 3G however always reaches more than tenfold speeds on the same router . Because of an unrelated hardware problem on the new iPhone I tried many things , even resetting the network settings , restoring the phone from backup and setting it up as new , and none of these steps fixed the slow wireless access problem . Ultimately , Apple replaced my 3GS because of a touchscreen failure and the replacement unit still has the same exact issue . In addition , I had the same exact problem between the iPhone 3GS and my old Netgear WPN824v3 router . Consequentially , when I 'm at home I just disable my iPhone 's WiFi because it 's much faster on 3G . There are some posts online from people with similar troubles and their fix was to set the Fragmentation Length to 2304 -LRB- or 1024 -RRB- and CTS\/RTS Threshold to 2305 -LRB- or 1500 -RRB- under Netgear 's advanced wireless settings . Some people also suggested changing the channel to 11 -LRB- I 'm unaware of their affiliation with the Spinal Tap band -RRB- . Although some users reported great results after applying some or all of these changes , I systematically applied all of the recommended settings in different possible combinations on both my Netgear routers without any significant improvement in WiFi performance of my iPhone 3GS . The only way to resolve this on my old WPN824v3 Netgear is to disable g mode and stick to b only . However , WNDR3700 does n't offer an option to disable g and n and use the router in a b-only mode . Netgear tech support was n't helpful at all , stating that since my router works with other WiFi devices -LRB- laptops and PS3 -RRB- that I should call Apple , in spite of my positive experience with its performance with other wireless routers -LRB- Cisco wireless at work and Linksys at my sisters where its bandwidth consistently reaches above 10 Mbps and works just fine -RRB- . Since both Netgear and Apple keep playing the finger-pointing game , I feel betrayed by both . My recommendation is to stay away from Netgear wireless gear if you already own an iPhone 3GS , or to stay away from buying an iPhone 3GS if you already own this router -LRB- iPad might have similar problems as I 've seen some early reports about WiFi issues -RRB- . Other than that : Pros : - Dual radios , configurable for separate home and guest SSIDs on each band -LRB- a\/n on 5 GHz and b\/g\/n on 2.4 GHz -RRB- - Guest SSIDs can be configured either for internet-only or with access to the entire home network - USB storage port can use an external HDD or a flash drive for home network storage without much trouble . - USB is configurable for internal and optional external http and ftp access in addition to standard Microsoft Networks share -LRB- for that one you need to set up your Netgear router , laptops and desktops to the same network\/workgroup name in order to see the storage on your local network -RRB- . Cons\/suggestions to Netgear for improvement : - Inability to run 802.11 b only - Inability to change beacon interval settings - Shared USB storage ca n't have more than two accounts - admin and guest . Admin is stuck with the same password as on your router 's admin account and guest with no password . I expected more granular storage space administration capabilities - Problems with iPhone 3Gs 	Wireless Router
This will be the last Netgear product I buy . It slowed my internet speed to 50 to 80 % of the speed coming from my modem . It took them 5 months to troubleshoot and determine it was defective . Then , they refused to honor ` lifetime ' hardware warranty without charging me almost $ 20 in fees . I will use that $ 20 toward another brand of router . The thick accents of the tech support staff made them unintelligible and they were painfully slow and incompetent . 	Wireless Router
I 've had this for about 3 months now and I 've been astounded by the performance and range of this wireless router . Having a compatible N series receiver makes a big difference , but even with b & g , the speed has been really , really impressive . 	Wireless Router
I reviewed all the latest routers and concluded that there was n't one that stood out remarkably as the best . After some consideration , I went with the Netgear WNDR4500 . It is doing a great job with distance and speed and I am very satisfied with the results . It 's pricey but you know how it goes , I want this to last a few years , so the higher cost is acceptable to me . 	Wireless Router
I purchased this router as a replacement for a Linksys -LRB- Cisco -RRB- WRT400N Dual Band router . The installation was straight-forward , with no complications . Dual-bands work simultaneously and both offer good range and speed . Wireless connections to the router stay solid throughout my house and the speed stays consistent , which is better than the Linksys performed . Has standard security features that work well , although I had to change my access key since this router does not allow special characters -LRB- # , ! , etc. -RRB- to be part of the key . This meant that I had to change the key on all my laptops and printers . A small pain , but an easy fix . Admin GUI is plain but easy to navigate . Has a setting to check for firmware updates each time you log in and the installation of any update is handled by the router . The router is designed to be a desktop unit and has no mounting holes , so I had to rig a bracket to mount it where I wanted it . USB port works well , but connecting to the USB device is not intuitive . I do not use a USB device often , so I have to research how to connect when I want to use one . Overall , I would recommend this router . 	Wireless Router
The setup program for this product totally failed . Before you can do any configuration , it asks for the administrator password , which is n't included in the package . It does n't ask for a new password during startup , as is implied by the paper instructions . There 's not really much help on their website . I 'm pretty experienced with network equipment but it aggravated me immediately that such a basic thing did n't work so I did n't want to keep fighting with it . I 'm returning it -LRB- and I almost never return anything -RRB- . 	Wireless Router
This is a great router . Very stable coennection and good range . Easy to set up and get working and have never had a problem connecting devices to it . Works very well with WPA security . 	Wireless Router
I was really excited to finally get an N router , an upgrade from my Linksys wireless G WRT54G2 . First thing I tested was the speed , and I have to say it was abysmal . On a wired connection with my linksys , speedtest.net rated my home pc with a connection of up to 25mbps connection and wireless speeds around 15 mbps . Hooked up to the D-Link extreme N , connected speed dropped to 18mbps and wireless down to 8mbps . AND THIS ONE IS EXTREME . At first I dealt with this as 18mbps was still REALLY fast . The next day , I turned on my laptop and it connected to the network , but no internet connection . I had read in other reviews that it dropped their internet connection every couple of days so at the first sign of this happening to me , I got an RMA and shipped it back . SAVE YOUR MONEY . Go with another brand , I know if I ever bight the bullet for another N router , it will be a linksys . 	Wireless Router
The D-Link DIR-655 Extreme N Wireless Router works fine as a 802.11 n wireless router . However , the reason I bought it was to wirelessly share my printer between two Macs using the USB Shareport on the router . Shareport is not compatible with Mac OS . After hours of searching the internet , I was disappointed to find that D-Link does not provide support for Mac OS 10 . I bought this in combination with a D-Link DWA-140 Wireless USB Adapter . D-Link does not provide Mac support for the adapter , however I was able to find a free third-party driver that is compatible . The best solution for sharing a printer is to use an Apple Airport Express or Apple Airport Extreme . I returned both D-Link products and purchased an Airport Express . It was running in a couple minutes , and very easy to wirelessly share my printer . 	Wireless Router
Bought this router about a month ago to replace an old LinkSys unit . I use it primarily for Ethernet connections to several computers and one wireless connection to a laptop . No problems with any of those connections . The laptop is one floor vertically and about 20 feet horizontally away from the router . The ability to connect an external hard drive to the router is a nice feature when backing up from my various computers . I am a novice at this stuff but it was extremely easy to set the router up . The wireless portion has a `` guest '' setting that allows visitors to access the internet but not your network . So far the router has worked well . My only complaint to date is that it dropped the security settings once and I am not sure why ; do n't know if it was something that I did or if it was a malfunction of the router . 	Wireless Router
I purchased this item on Amazon -LRB- got it very quickly -RRB- . This was exactly what I was looking for after reading an online review -LRB- Ecoustics.com -RRB- of the Zyxel MWR211 portable router . I love that it turns my Verizon mobile broadband card into a MIFI\/personal hotspot . This has helped me countless times while stuck at airports allowing me to take full advantage of my WIFI-only Samsung Galaxy Tab tablet computer . For example , I was at Chicago 's O'Hare airport last month and my flight was delayed . The MWR211 allowed me to fire up my Samsung Galaxy Tab and download a few movies in time for my flight . I was able to enjoy both movies during my 3.5 hour flight . In Mexico City , I was able to catch the MWR211 's WIFI signal via my ROKU streamer that was hooked to the hotel room 's TV and was able to watch Netflix seamlessly . In Lake Havasu , the house that we stayed at had no internet nor any satellite - or cable TV and again , the MWR211 coupled with my Verizon mobile broadband card saved the day . We were able to download movies on Amazon VOD and watch HULU Plus . Furthermore , the kids were able to download apps on their various tablets and mobile media players . Another plus is that if you are in a hotel room with a free -LRB- ethernet -RRB- internet connection , the MWR211 will also create a WIFI hotspot from that wired connection so that you can use multiple wireless devices within your hotel room . Setup is very straight-forward -LRB- it 's as easy as setting up a home WIFI router -RRB- and the manufacturer provides a list of mobile broadband devices that are compatible with the MWR211 . I like that it automatically logs-in my Verizon broadband card for me without having to start up the Verizon software and having to manually connect . Also , I did not have to install any software on my laptop . Battery life is rated at 2 hours which is fine for me since I 'm usually plugged in somewhere and I do n't surf all that long while waiting for a flight . Overall , the MWR211 very easily provides a MIFI experience while on the go . I highly recommend this product . 	Wireless Router
I ordered this because I previously owned an earlier model DIR-655 . I had given that one to a friend and upgraded to an apple airport extreme . That lasted about 11 months then died . That put me back in the market for another router . I use this and all the other routers with 3 Dlink DWL-G820 jumps . That created a problem when trying to use them with this router with the older DWL-G820 's . The Security for the jumps used TKIP only , not AES . I also checked and made sure the jumps had the latest firmware . This router had the capability of using either but when using newer hardware such as my Sony laptop -LRB- N -RRB- , Dell laptop -LRB- N -RRB- , Imac wireless , Ipad , Iphone , HP wireless printer , 5 IP cams and a wireless Samsung DVD player , oh and the direct tv DVR , using the TKIP only this router would stop transmitting everyday and sometimes twice a day . I called DLink tech non-support with no help . I also replaced my motorola DSL modem thinking it was possibly a problem since I was using the PPPoE in this router not the modem which was necessary to allow IP Pass-through . Replacing the modem had no effect , my DIR-655 stopped transmitting regularly again after that . I even set the channel selection of the router to a fixed channel instead of the auto select with no success . After replacing both hardware items , updating all to the latest firmware , I knew it had to be a setting problem , just what ? Having setup Dlinks before , an Apple extreme , a belkin and also a many linksys routers over the past 10 years I Liked the user interface of the Dlink best so I persisted over the next 3 or 4 days in changing every setting one at a time to find the right combo to make it work correctly . There is something in this routers firmware that will not accept the use of TKIP only for very long . Each time the router stopped transmitting I would reboot it and it would limp along for several more hours until something changed , likely a frequency collision from a neighboring router that forced a channel change or something . The solution I found was to set one network SSID using B\/G only , and TKIP only for the DWL-G820 's and the other network using all three B\/G \/ and N plus TKIP and AES for the laptops , DVD player network stream and the IPAD . Prior to finding the solution the best my laptop would connect and flow data at was about 54 Mbs . now using the multi SSID -LRB- with routing across networks enabled -RRB- and the auto TKIP , AES my laptops , Dell and Sony connect at 300 Mbs steady and truly . I transfered a 450 Mb ISO file and it took just over a minute so the 300 is real . I post this to help anyone else who orders this and pulls their hair out . The critical thing to address in the settings is the security . It must be TKIP AND AES to get the 300 Mbs rate N speed along with steady transmitting , and the G speed devices using TKIP only must be on the guest network , well at least be on opposite networks however you set them up . meaning whichever network SSID uses B\/G only for those devices then the other one can be TKIP and AES to allow fast throughput . I found the quirk about the TKIP only when I tried to use one SSID network in N only . That is when the router prompted me saying `` You ca n't use N only with TKIP only '' definitely an obscure place to have to find out . Now though I am glad I persisted because I am now getting blazing stable speed and distance on my network . I have n't tried the USB port since I have all my external drives shared through windows 7 PC 's that run 24-7 . I may be making the wrong assumption about the solution but with my router setup this way using one B\/G and TKIP then the other B\/G\/N and AES it works solidly . Kudos to Amazon for the fast exchange of routers , too bad Dlink tech support failed as well as the GUI of the router that made it so hard to find a solution to the conflict in settings .

One , two , three , four , five , six ... This router works great , easy to install , fast speed . Do n't know really what else to say ... 	Wireless Router
I bought this unit to use as a repeater to use in conjunction with my Netgear WNR3500 . I figured it would be a simple way to expand the Wi-Fi Range of the house . Unfortunately this 3500L did not work well in conjunction with it 's older brother the straight 3500 . V1 . I did enjoy it 's open firmware capability easily swapping out the stock Netgear firmware for the more expansive DD-RT . I also loaded DD-RT onto an old WRT54G Linksys and the 3500L easily married together as a repeater system . Go figure . 	Wireless Router
Replaced a `` hanging '' LinkSys BEFW11S4 that need daily resets . The D-Link has n't needed a reset and offers better N thru-put and WiFi range . Works with Mac 's , Apple TV , PS3 , and TiVo USB WiFi . 	Wireless Router
The software on the router is pretty good . It 's easy to use , and it seems feature complete . Way more features than I 'll ever use , but nice to know they 're there if I ever want to twiddle . I 'd like to give it 4 or 5 stars . The problem with this box is that it reboots several times an hour , if not more frequently . This is my experience , and it seems to be a common one . It is infuriating , frustrating , and disruptive to my workflow . It takes approximately 20 to 90 seconds to come back online -LRB- I have n't timed it -RRB- , which does n't sound that bad until you get nailed 10 times in one hour -LRB- that 's about as bad as it gets ; sometimes it goes for hours without rebooting -RRB- . According to various forums , lots of people have this problem -LRB- just google `` dir-655 rebooting '' -RRB- , and there does n't seem to be a consensus on a solution . The solutions that worked seemed to involve black magic or pure luck , as they would work for one person would not work for another . Most people reported continued problems , even after getting a replacement from DLink . Yes , I have the newest firmware -LRB- I 've even reflashed it several times , just in case -RRB- . I 'm running a minimal configuration , nothing fancy beyond password protecting the wireless . This happens when my laptop is the only computer on its network . I have not contacted DLink . For now , I 've propped it up on its side to increase ventilation -LRB- one of hotly contested but ultimately unverified rumors is that the reboots are heat related -RRB- . We 'll see how it goes . Next , I 'll call Comcast and see if they have any insight . -LRB- Wireshark shows what seems to me to be an excessive amount of ARP requests . Could that be it ? I 'm not a networking expert by any means -RRB- . I recommend buying another product until this long running issue -LRB- I 've seen posts from 2007 -RRB- is resolved . 	Wireless Router
Edited review because finally found something nonobvious just after posting . I 'm EMF sensitive so I ca n't use wifi . Nobody makes wired only routers and I needed one for fast speed . So bought this to be a wired router . There are two separate selections for `` wireless '' and the one to turn off the radio is not under the selections for wireless . You also wont find the information in the manual , on the website if searching for `` turn off wifi '' or `` turn off wireless '' , and you cant get phone support because they charge you a fee to even talk to you despite their poor other tech support . So i 'm starting out using this router with a frown and will see whether it does the job or not . At least it appears to have QoS support which was a critical feature for me wanting to use VoIP on a heavily used internet connection . 	Wireless Router
THIS ROUTER IS AWESOM BUT IT WILL ONLY SUPPORT 1 XBOX WE HAVE 3 AND YOU CAN NEVER GET MORE THAN 1 TO HAVE A OPEN NAT TYPE THE OTHERS ARE USUALY MODERATE OR STRICT WHEN I CONTACED SUPPORT THEY WERE VERY NICE AND TRIED THRE BEST TO GET IT WORKING RIGHT BUT TO NO AVAIL BOTTOM LINE IF YOU JUST HAVE A COMPUTER A LAPTOP AND 1 360 YOU WILL BE FINE AND VERY SECURE THIS ROUTER IS WELL WORTH THE MONEY 	Wireless Router
We bought this router because it claimed it was easy set-up . After spending 4 + hours on the phone with Cisco support and then being told we would need a higher level support person to call us back in 1-2 days we gave up . We have a new HP laptop and should have had no issue connecting . Really disappointing product and now I have to pay to ship it back to Amazon . Not pleased at all . 	Wireless Router
Like all the other reviews say , AVOID THIS PRODUCT . THIS THING DISCONNECTS . THE SIGNAL JUST DROPS . IF YOU LIKE GETTING UP TO UNPLUG AND REPLUG THE POWER CORD TO GET THIS THING WORKING -LRB- for at least 10 minutes before it happens ALL OVER AGAIN -RRB- THEN SURE . BUY IT . YOU 'LL ENJOY GOING BACK AND FORTH BACK AND FORTH BACK AND FORTH . I 'll give them credit the customer support is awesome however this product is not . It sucks . No matter how good the tech support you 'll never actually get this thing to work , and stay working . They 'll give you some steps if you 're having a hard time but the thing just reverts back to the same issues eventually . No point in getting a replacement , it seems this entire F7D1301 model is flawed . I 'd suggest LinkSys . I NEVER had an issue with routers until I got a Belkin . With LinkSys the internet just . . worked . 	Wireless Router
This has been a great Router , it was very easy to set up and has worked perfectly . I had problems with my previous Router , trouble connecting & continously going off line . The only time it worked well was if I had no security & ran an open line . This Router has worked awesome with the security features and never drops off line . I recieve a very strong signal throughout the whole house . Would definately recommend this product . 	Wireless Router
We are a `` mixed '' household . Mostly Apple but also a netbook . On a recent 2 week trip to Hawaii , the hotel said `` free internet '' and we arrived and there was an ethernet cable -LRB- and for full disclosure , it was free -RRB- . Well , my wife 's 11.6 Air and the iPhones , not an ethernet port in sight . The netbook had them but that did n't help with the Air or the iPhones . I never even considered that `` free internet '' meant an ethernet cable and no WiFi . I should have and have run into this before but this time decided to be prepared for the next time I space this out . Fast forward a month , after my purchase of this little guy and we are in Palm Springs . For a month . The owners of the condo had forgotten the password on their wireless network . I went into our gear bag pulled this little guy out and 10 minutes later everything is connected and running just fine . The range is n't great but it seems stable enough . Would I run a large home on it as a permanent installation ? Absolutely not . It works great for a backup or a hotel room or a condo . Exactly what bought it for . This thing is tiny . I configured it with Safari for XP on the netbook . No cords , CD 's , muss or fuss . Worked great . 	Wireless Router
UPDATE 2011\/12\/2 : Going strong for half a month now . As far as I recall , no reboots , or maybe one for an unrelated reason . I am raising my rating from one star to three stars . It would have been four if I would n't have had to go through all of this hassle to get it to work right . Netgear should have left well enough alone with firmware v1 .0.4.55 NA and hardware version 1 . UPDATE 2011\/11\/15 : Smallnetbuilder dot com stuck with firmware version v1 .0.4.55 NA according to one of their articles that referenced the WNDR3700v1 test results . That version was still available on Netgear 's support site -LRB- just click `` show all versions '' -RRB- . I loaded that with the following ritual : Hold reset switch 30 seconds with power on -LRB- still 1.0.16.98-dnsNA firmware -RRB- . Keep holding , turn power off , hold for 30 seconds while power is off . Still holding , turn power on . Then turn power off and let go of reset switch and wait 10 seconds . Boot up , leave on for at least two minutes , and do software factory reset -LRB- from backup menu in web GUI -RRB- . Let it reboot . Then upload and install v1 .0.4.55 NA from web GUI . Then do a software reset again . Then re-upload and install v1 .0.4.55 NA . I do n't know if all of this is really necessary . It is my compilation of all the posted paranoia out there . Now set up your preferred SSID names , Port Forwards , DHCP range , etc. . I did n't change any of the QOS or WAN settings . I left NAT as secure . I set up the 2.4 GHz radio as G -LRB- 54Mb\/s -RRB- with WEP , the 5GHz radio as N single band -LRB- 130Mb\/s -RRB- , WPA2 Personal AES . You can probably set it up for 300Mb\/s -LRB- double wide -RRB- if you want . Now everything with youtube and IPTV have been fine for about a day . l already received an RMA number . But if all goes well for another couple of days , I 'll keep the unit . If not and I return it , I will let you know here . The rationale behind the paranoid flash procedure is to make sure that another firmware version 's setup -LRB- usually a slightly different size when backup-stored , with slightly different options -RRB- does n't corrupt the the new firmware footprint -LRB- I guess -RRB- . I do n't know if someone had a rational method of coming up with it -LRB- e.g. , ex-Netgear engineer with some inside knowledge -RRB- or it was just someone 's gut feeling . END OF UPDATE . I searched out a WNDR3700 VERSION 1 because that is the version that got rave reviews at smallnetbuilder.com . -LRB- Netgear screwed up the version 2 by skimping on the antenna array . -RRB- I found this `` Refurb '' version 1 and thought I had lucked out . The seller was very helpful in making sure I got the right version . I suspect Netgear takes defective returns , wraps them in new plastic , and labels them `` Refurb , '' and hopes they work or that whatever defect they had would not be noticed by the new buyer . For some reason , they scratch out the serial number to signal that they wo n't support their refurbs . Why not ? Cisco-Linksys leaves serial numbers on refurbs and give them limited warranties . Or maybe Netgear so screwed up the firmware for this device that it does n't know what to do . This router started out looking good but then gradually slowed down to the point that even standard def youtube videos and highly compressed IPTV from Hulu Plus would slow down and freeze or stutter . I tried at least three versions of firmware and continued to have the same problem -LRB- 1.0.6.98 NA as shipped , and then 1.0.7.98 NA , 1.0.4.68 NA , and finally the latest 1.0.16.98-dnsNA -RRB- . The labeling of firmware itself is a mystery and suggests that this company is just scrambling to put out fires . What happened to everything between 1.0.7 . x and 1.0.16 . x for example ? And why was 1.0.16.98 label reused for the beta 1.0.16.98-dnsNA instead of calling it 1.0.16.99 NA ? Also , the auto-update only shows up to 1.0.7.98 . The internet is filled with similar complaints about slow downs and freezes , trying various firmwares , and doing various magic spell rituals before upgrading -LRB- holding reset button for 10 seconds , or 30 seconds , or doing it twice , unplugging with reset pushed , and so on -RRB- . I tried the most burdensome rituals in case there was something to them . Just in case anyone gets one of these , the only way I could get even initial acceptable results in youtube was to change the NAT setting from `` secure '' to `` open . '' Not so safe . I have applied to return this piece of garbage . It is back to my old Linksys WRT600n with DD-WRT for now . My only complaint about that dinosaur is that it suddenly looses the 5Ghz wireless connection when streaming a lot of video , probably because of overheating . It is about 3 years old . So I am still looking for a reliable replacement . 	Wireless Router
This is THE router for those who want to save some $ $ $ by not ` renting ' from a cable firm . This is an outstanding product , one that lives up to the PR . My mom , -LRB- in her 70 's -RRB- bought this for herself , and as a gift to me - say goodbye to hard router set-up 's . Valet PLUS is easy to configure , and was set up in about 7 minutes . The product pretty much set 's itself up - unlike other brands\/products . The range is GREAT - upstairs , downstairs , outside , or in a basement - four bars , all the time . If you are a bit shy about setting up a router\/network , this is the one for you . The set-up is goof-proof , and offers a superior result . SUPER EASY ! -LRB- really -RRB- . 	Wireless Router
I 've now owned ten -LRB- 10 -RRB- wireless routers -LRB- and before that , wired-only routers with separate wireless access points -RRB- . Two years ago , I had to replace my trusty Linksys WRT54G -LRB- the antenna degraded to a point of no return -RRB- . I purchased a NETGEAR WNR2000 -LRB- which I exchanged with NETGEAR corporate for a WNR834Bv2 -RRB- , Belkin N + -LRB- small buffer overflowed and rendered my Slingbox useless -RRB- , and Linksys WRT160N -LRB- whose wireless radio went bad after three MONTHS -RRB- . Right before acquiring the D-Link , I purchased an Apple Airport Extreme -LRB- which I had waited years for -RRB- . You know what ? The ~ $ 80 D-Link is better . I could n't get USB-attached storage to work on the AirPort , yet it works FLAWLESSLY on the D-Link . `` One computer at a time ? '' Share the drive using Windows\/Samba . Problem solved . This is the best router I 've owned . My \* only \* complaints are for the time-wait after small changes in the admin interface , and the Wireless-N is single band and does n't operate too well with computers expecting dual-band -LRB- 2.4 \/ 5.2 -RRB- .

I have been using this for about two months now . I am not using any advanced features just the basics . It is about 3-4 times faster than my previous G router . Range is OK . Setup was basic . Has not dropped connection yet . Satisfied so far . 	Wireless Router
Crazy thing about time setting . Although time zone was set and saved , it kept reverting to its default : Pacific time . This affects schedule features and other functions . Also , on a few occasions , the year was shown to be 2003 with a totally different month , day , and time . This is bad because issue already surfaced earlier this year -LRB- just google -RRB- . Apparently the bug has not been fixed although the manufacturer is aware of issue -LRB- for months -RRB- . Calling customer service ? Do so only if you enjoy going through the unending loops that would end where you began , after many wasted hours of waiting and talking ... . . This NEW router has speed and range BUT the firmware is worse off than my 5-year old Netgear . Will return it for a new one . 	Wireless Router
I had a difficult time finding a router that worked well with encryption enabled with all my computers and my Wii and PS3 . All are running flawlessly on this router with WPA2 security enabled . I have one wireless N device , and the speed I get with that laptop is excellent . Overall I am very pleased with this router ; it missed getting a fifth star because the setup was n't as user-friendly as I would have liked , but that was more of a problem with the PS3 than with any other device . The speed and thoroughput I get with all the rest of my wireless devices , which are all wireless G , is also great . The PS3 , for example , is in the master bedroom , while the router is in the office on the complete opposite side of the house . I have a 67 % signal strength on the PS3 consistenly , and it works great . 	Wireless Router
Multiple computer household , some wireless , Win XP , Vista , and 7 , wireless printer , three iPhones and a blu-ray player , all up and running withing 15 minutes using the Valet software . It just doesnt get any simpler than this , and streaming to the blu-ray is perfect even with netflix HD content . I previously tried a Belkin n router , it choked on the cable modem , could n't connect to anything . I rate myself a 3\/5 on the technical scale , but my 8 year-old did most of the work ...

"Netgear has the worst customer service I have ever experienced . I had bought a <ahref=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0041LYY6K/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/187-0041844-5278431""> NETGEAR N600 Wireless-N Dual Band Router with 4-port Ethernet Switch and USB Port </a> , and it stopped working w\/in 6 months of purchase . After calling the representative -LRB- which is in a call center in the Indian subcontinent somewhere but all with American names -RRB- , they kept telling me it 's my computer 's fault that the IP address had changed and not Netgear N600 router 's fault -LRB- when I plug my computer straight into my cable modem or use another wireless router , all my computers or phones work just fine -RRB- . They furthermore wanted me to subscribe to their 6 or 12 month subscription to fix the problem which started @ $ 79.99 and went up from there . They refused to acknowledge that their product has deficiencies which everyone else has mentioned all over the internet -LRB- see -LRB- ... -RRB- for example -RRB- and kept hassling me to buy their subscription which would allow them to remote into my computer . I do n't need them to remote into my computer , especially from someone I do n't know from overseas . They kept handing me off from one representative to another when I asked to talk to a supervisor and hung up after being on the phone waiting for 1 hr and 34 mins . I would never buy a Netgear product again and I would hope no one else does either since their product software will have a glitch just after their coverage runs out . If I pay over $ 100 for a product , it should still be covered for both software \/ hardware for at least a year and not nickel and dime customers . Worse , they hang up on a customer by using the tactic of handing off from one representative to another , and not allowing me to talk to the supervisor and then all of a sudden the line gets cut off when they realized I was not going to get off the phone . They continued to try to sell me more things vs. really helping me to solve my issue with their crappy product . NEVER BUY NETGEAR AGAIN ! "	Wireless Router
Not as easy to set up as some routers I 've had . The setup Genie kept telling me I had a static IP address . NetGear Customer Service agent `` Paul '' , after some testing , rebooting , and cable swaping told me I had to call my IP provider , Verizon , for internet connection issues . Before calling Verizon I reasearched the issue online and found if you are using Verizon then Verizon must release the MAC code and let it reassign to the new router . Try explaining that to `` Joseph '' , who sounded remarkably like `` Paul '' , in the Verizon overseas Call Center . After an hour of `` Joseph '' having me reboot , recable , and re-everything , `` Joseph '' told me my computer was broken and I needed to call the computer manufacturer for repairs . I loudly convinced him my computer was n't broken and got him to release the MAC code . The new router quickly accepted the code and after that the set up was simple . My home is a large 3 story with my office in the lowest level . I run 2 computers in my office , a Smart TV on the second floor , and two computers on the 3rd floor , two Smart Phones all around the house , and can sit on my deck or patio and use my laptop and Smart Phone without a hitch so the WNDR3700 seems to have enough range to do what I need it to do . I am giving it 4 stars because I am pleased with it 's performance , albeit brand new . I took away one star because I do n't think NetGear Customer Service did enough to research the issue . I would recommend this item , just remember if you are using a VERIZON router you will have to deal with `` Joseph '' , `` Paul '' , or `` Peggy '' . 	Wireless Router
After using multiple Linksys routers , this is a very welcome upgrade . I 've used Linksys for quite a while -LRB- both stock and dd-wrt firmware -RRB- . Previously , in an attempt to save a few $ $ , I used several routers bridged together to get coverage across our house . This resulted in a `` mostly stable '' network , however under heavy load I would experience drops and loss of connectivity . Our use is what I would say is typical family use -LRB- Inet browsing , streaming music , streaming movies from netflix -RRB- . Approximately 3 months ago , I upgraded to the N600 . Since then our network reliability has increased significantly . No drops , great throughput . The range is much better than what I would have expected . I 'd estimate that the range is 2x of what we had previously . Pros : - Great Range - Good throughput Cons : - A little pricey Closing thoughts : I 've read where these units start to fail after 6 months of service . Here 's to hoping this issue has been corrected . 	Wireless Router
works great . easy to setup . but configuring some settings were a little confusing . like setting the password for wireless signal . this is rated as one of the best routers . 	Wireless Router
This is the BEST , and ONLY wireless router you should buy . After NIGHTMARES with Netgear N wireless routers , and Tons of problems with Linksys , I tried on of these . Boy , it is like DAY and NIGHT ! First the Netgear Wireless -LRB- which use to be good -RRB- is now TOTAL JUNK , put your wireless netgear in the garbage . Also , Linksys is very bad too . This Wireless router performed exellent in a variety of areas , with a variety of network cards . Do n't like like a Newbie and buy a netgear or linksys , look like a genius when you buy this 655 . The speed is incredible through this thing , although my main concern was connectivity . Flawless all around , works with ever environment , and every card I threw at it . Works through walls . This is the new Defacto brand to buy , do n't buy anything else but this router . As a matter of a fact , do n't even buy newer models of the D-Link unless they have reviews like this one ! I used to HATE wireless until I bought this router , because I was tired of getting all the phone calls from employees who couldnt connect to our servers . Problem is solved now , never any calls , never any drops . Speed is INCREDIBLE ! Highly Recommended ! 	Wireless Router
I bought this Belkin router , strictly for wireless use on 1 laptop in a small apartment . It seemed simple enough to hook up , however , the password that was provided was faulty and I had to call tech support . After providing me with another password , I used the laptop wirelessly for about a few hours -LRB- with intermittent slowness -RRB- before it ` lost connection ' to the router . Keep in mind , I was using the laptop less than 10ft from the router . I had to call back tech support , only to spend an hour on the phone with a complete moron and get nowhere . They told me that someone else from tech support would call me back -LRB- which never happened -RRB- . I 'm returning this piece of junk today and going with linksys . 	Wireless Router
I must say this router puts out a very stable signal . The signal is powerful enough to penetrate three 6-inch concrete walls at a distance of 50ft . I get two of five signal bars , and even so it still stable to surf the internet at 54mbps - uninterrupted in wireless-G mode . The router features a massive amount of config options sure to satisfy a guru home techie . The router also is very compatible with other brands of wireless cards . I am using the wireless card that came with an HP DV6500 laptop . And as I mentioned before , the signal simply does not buckle from that distance . I wo n't bother to mention the obvious other features , but just to say it is a formidable router . I was gonna buy the linksys router but was n't sure if it could work in my situation . The setup was a bit weird , as the CD crashed my computer . I did get all up and running in less than 10 minutes in basic mode . Good stuff !!! 	Wireless Router
I purchased this router to increase the range compared to my 4 year old Belkin g router . After setting it up and talking to tech support for 2 hours , I still get the exact same signal -LRB- very low -RRB- as I did with the old g-class router . I am using an Asus netbook with an n wireless adaptor , but the DIR 655 performs exactly the same as an old g router from about 40 feet away . 6x ? 14X ? `` extreme-n '' ? . The exact same performance as a g-class router , the only difference is that the DIR 655 is more expensive . 	Wireless Router
Would not connect to an Atheros wireless adapter on one of my laptops . Customer support spent over 3 hours with me trying to resolve the problem . Evidently there is an issue using this router with an Atheros wireless adapter . 	Wireless Router
I 'd reccomend immediately upgrading to the latest firmware when you get this router . Before I did i was getting dropped wireless connections every 30 seconds or so and it would take 5-10 minutes to finally `` dhcp '' itself an IP address so we could get on the internet through it . After upgrading formware , the problems went away immediatley . I got my fastest download over our cable modem so far : 830kBps -LRB- -RRB- 6.6 mbps -RRB- . My old wireless router had a max connect speed for 5.4 mbps ... The web interface is not the best i 've seen , but it gets the job done . I think they should have hired a web designer to come up with a slicker and more user friendly one , but this is no biggie . It 's a decent device once it gets working , but i have read other people having the same problems i initially experienced with other AirLink products . It 's worth the really slim price you can usually find them at if you do n't mind a little bit of messing around with it . I personally got it for 22.99 on sale from 49.99 ... 	Wireless Router
If you are an advanced user and expect this router to be great at long range and the fact that it advertises as having a high power output , then you will be disappointed . If you look up the router and check out different forums you will see that a lot of users are having problems with the routers and their power output . The TX power changes constantly and is nowhere near the rated output . They also drop the connection of certain devices due to their chipsets not being liked by Buffalo . I have over the last few months tried to get this issue resolved to no avail , the technical support is at most restricted and can only offer a replacement . I have since received a new replacement from Buffalo but the replacement has the exact same problem . The sad part is that even my $ 20 5 year old Airlink has better output . I have tried to contact Buffalo about this countless times and they all do the same thing , try to trouble shoot and then offer a replacement . I am stuck with this router that is advertised as High output and have no use for it as it does not do what it advertises . If you are stuck I was following this thread and the second link has some sort of working command . -LRB- ... -RRB- 	Wireless Router
Router came with a CD . I connected two wired PC 's and wireless laptop in no time at all . I have read that router was hot to the touch , it is barely warm . Excellent buy . Very pleased . 	Wireless Router
lasted 8 weeks , 3 weeks after I bought it the wireless quit and 8 weeks later port 1 is gone . 	Wireless Router
I like Vonage and I like D-Link , but somehow together they dropped the ball on this one . See the above review on the router 's problem with keeping its security settings . I have the same problem . Every time it loses power you have to manually reset your security settings and passowrd . And you have to try fiveor six times before it will `` take '' . I called Vonage , their great suggestion was I should buy a new router . They offered to send me a new non-wireless VOIP device . . they wo n't support this router . D-Link ? They refer you to Vonage . . they do n't even HAVE a firmware update which might fix the problem . My advice , stay away from this dog . 	Wireless Router
all the positive reviews for this product are mostly true with ONE FATAL FLAW . good setup , good features , good range , etc. etc. . HOWEVER , after a few months , it stopped working and started making a weird high pitched sound , due to my Time Warner cable which resets it 's signal every 6-12 months . This is normal and I 've dealt with that many times with other routers by just plugging and unplugging the modem and router , no problems after . To have such a universal and normal thing blow up the modem is a major failure ... you KNOW it will break , which sucks after paying 2-3 times the price of other n routers . FAIL . 	Wireless Router
It was a little difficult to set up but once I get everything installed and hooked up correctly it works perfectly . Blows wireless b away in speed and connection times . I have n't had to reset it since I bought it to renew IP addresses which was also a problem with my last router . 	Wireless Router
This product worked very well for our office . We needed something for visitors to use while they are here between meetings and this was just what `` the doctor ordered '' ! 	Wireless Router
I purchased this on October 5 , 2009 -- little issue getting it set up , but no biggie . However , woke up this morning with no wireless internet . I reset to factory settings 7 times and changed the network names , passwords , ect to no avail . Even took my Mac to the local Mac Store , and it had no problems with their network . No matter what I have done , I can not get this thing to work . So , while the speed was good , and I had no other issues for the past three months-it just quit working . I am so unhappy given the amount I spent on this product ! 	Wireless Router
Too expensive if you buy it at a normal price , I will prefer ASUS RT-N16 or even E3000 from Linksys . But DIR-655 has a nice base to let the device standing vertically which the latter lack . 	Wireless Router
I have used routers at home since 1995 . This router has been the best home router I 've owned to date and the first Netgear router I 've ever owned . I have used it for close to 6 months without any problems what so ever . I have 28 devices either wireless or wired that go through this to the internet from laptops , network cameras , SlingBoxes , VOIP SIP adapters , Wii , Wireless radio , IPhone , my TV , FTP server and the list goes on . I stream TV from the other side of the world through this router and the bandwidth is very stable and it functions brilliantly . I make SIP calls around the world using the WiFi side of it and have never had any problems . Forwarding more than 20 ports through the router was very simple . The router allows me to monitor my bandwidth use with easy . Wireless coverage has improved a great deal since switching from a different brand of router . I changed my internal network from a 192 . x.x.x network to a 10 . x.x.x network with easy . I very easily added a guest network on both the G and N side of the router . The 2 separate radios -LRB- G & N -RRB- function very well and independently of each other . I have DOCSIS 3.0 at home and have had speed tests well over 100mbps using the N radio . The coolest thing of all is that other than finding the default password when I fired the unit up , I have never read the instructions . The router is simple yet powerful with some amazing functions at a great price . I would recommend this router to anyone . 	Wireless Router
This company in their infinite wisdom gave this unit the SAME address as the common ATandT yahoo modem . To correct this problem hook up the modem with the router and sign on to the internet , but wait ... they dont work together because of the conflict . You therefore cant sign on with them hooked up to correct the problem . Does this sound circular ? There is a customer support line for you to call LONG DISTANCE and be on hold for half an hour or better at YOUR expense . There you get someone that has learned a years worth of ENGLISH from a book so cant understand what you are saying . After several minutes of them not being able to understand your questions , they drop connection . You can either get BACK in the customer support line ... on hold ... long distance at YOUR expense , or throw the item in the trash . Please dont waste your money . Before you buy ANY router , please go to its support page . See if your DSL provider is listed there with NUMEROUS complaints . Though to be fair , I can understand how small the company AT and T is and therefore why THIS company hasnt bothered to put out a product that does not conflict . Also be aware that their web site has BLATENTLY written `` We give NO refunds for ANY reason '' . Now if this unit were NOT such a problem why would they NEED to write that ! Please ignore the GLOWING reviews written by employees of this company and go see their web page for yourself . BEWARE ! The company doesnt give refunds so Im essentially throwing over a hundred bucks in the trash . Wanna join me or you wanna pass this by ? 	Wireless Router
Installed without any problems . It replaced my Linksys Wireless G network and it 's extra range is very good . 	Wireless Router
Great product . It 's my second router of this same model - one for home and the other for business . Works well , no problems . Only minor difficulties with set up instructions , but the customer service was great in helping me figure out setting up the security options . I would highly recommend this product . 	Wireless Router
lacks a lot of features , but faster than the zyxel it replaced which was limiting simultaneous connections to the net and forced this new buy . Other products had storage links to USB drives , which I wished this had because my current SANS drive is limited to 500GB and T100\/mb connection . The connection is so strong that I bumped the signal to low power . 	Wireless Router
Nothing worked easily with this Router . I had set up 4 other wireless networks with Netgear and Linksys . I followed the instructions very precisely . Although the router connected to the Internet , it would n't pass the connection to the wire connected computer . After three calls to Dlink Support , they finally figured that I should change the default IP address of the Router ... then it worked . Next I tried to connect laptops by wireless connection to the router . I was able to do so if there was no security on the network . But if I wanted to run WEP or WPA -LRB- which is what I wanted -RRB- it would n't make a complete connection ... only a limited connection that would n't allow me to use the Internet on the laptops . After spending three hours with Dlink Support , the technician finally got frustrated because nothing she recommended worked . So she gave me a silly excuse that the Dlink notebook adaptor needed a firmware upgrade . It did n't ... it had the latest firmware . By the way , the 655 came with firmware 1.02 . I upgraded all the way to 1.11 ... but nothing could make this sucker work . I 'm sure it connects flawlessly on many systems . But on mine nothing worked automatically . In the end I decided to return it . My system consisted of several Windows XP computers -LRB- all with SP2 -RRB- and a Vista computer . The wired computer was an XP . I have a Siemens DSL modem and ATT DSL . I think I may have read a post somewhere that this router does n't work with ATT DSL ... so maybe that was it ... do n't know . Needless to say I went back to my trusty Linksys G router . 	Wireless Router
This is connected to a PS3 , Xbox 360 , MAC , PC , PSP , iPhone and the Netgear ReadyNAS 2110 . It handles everything like a champ . My average connection speed from my wireless laptop to my readynas for data transfer is 180-200 Mbps which is very fast . All of them can be running at any given time and I never miss a beat . I did read some other reviews by others , about it not connecting , I am going to tell you that they probably have Cable , and they have not realized that you have to call your cable company to have them reset the modem , if you can see the network but ca n't connect to the internet , your modem needs to be reset from the cable company . They will try the first step which is to unplug the modem for 10-20 seconds and then plug it back in , then plug in the router , does n't always work but when I call them and have them send a `` hit '' it works with in seconds .

This is a fantastic Router . Guest network is great . Simple to use . Great features . There is a reason it does n't come down in price , because it does n't have too . 	Wireless Router
I spent most of the day installing this router . It looked really slick and the box touted a lot of cool options . I even went on the website and watched some of the MISLEADING videos about how easy it was to hook up a HD and a printer to the router and share them with all the computers on your network . I have both MAC 's and PC 's in my home office . They claim in the video that you just have to hook up a printer and go to your printer settings and find the network printer . This claim is FALSE . You have to download a clumsy app on your mac or pc that will autoload every time you turn on your computer . IF YOU HAVE A MAC YOU HAVE TO CONNECT THE PRINTER EVERY TIME YOU START YOUR COMPUTER UP !!! This entails you having to open the utility and check that you want to connect the printer to your computer . ARE YOU SERIOUS ! This is not the case on the PC 's this clumsy app will connect it automatically . The HD that I connected on the router is no where to be found . I am not a novice user , I checked all the settings and the web which resulted in NO ADVISE . This product sucks and I am seriously considering sending it back . DEFINITELY NOT WORTH THE MONEY !

This worked for about 30 minutes . When I logged into the router to change the password , an automatic update of the firmware started . After this , the router ceased working and there was nothing I could do to fix it . The green power light would only blink . Rebooting or hitting the reset button would not work . I spent 30 minutes on the phone with an almost unintelligible support person who could not resolve my problem but ended our discussion by claiming that routed `` needed to rest for 30 minutes - unplug it and call us back in 30 minutes . '' Stupidly , I did this and spoke with the next nearly unintelligible support person . She walked me through the exact crap the first guy did . Finally I hung up and googled `` blinking green power light '' for the model number . Turns out , apparently this happens often enough that there is a troubleshooting section in the user manual about this -LRB- corrupt firmware -RRB- and software on the CD-ROM to address it . However , even after running the software 3 times , it continued to time out and never could fix the issue . Back to the ` shack it will go and cisco will I buy from hereon ... 	Wireless Router
I purchased this router in July and have had nothing but trouble . Buffalo blamed the problems on my DSL provider and of course they blamed it on Buffalo . Turns out the Buffalo router was bad . Customer service was usually very nice , until the this last time when I guess they have grown weary of dealing with me . When I think of the hours I have wasted waiting on hold , and the wide variety of competency levels of the service people -LRB- but you get that anywhere -RRB- . My return window has closed so I have to send it back to Buffalo and get a replacement , but I doubt I will buy another one of Buffalo 's products . 	Wireless Router
After three weeks I 've just about had it . Bought this product at best buy after one of the kids there said you ca n't go wrong with a netgear . Boy was he wrong . first off the positive . Super easy to set up . It was a breeze . Comes with a netgear genie that fixes problems with one click of the mouse . The bad . First day I set up I get a ca n't connect with internet after a hour . No problem . Netgear genie to the rescue . Up and running in probably 2 minutes . The only problem is I get the message ca n't connect with the internet 3 times a day now . The problem is the 1st thing you 'll do is start up the genie and wait for the router to go down , because it will . Good luck streaming netflix . Your movie will stop at least once while your waiting for the genie to fix your problems . The genie used to fix the problem in a minute or two . Now sometimes I have to restart my computer . I thought about calling customer service but after reading the reviews on Amazon I figured why bother . Just chalk it up to a 80 dollar mistake and get a new router from a company that that wont crap out after 3 weeks . Anybody suggest one ? I figure I have about 2 weeks left with the netgear before I either get sick of the constant dropped signal or it quits working altogether .1 st router I 've been so frustrated by before . You pay 80 bucks you expect it to work out of the box . e 	Wireless Router
This router replaced my old Linksys router . Immediately I noticed a big jump in performance . Set up was easy and i was up and running in less than 30 minutes -LRB- includes firmware update -RRB- . The dual band is great and everything is working as per the specification . 	Wireless Router
I received my router on time and installed it promptly . I plugged it into my modem and was up and running within 15 mins . Coming from an old Linksys router , I felt the menu was easier to navigate . I have n't been able to play with the USB port yet . The range is good , not excellent . I was hoping for much better range than my old router but I would say it was slightly better . For the price , I 'm not complaining . A good companion to this router is the Dlink DWA-131 Wireless N Nano USB 2.0 Adapter . It did pick up the `` n '' band much better than the `` g '' band . Overall I 'm happy with the performance . I did n't spend over $ 100 so I ca n't complain . 	Wireless Router
Despite reports to the contrary , the PK5000 does support port forwarding and uPNP . In fact , the stock firmware has nearly as much functionality as DD-WRT . But it lacks support for multicast , so no Bonjour , iTunes streaming , mDNS , etc over wireless . It would get 3 or 4 stars otherwise , but no multicast is a remarkable oversight . 	Wireless Router
My title says it all - I was able to set up the router in 20 minutes - including adding a laptop and a wireless printer to the network . It took that long because I had to contact customer support with a question - I 'd recommend it for anyone that thinks setting up a wireless network is too difficult . 	Wireless Router
When looking at routers to buy I came across this one and it looked absolutely perfect as far as what was advertised . I got a little worried when I saw there were quite a few negative reviews , but I decided to chance it since there were more positive than negative and I figured if it did n't work I would be able to return it . Now that it 's set up , it 's working perfectly . I 'll have to wait a couple weeks to make sure , but so far it 's working amazingly well and I 'm getting 4 bars of connection where I used to get nothing with our old Linksys router . If it breaks down I 'll come back and edit this , but so far it 's great . LATER EDIT Getting random wifi drops after like 5 or 6 hours , but unplugging the router and plugging it back in fixes it right away . Looked up the problem and some people said to change the channel , so I did that , and now just waiting to see what happens 	Wireless Router
First off , I should state that I am probably a 5 % use case and that perhaps what I need is a small business-class router , but having tested this item at the limits of a home environment I can probably help some people out . Ok , on to my network : My WAN link is a high-grade Comcast cable connection The DIR-655 is connected to another outboard Gig-E switch . I forget the brand , but it 's nothing you would have heard of . Connected to the router and switch is : Windows Home server -LRB- Gig-E -RRB- 1 Desktop -LRB- Gig-E -RRB- 2 Desktops -LRB- 100 Mb -RRB- 1 Xbox 360 1 HP LJ-1300 something or other business-class laser with a built-in Jet Direct interface On the wireless : 1 Desktop Up to 6 laptops Up to 3 PSPs 1 iPod Touch Up to 4 smartphones Obviously , there was never a point where all these devices were in use , but a typical night would have up to 1 server , 1 printer , 4 desktops , 6 laptops an Xbox and a smartphone -LRB- 14 devices in all -RRB- simultaneously connected . Pretty damn impressive by my estimation . Most of the time , at least two of the machines are running a few torrents . This unit was purchased from a local retailer -LRB- Hard Drives Northwest -RRB- as a replacement for a Linksys WRT54G V. 4 running Tomato firmware . It served me heroically for many months in this extreme situation . It became apparent that the old hardware could n't service so many connections while running QoS . Additionally , some of my housemates with extreme RF obstruction were complaining of signal inconsistencies . I shopped around for a router that could do QoS , had wireless-N and was reasonably up to date . The DIR-655 was a fairly logical match . The initial setup was a bit frustrating . This unit relies heavily on the wizard . I 'm typically not a standard-use case and like to avoid wizards telling me what I want . It took a lot of prodding around the counter-intuitive interface to get all the settings I wanted in place . I was used to Tomato and even DD-WRT and those firmwares , despite being -LRB- or maybe because of -RRB- coded by open-source developers was far more intuitive and natural . I think the bottom line was that I had expectations that similar functions would be grouped together more logically . Interfaces being a highly subjective topic I 'll just stop with those observations The Problem : One of my not technically-savvy housemates was introduced to torrenting and like a lot of neophytes , he went nuts right out of the gate . This caused a massive failure of the router . One night , the router just stopped passing data . Everyone could connect wirlessly and could ping the router . I was able to access the console wirelessly and ping other wireless clients , but I could not get the router to issue IP leases to any of the devices that were connected over cat-5 \/ 6 to the gigabit switches . Once I assigned a static IP address to a machine I was still unable to communicate with anything . Bottom line : Nothing could pass between the wired and wireless parts of the router , so my WAN connection and by extension the internet was out of commission . I rebooted multiple times , reset to factory defaults multiple times and updated the firmware to the latest release . Each step was a temporary remedy , lasting for 3-5 minutes before everything seized up . During these periods of malfunction I was still able to get into the router 's console . Very strange . I tried many different scenarios , used the device with and without stuff connected to the wired part of the router , but as soon as I brought up the wireless it would just go tits-up after a couple of minutes . I had owned the router for a couple of months and my retailer very graciously swapped it out with a new unit . The troubles persisted . Eventually I brought the network back up and allowed laptops to connect one by one until the router failed . After isolating the one machine causing all the trouble , I found out why - the laptop 's owner was seeding about 20 torrents . Looking at the active sessions in the console I was able to see something like 100 connections all being used by this one laptop . After a short education on the technology behind torrent and why it can quickly become a network resource devouring monster he drastically pared down the number of torrents he keeps active . Ever since , the router has performed exactly as I had hoped with the possible exception of wireless reception in areas of the house where the signal has to pass through 3-4 walls and a floor . There 's no fixing that without me buying an additional access point . I 'm not shelling out any more cash for people that MUST have wireless access in their bedrooms . I 'm not bothered one bit by the fact that the router got the piss beaten out of it by a ton of torrents . This is a SOHO device . Overloading of the WIRELESS section of the router caused a complete failure of the WIRED section . Why ? This makes no sense and confounded my troubleshooting of the problem . This product loses one star for a goofy interface and a really odd failure mode . I still think it 's an excellent router , especially for less than a hundred dollars . Just be aware of the limits . After nailing down the problem , it has been humming along without a complaint . 	Wireless Router
I have had this router for about 2 weeks now and I am very pleased with it . The set-up was n't quite as helpful as I would have liked , but with a little patience , it set up after about 30 minutes . Have not lost a signal once and get coverage all over the house and even out to the back patio . Highly reccomend this router !! 	Wireless Router
D-Link 655 is very easy to set up using the CD it came with , just a caution at the end for this router . The Item works great . I have had a D-Link 612 for many years , maybe about 6 years . It has performed well until all these wireless items started coming out , like printers , Blueray players , Laptops , and Desk top computers . Maybe in the future the refrigerator will be connected . I know Thermostats and lighting might be connected or to run the whole home to access the items from outside the home . With all the extras , my D-Link 615 started to overload and shut down and had to be reset with unplugging the power . They dont last forever . The one thing they should put in the instructions , which security encryption for specific operating systems . DO NOT USE WPA encription for Windows XP , use WEP . That was the only problem I had setting D-Link 655 router up . I highly recommend a D-LINK 655 . I dont know much about newer ones with duel frequency , the only option I would love to have had was guest sign in capabilities . I didnt need the other . I give family and friends my code to get into the network anyhow . D-Link is a trustworthy company , I read many reviews from D-Link , Link SyS -LRB- Cisco -RRB- , and Netgear , seems people have trouble setting up and maybe they are not experienced enough , or too experienced and get into items they shouldnt have . I am almost a novice and it was easy . Dont beleve most of the bad reviews . 	Wireless Router
I have 2 of these and they are both great . DD-Wrt -LRB- and supported form the vendor -RRB- for $ 55 makes this an easy decision . I have them running in WDS 2 stories apart and get fantastic performance from my network . They have been running for about 2 weeks now and I have not had a single issue from either of them . Unlike some Linksys 's I upgraded , these seem to stay up w\/out unplugging the power to reset them . The price is fantastic and if you are looking at this because you are interested in DD-Wrt it should be an easy decision . 	Wireless Router
It 's probably not fair to rate this a one star but it would not work out of the box . The lights would come on but nothing would connect and when I called the 24\/7 support I found it was not open until 10am pacific time . Even my cable company could not reach them . Everyone has DOA equipment , its the nature of the technology today that its shipped without testing , hence the low cost . But I expected more from Netgear . 	Wireless Router
By far the best I have own . I was devating between the dir-655 or the DGL-4500 just because I play online games with the xbox360 -LRB- call of duty 4 -RRB- but so far I am extremely happy with the results and performance . The best thing is that all my other wireless connections -LRB- b and G -RRB- work better without the N card . About the only negative thing I can say is that there is no USB Xtreme adapter but other than that it works great . Advice : remember to check your pci connection -LRB- express or standard pci -RRB- before buying the card . 	Wireless Router
i was looking for a Gigabit router to replace my 6 year old linksys . I was going by the reviews and did n't think it would be that bad , it is worse . It was easy to setup but when I connected I kept losing speed . On downloads I would start out great but they never finished as the connection slowly worksed itself down until it dropped . I called service and got hung up on bt 2 reps , the 3rd rep kept going over the same items and when i told him I was hooked up with a wire he insisted the issue was with the wireless settings . I got a level 2 tech and they went over the same things the first tech did , and this time started to demand what my public IP was , when I told him my linksys works be it slow and this thing goes up and down he kept saying it could be an issue with my connection . I 'm going to return this and buy a netgear or linksys . Anything but a D-Link 	Wireless Router
We needed something that would boost the signal in our house , and this one did it . No more `` looking for networks '' and dropped connections . The extra feature that allows you to connect an external hard drive does n't work with any of the hard drives we have , so that 's a bummer , but it might work with other ones . So far , so good ! 	Wireless Router
I 've been using the Netgear N900 for almost a year now without any issues . It has n't locked up once , and I 've only had to reboot it when I did firmware upgrades . For the past several years , I 've only been using Linksys routers , so this was the first time that I 've used the Netgear interface . At first glance , it feels like the router interface is lacking in features , but Netgear hides it all away under an advanced menu . After poking through it for a bit , I feel like the N900 offers pretty much all of the same software features as Cisco\/Linksys do in their more expensive routers such as the E4200 . In general though , I feel like the Linksys interface is more responsive and much more intuitive . In terms of performance , this router has been performing admirably . In my apartment , I have an iPhone , iPad , laptop , desktop , several game consoles , networked printer , and a NAS . I have n't noticed any hiccups , and the router itself has n't locked up or crashed on me yet . File transfer rates are fairly snappy across 5GHz as well . Without any obstructing walls , I can pull files from my NAS at around 25-30MB \/ sec over 5GHz . The transfer rate drops down to 10-15MB \/ sec when it has to go through a wall . Overall , it 's a solid , stable router with lots of features . The USB ports are a great feature for households that want to share a printer or portable drive . The USB ports are also handy for charging lower powered gadgets like iPhones . 	Wireless Router
The Netgear Router was simple to set up and has worked well for the last couple to few months I have had it . I am very happy with this product and the price was very reasonable given its features and specifications . 	Wireless Router
Just got around to setting up my wireless network yesterday . Used the CD that came with it and setup was really simple . Got the security set up using the `` Set up a wireless network for a home or small office '' feature of the `` Wireless Network Connection '' in Windows XP . Product came up immediately and the signal is extremely strong . Unless I have reliability issues , this product gets 5 stars from me . 	Wireless Router
My internet was always giving me a weak signal until I upgraded to this router . Now , I do n't have that issue and am glad to be able to keep surfing the internet . Easy to install & looks good too . 	Wireless Router
I have only had this item for a week but so far it has been incredible . I replaced an old Linksys BEFW11S4 and cant believe i waited this long . The Dlink has been working perfectly and the speed of my downloads seems like its 4 times faster . If you are looking for a new wireless router this is the one to buy . 	Wireless Router
The router works great I am a real person and this is a real review , no bs . It 's a router it should work great enough said . 	Wireless Router
My old D-Link DIR-655 was starting to go off at random times , but I did n't relish the idea of going through the very painful setup procedure of that router . This Netgear router was a joy to setup . It has preset , two wireless networks with unique names and passwords -LRB- the password is not `` password -RRB- ... one network for 2.4 GHz and one for 5.0 GHz I would say overall , it took about seven minutes to set up my hard-wired desktop , a laptop , and two TIVO 's that receive their programming info over the same networks . The signal also seems to come in better at the most distant location -LRB- about forty feet away through several walls -RRB- . 	Wireless Router
I do n't know about some of these negative reviews , but mines seems to function according to specification . I believe that the negative reviewers did not take into accountability several factors : ISP 's technological setup , Operating System Compatibility , Basic Knowledge of Networking , whether D-Link DIR655 will work together with cable modem , whether or not their home was built using plaster as this will cause interference with receiving wireless signals to other devices in the house , and location of router in house -LRB- should always be where signal can trickle down to wireless devices . I also believe that one reviewer did not take-off the plastic protective covering over the vents or did not set it where it could breath , and this is why it was `` hotter than a firecracker . '' My Uses -LRB- so far -RRB- ... Let me say this first ... I have only utilized this for three days even though I 've had it one week earlier . Even though I have n't used this for very long , I 've done my homework before I went on to spend money upgrading from Comcast 's crappy Netgear Cable Modem Gateway -LRB- an all-in-one wireless router and cable modem using Wireless G technology -RRB- . The difference was very definite for me as I saw a tremendous boost in my signal , speed , and overall dependability -LRB- mostly due to my new Cable modem I purchased with this -RRB- . I would recommend that Comcast\/Cable Modem users buy the Motorola Surfboard 120 Cable Modem along with this because it uses DOCSIS 3.0 , and even if you do not have the high echelon of speed from your Cable ISP , this will enhance your lower-paid speed as it did my 16Megs of speed on my -LRB- DOCSIS 2.0 -RRB- connection . Many people do not research things , or go by the advice of others . Even if you read my comment make sure that you can afford the upgrades , research the compatibility of your wireless devices\/computers , research the capabilities of your ISP , research how this will effect your Internet bills , research the make of you home as well as the layout , and research the frequencies of devices in your house that could interfere with your router . I would also recommend that if you upgrade from your current setup -LRB- if it was installed by a ISP technician -RRB- that you have a technician install your equipment -LRB- cable modem , router -RRB- if you do not have the technical expertise to do this on your own merit . I would have to give another review later on regarding the overall reliability and USB Share-port technology -LRB- heard Share-port on this was not very great , but got the job done if you think of it on terms as a networked printer -LRB- only one person can use whatever USB device you hooked-up to this router at a time . -RRB- -RRB- . My verdict , as of only three-day use ... very good ! Would suggest to anyone looking to upgrade their router to include this in their RESEARCH . Great value for the wallet , and great signal strength if upgrading from older equipment like I did . Wireless N technology sure does a hell of a job compared to Wireless G or even Super\/Range-Max Wireless G. Great Job -LRB- so far anyways -RRB- D-Link ! 	Wireless Router
Based on good reviews , I bought this keyboard -LRB- and the Arc Touch Mouse , which has the same trouble -RRB- for use with my home theater PC . With the receiver plugged in to the front of the computer a whopping 8 feet away the keyboard gets little or no reception , resulting in slow or no input on the keyboard . I have to hold the keyboard at odd angles -LRB- i.e. angling the bottom so it faces the receiver -RRB- and\/or up in the air to get it to function at all . I tried disabling my wireless network to eliminate any interference , but no , it 's all about where I place the keyboard . Will not work on my lap at all , has to be held up in the air . I 'm kicking myself for not keeping the box so I could eat the restocking fee and return this for a keyboard I can actually use . I 'm sure this would be a great keyboard on a desk right next to the computer , but one would n't want a mini keyboard like this for that application . This keyboard completely fails at what is one of it 's obviously intended uses -LRB- home theater PC -RRB- . 	Xbox
As I said it , it is too small for any practical use . The only use I can find i trying to type in when i am taking a dump , and i do not do that very often . Looks sweet . the rest is just another hate story , If you really want to make someones life miserable , gift him this . I am thinking it of selling this as a device parents can use to punish their children , `` for next two days Peggy you are using Microsoft Arc '' . I am sure Microsoft Design team has laid of every staff member who showed even an ounce of practicality . I am sure Microsoft has some initiation ritual or brain wash thing going on for its designers where the are made to drink tom Leary made potions and forced to believe in unicorns . 	Xbox
Just what you need in a wireless keyboard , light , compact , efficient , and no connection problems . transfers to different computers with out any hassle . Does not have the number pad , but is a GREAT compact keboard ! Ordered from amazon and package arrived in two days ! Definately pleased with this product , our dental office currently uses three of these keyboards ! 	Xbox
I was a little leary ordering this online , but was very pleased when it arrived promptly and in good working order . I was even more pleased when I got it hooked up and it worked ! I will probably order future electronics accessories through this company . 	Xbox
First of all , I bought this for playing games on the computer , recording video was just a bonus . Hookup & driver installation was painless and the software interface is very straightforward . The video does not lag although I only tested it with a PSX and Castlevania SOTN . The only problem I have is that the audio starts to lag after a bit of play . It gets off by about 3 seconds . The strange thing is , if you record your gameplay or whatever and playback the video , the audio is synched up ! I 've searched Adaptec 's knowledge base with no answers & have seen people posting in forums that they had the same problem . It 's not an issue with my PC as my system specs over-exceed the minimum & recommended requirements . If Adaptec can fix this audio issue , they 'd definitely get 5 stars from me . 	Xbox
I use this as a space saver for my desktop . I have two computers at my desk and real estate is at a premium . Between keyboards , mice , monitors , digitizing tablet , and flatbed scanner , this little keyboard allows me to tuck it out of the way . The four way arrow key takes a bit to get used to , as does the positioning of the hands . -LRB- they lopped off the right hand side where the keypad used to be -RRB- . The keys are great and fairly quiet . They depress very similar to that of a laptop -LRB- but not quite the same -RRB- . No idea about the reception quality as I brought the transceiver up to the desktop with a short extention cable . 	Xbox
I was in the market for a wireless keyboard , and this little guy popped up quite a bit on my searches . My requirements were that it have decent range -LRB- as I was using the keyboard to type on my computers that are connected to my entertainment systems\/tvs -RRB- and be small enough to have on your lap or carry from room to room , yet still fairly ergonomically friendly . I basically wanted to be able to sit on my couch or in bed use it . I picked mine up for 29.99 on sale locally , and I am quite pleased . Its small , sleek , and I have not had any problems with range . I did n't need a number pad , and was surprised that it does have the arrow keys , all combined into 1 multi functional key , which was is a bonus . Couple downsides , it does need line of sight , if you have some obstructions , knees , pillows , etc you might notice a few missed key strokes . Also , I knew it did n't have illuminated keys , but when its less than ideal lighting , it is quite difficult to see the keys sometimes . Also I would of preferred it in white , but apparently the white version costs more , that white paint sure is expensive these days ... Other than that , compared to the 100.00 + keyboards I was looking at , I 'm completely happy with this little one , I would recommend it . 	Xbox
All right let me give a short review about this controller , and I hope it will help other buddies a little bit . First , not every game supports controller , not only this one , but also others . If the game you are playing supports controllers . You just need to go to control option to set as you wish . BUT most of the PC games do not support controllers . In this case , you will need Xpadder , please google it . You can set the keys on your controller based on those on your keyboard , one to one , accordingly . You can also set it shaking if you want . I already beat Call of Duty World at War using this controller , and now I am playing The Witcher . Both of these two games do not support controllers , but it is not a big deal . By using Xpadder , its not gonna be a problem to worry about . Another thing about Xpadder : Like RPG , you have a lot of shortcuts on your keyboard so you can drink your potions more quickly or sth . The problem is your controller does not have enough keys to hold all of this keys on your keyboard . By using Xpadder , you can set some `` Function Keys '' , that 's what I call it . While setting your controller , you can save two or more keys to be used as function keys . I chose LB and RB , and then just set these two keys . Click this key in Xpadder , and then click Advanced , and then click Set Selector , and then choose Select Set 2 while held , and then go to Set 2 and set other functions . So you lose two keys to use -LRB- LB and RB -RRB- , but while holding LB or RB , your controller would go to another Set so actually you would have access to more functions . Take me , now when I am holding LB , XYAB would become my shortcuts to access to potions , and RB they would become the shortcuts to change my weapon . I was just grand when I found this way and could n't wait to share it . 	Xbox
The Nyrius SW100 Digital Audio switch is very simple and basic . I really have only one significant complaint and one minor complaint . The major complaint is how sensitive it is to the exact position of the switch . It does lock in place when switching to a new input\/output but there is enough play in it that it usually takes a minute or so of trial and error to get any audio through switch . Once it does switch it seems to work well . The minor complaint I have is the fact that either the inputs or the output must be in the front . It seems like it would be more useful if the output port was at 90 - 135 degrees from the input ports it would fit more conveniently into the AV cabinet . 	Xbox
Feels and responds as well as on the Xbox 360 . However , the cursed 360 D-Pad is legendary in how awful it is . The analogs on it are great , and the controller is one of the best ergonomic controllers I have used . I got it so I could do XNA development on the PC using a 360 controller a lot easier . It in turn works well for that purpose . For $ 10-15 more than a wireless controller by itself , you get a receiver that lets you use Xbox 360 wireless controllers on a PC , which should also include controllers like the Guitar Hero Ax and fighting sticks . Microsoft somewhere even tells you how they are mapped . 	Xbox
I 've used this toslink switch for about a month now , and I have been very pleased with it overall . It is a little bigger than I expected , but in my opinion , that makes it feel more sturdy and of higher quality . I have a PS3 , Xbox 360 , and TiVo all connected to it , and the switch allows me to route the optical audio for each of them directly through to my surround sound system -LRB- which sadly has only 1 toslink\/optical input -RRB- . The design of the switch seems to be pretty simple ; the switch allows the optical audio to flow from one input through to the output , with no electrical transformation of any sort ; you can shine a light through one end and see it appear out of the other . This is a simple yet important feature , because it allows various forms of audio encoding to be transmitted through the switch unimpeded , such as Dolby Digital , DTS , and all others . By comparison , my HD television has an optical audio input as well as output , but it does not output Dolby Digital signals . So with that setup , I could never get true surround sound from any of my devices , even though they support it . If your equipment supports surround sound , you owe it to yourself to make sure you can actually hear it ! PROs : Does exactly what you need it to do Perfect audio clarity Inexpensive Probably is n't going to need replacing anytime soon CONs : A little larger than most people might like Having to walk over to it in order to change the switch -LRB- but is still worth the extra hassle -RRB- Summary : If your stereo system does n't have enough toslink inputs , buy this item !

This is a great splitter ! I 'm using it w \/ a 50 ' HDMI cable , w \/ no signal degradation whatsoever even w \/ 3D . One thing that needs to be mentioned . Not all HDTVs will accept 1080p signal from a 50 ' cable . I purchased a Sharp LC-46SV49U TV and when hooked up to my Comcast DVR , some stations were appearing w \/ grainy picture and audio that cuts in and out . I came to realize that it was because the signal was 1080p . The TV accepted 1080i\/720p\/480p \/ 480i just fine , but not 1080p . I called Sharp and was told that it would not accept a cable -RRB- 25 ft w \/ 1080p . Please be wary of this problem with Sharp TVs . I 'm not sure if any other brands share this issue , but all resolutions can be accepted w \/ no problem w \/ a 50 ft cable on both Samsung and Panasonic TVs . I returned the TV and purchased a Samsung UN46EH6000 , which works with this splitter and 50 ' ft cable with no problem . I would definitely recommend this splitter to anyone , but you just want to be sure you have a compatible TV if you want to run 1080p through a 50 ' cable . 	Xbox

Got 2 of these a couple months back , and theres been no problems what so ever . The only thing I wish was , on the pack itself , the light would turn a different color when fully charged -LRB- its always a solid green no matter what -RRB- BUT , small price to pay for not having to deal w \/ battery packs\/rechargable batterys . Like I said , cant beat the price-under 10 bucks -LRB- w\/shipping , for TWO -RRB- 	Xbox
Unaccustomed as I am of NOT saying anything good about Microsoft , I wo n't start now . Despite the fact that M\/S partially redesigned the keyboard layout to fit into a smaller foot print , which takes some getting used to , , , the keyboard does have some good features . The spacing between the keys is greater than my Logitech which makes it easier for bad typists such as myself . The color of the lettering on the keys -LRB- green on ivory -RRB- is awful . In some angles of light , the letters disappear . Again , making it difficult for us `` bad typists '' . And the little arrow direction key in the lower right hand corner , , , NOT a good idea .

Yes , it 's for my wife . Too many times have I gotten the call where I 've had to explain to her that in order for my son to watch Curious George , she needs to set TV input to Video 2 , set stereo to Auxiallary , turn on the Xbox , turn on the remote control , blah blah blah . So I got her this for X-mas , and put all the other remotes away . Now with one button she 's got Curious George or Cars playing , and with another she 's watching DVR 'd episodes of Oprah . I love being able to customize all the buttons and the order in which everything happens . This remote just works nice and easy . If something is n't where she wants it , I can reprogram it . We 're not slaves to the remote , it works for us . And the best part is that my work meetings no longer end in people laughing at me and saying `` I do this twice a day . '' Get this remote . If not for yourself than for your poor , technoilliterate loved one . EDIT : Did n't last very long and I do n't know why . Replaced it with another Logitech that lasted less than a year -LRB- son put the second one in a glass of water -RRB- . 	Xbox
I gave my daughter a ps3 , and got her HD Cable DVR box both of which use HDMI but i also gave her a xbox 360 -LRB- using VGA -RRB- to connect to her HDTV in her college apartment so she can have fun ; hey , it 's her 3rd year and she is doing good . sounds great but so that she could have 5.1 sound i gave her my old computer speaker sound system that does n't support HDMI but does have one optical input and will support DD & DTS 5.1 since it comes with 5 speakers and a sub . i needed to connect all of these devices to it and they all have optical out but i needed an optical switch and found this one online at amazone . I am very happy to say that this thing works like a charm ! we plugged in all three devices optical cables into this switch , connected the output of the switch into the speaker systems mini receiver port and everything had 5.1 instantly . it 's easy to install and simple to use . it has a big rotary switch that you turn and to ensure it 's locked properly you have to press a button in on the switch as you turn it , this causes and ensures it locks and engages the port you want properly . i kinda wish it was a push button to select the input you wanted but for the money , nothing beats this . it does exactly what it says it will do . we are very happy with it . if anyone needs a optical switch , this is a good one and yes , i recommend it to anyone who needs one .

I used this product in conjunction with the Soundblaster Tactic 3D Sigma headphones . Let me tell you , I was amazed by the quality of the sound and the extremely accurate surround sound that the recon3D is able to produce . The packaging is eye catching , neat and minimalistic . The unit is held in place firmly and protected from any rough handling that may occur during shipping . All the regular extras are included , manual , drivers etc. . On top of that all the required cables for connecting this to an xbox360 or PS3 are included as well however I only used this with a PC . The unit itself is very sturdy . It feels solid and finished . The buttons are responsive and feel responsive when pressed . It 's a very good looking piece of technology with blue lighting on black that matches the look of my rig perfectly . Now let 's get to the good stuff . Installation was a breeze with the included drivers . The control panel is very easy to navigate and includes tons of options : equalizer , surround sound and my favorite the crystallizer . This option enhances the sound dramatically in my opinion . It makes the highs clearer and the lows sharper . I do n't know how to describe it exactly but I love it ! There is a Scout mode button that once pressed enhances the sound of footsteps . The way I experienced it was that the unit enhances certain frequencies to bring out the sound of footsteps more and this is great if you play lots of First person shooters but I felt it altered the sound too much for my liking . As I mentioned earlier the surround sound is amazing with accurate reproduction and smooth transmissions for sounds . Rear surround is n't as great but that is due to the nature of headphones . In conclusion , I really like the recon 3d 's capabilities and portability and would definitely recommend it to anyone . However the price may keep some from buying it . 	Xbox
I only received this yesterday , but I love it . I no longer have to waste money on batteries . It charges while the xbox is off so you can take it off the charger by the time you want to play . I do wish the wire connecting the charger to the xbox was a little longer , but it 's doable . I am going to order another one for my 2nd controller . 	Xbox
I bought this device to use with my projector as running multiple HD video cables over a 25 ' distance gets quite costly and this keeps all of the video components in the same audio rack and allows me to run just one long HD cable . Device works perfectly , sound and picture are great . As other reviews stated remote does need to be directly pointed at unit but installation was extremely easy . 	Xbox
We tried two other cheaper brands and they were junk . This keyboard feels great , works great , fits right in your lap nicely and the battery life is downright amazing . If you just want your wireless keyboard to work , get this . 	Xbox
I bought this project for my classroom after the bulb to replace my old projector was going to cost over $ 500 . As a projector it works well , but I wish I had known some things about the item before I purchased it . 1 -RRB- The projector is not very bright . As a result , the projection is not very sharp . This makes text fuzzy , so that everything has to be huge for my students to see it . 2 -RRB- The settings on this projector do little to help the image . The manual is poorly translated from Chinese and is quite funny . So it 's hard to figure out exactly what to do if you are having problems . 3 -RRB- I have to start the projector twice before it will stay on . I have no clue why it needs me to do this , but I think it has something to do with the fuse that lights the bulb . I guess it has to warm up . 4 -RRB- There is no zoom and if you can hang this from the ceiling you will be better off . Mine is stacked on 3 books on a cart . The screen is very low and the projector has to be close to project a big picture . I mean within 5 feet close , so if you want to use this with a SmartBoard make sure you have this mounted from the ceiling or be prepared for students to block projection when using the board . On the reverse , for the price this is a good projector for watching movies at home in a VERY dark room . I 'm not unsatisfied with my purchase , but if I had it to do again , I 'd probably beg for more money and get a better projector just because I 'm using this for my classroom . At home , I think this projector would work great for movies and games . The extra bulb and cords are a nice touch . If you want to do some more research before you buy , search this : HD66 LCD TV Projector 1080i HDMI No where on that projector does it say Mediawise . 	Xbox
reciever and I got this because it has a controller with it . It took a little while to find configuration software -LRB- switchblade -RRB- , and I had to pay a tiny $ 1.99 per month fee to use the most recent version . But after I got it all set up , I really liked it . I do n't have to hurt my wrist on the mouse when I play my game . 	Xbox
At first , I thought it was not going to work mostly or entirely . But , I was not disappointed when I took time figuring how to use it properly . I absolutely love it . It makes me glad that I bought and received a new one for a good price . I probably would not recommend buying an used battery for Xbox 360 wireless controller -LRB- s -RRB- . 	Xbox
I admit , I 've been loyal to Logitech for 15 years , but Logitech has made me try input peripherals from vendors . So I decided to try out this Arc Keyboard . This keyboard looks very cool , but comfort level is still far from full sized keyboard , but this keyboard is the smallest keyboard I have in my house . Keys travel shorter than I like them to be , but they are very quiet compared to Wireless Illuminate K800 keyboard . The feel and quality is good , but not great . It does n't give me cheap or sturdy feeling when holding it on hand . It does wobbles a little bit when you push down the edge , however , it does n't affect typing at all . When I type on this , the keyboard gives me sturdy feeling and does n't wobble . 	Xbox
I was hoping for an excellenet product , and in fact this controller feels very solid and durable , and performs as well as the Controller S in every game , except ... clicking the Analog Sticks down is extremely difficult when tilted , expecially the left analog stick wich does n't even clicks down in any other position that in the center , which renders it unusable in most FPS games where it 's mapped to crouching . 	Xbox
Nice device . It feels solid , the picture is perfect , and it solved my dilemma . The remote is a really nice feature , however mine does n't work . For that reason I 'm giving it 3 stars otherwise I 'd give it a 4 or 5 . 	Xbox
The ability to use portable USB flash drives to store game saves is a wonderful addition the console . This drive was picked with the xbox in mind and you know that it has all the specs and is tested to work with the console . If you buy this , you wo n't have to wonder if it will work . The problem is , for the special xbox branding , you are paying double or more what you could be paying if you choose a 16GB flash drive from another manufacturer . There is nothing wrong with the product itself , it should work great for storing game saves and content . The only problem is the price , which is too high for USB Flash memory . 	Xbox
Works perfect , Quality product and very rugged . It 's got a plastic flexible mesh around it and all the plugd fit snugly . 	Xbox
Awesome device . With the simple flip of a switch you are listing to whichever device you want . No more unplugging and plugging in stuff . Very nice design too . 	Xbox
This remote would be a lot better if logitech would actually allow you to program the remote with the full capabilities of the xbox360 . For instance the whole purpose of this remote is full control of the xbox 360 . However when you try to setup the basic macros such as listen to music or watch tv it does n't recognize the 360 with having those capabilities . There are three separate ways to listen to music through the 360 . You can plugin your ipod , you can use xbox media connect software to connect to a regular pc or you can connect to a media pc . This remote does n't recognize any of these . There is also no way to force it to use the xbox in these macros . The same problem for tv . if you have a media center pc that you want to control with the xbox to watch tv , you ca n't setup the macro . The other problem is no media center hard button . If you do n't have a media center or pc these problems may not bother you . Honestly the regular xbox controller is really the best way to control things . What is most disappointing is a software update on logitech 's part could easily solve 75 % of whats wrong with this remote . I informed logitech of these problems a few weeks ago and nothing yet . The software that comes with it is also very frustrating if it does n't correctly setup things automatically it is a nightmare to try to manually setup the remote . 	Xbox
can not communicate with sony home theater . also only plays 3d video from blu ray but does not allow internet acces thru blu ray player . Older style hdmi cable I am told by a technician 	Xbox
Wonderful product , Once you sit down to go through the process of dialing everything in it works great . Amazon shipped fast ... 	Xbox
This same 10 ' HDMI cable would have cost close to a $ 100 at Best Buy . We have used it daily for over a year and never experienced any problems . 	Xbox
This little muffin is exactly what I needed . The way my home office is set up , I use a lap desk for a portable keyboard and mouse . I needed a keyboard that was small enough to also accommodate my mouse , but large enough to work with comfortably . This is . It feels quite sturdy , it 's actually cute and I ca n't think of a single complaint . Some of the reviewers mentioned it quit working after a short time . I 'm keeping my fingers crossed that that 's not the case with mine , though I will update if necessary . Did I mention that I love it ? Yeah , I do . 	Xbox
This work right out of the box , even works well with xbox 360 . when i connected the keyboard to the computer I thought it looked small but it was rather easy to get used to . today 2\/2\/2012 I received the second one and believe this is a very good keyboard . does n't have the 9 key , but thats ok . I am not the perfect typist , the key board is smaller than the usual size one and because its smaller my two fingers do n't have to move very far around the keyboard . if I had a third computer i would buy a third keyboard . 	Xbox
This is the best possible controller for the PC that I have found thus far . I have tried many controllers that are similar to the PS2 design , but they all lacked decent button recoiling , easy to push buttons , and slimness . All other controllers I have tried are too bulky and after ~ 30 mins . my hand begins to get tired . I have played one game with it so far -LRB- Winning Eleven 9 -RRB- and it works perfectly . No lag , comfortable feel , and the buttons are easy to use especially for a fast sports game like soccer . Obviously , if you 've used the wired regular XBOX 360 controller you know this is the same thing with different packaging -LRB- and an install CD -RRB- . I highly recommend it ! 	Xbox
I tested 3-4 other controllers before finally sticking with this one . The Xbox 360 controller for the PC is basically an Xbox 360 controller with an adapter on the end of the cable so you can use it on a USB port on your PC . The controller fits nicely in your hands -LRB- mine are small\/medium hands -RRB- . All of the buttons\/controls are easy to reach and fairly well constructed . After about six months of moderate abuse , one of the trigger buttons on the front of the controller cracked at its pivot point . Of course , this was AFTER the paltry 90-day warranty from MS , so I had to look on a popular auction site to buy a used\/broken controller to part-out to repair my otherwise good controller . The included software does n't allow you to set dead zones or sensitivity , but there is a freeware piece of software out on the Internet -LRB- DXTweak2 -RRB- that will allow you to make minimal adjustments . I wish MS had put the time into releasing the software that came with its joysticks that would allow full adjustment and profile saves for each game . The included driver software does have the annoying habit of lighting up one of the four quadrants on the face of the controller to indicate which quarter of the screen you are controlling . This seems to be a holdover from the actual Xbox 360 and serves no purpose on the PC other than to annoy you in a dim\/darkened room at night . 	Xbox
This product does exactly what it says . The quality is decent , not great but Messing around with the setting really helps . I run a Windows 7 64-bit and to any people who have any doubts the only problem was the sound but the seller included a easy fix to the audio . Overall this product came fast and does what it says . 	Xbox
Item works well and fits properly . No complaints here ! I wish it came in black but for the price , I ca n't really complain . 	Xbox
Second Harmony remote I 've owned -LRB- 659 -RRB- , it 's better than the last one . Best remote brand I 've ever used , and will continue to use . One caveat , if you do n't have the XBOX 360 , get a different Harmony remote . This one has dedicated buttons for the 360 ; they can always be mapped , but for the space needed for the buttons , you lose activity buttons and a row of lcd buttons . If you have a 360 , go for it 	Xbox
This device is as advertised and works well . Build quality appears good . Connections seat solidly and do not feel loose . The remote has the functions you would expect . A pleasant plus was that the Harmony remote can be programmed from the database to run it . I have had no problems with visible or audible signal degradation with signals up to 1080i -LRB- the TV to which this connects does not do 1080p -RRB- . I would purchase this again . It has been in use here almost daily for over a month at the time of this review -LRB- 3\/9\/10 -RRB- . 	Xbox
I ca n't play every game with this controller , but it is still the best controller I have used for PC gaming . 	Xbox
For under 10 bucks , it 's what you would expect . It gives you decent quality but has an off color , sort of fuzzy look , nothing seriously annoying once you 've been playing for a few minutes . If you truly want the best out of your graphics I would look around a bit more , otherwise these work ok for the price and the purpose . 	Xbox
The Xbox flash drive was exactly as advertised . It works like a charm because it is pre-formatted . I highly recommend it ! 	Xbox
For what I paid for this refurbished remote , the performance and ease of use is astounding . This thing was a piece of cake to set up with my laptop and worked perfectly the first time it was used . The only regret I have is NOT buying one of these sooner ! I have it running a TV , AVR , Blu-ray player , satellite box and my Xbox 360 . Flawless performance and quite frankly worth buying at the retail price ! It has absolutely no indications of it being a refurbed product and looks and feels brand new . I highly recommend this product ! 	Xbox
If you are looking for a product that will help you back up your beloved VHS tapes , as I was , this is n't for you . It just kept freezing , over and over again , until I gave up . 	Xbox
"I really love this controller . The spacing of the buttons and sticks feels just right for my hands . That being said , I would warn you that it is a battle in itself to get it to work with anything . Of all my games with native gamepad support , only Halo could get the controller to work right away . The recurring problem that I expierenced was that games would recognize the trigger axis and think that it is the right thumbstick . If you want the vibrate function to work , you will need either Xpadder or the XBCD driver ; both are free , but frustrating to set up . I had a very difficult time getting XBCD to work on my Vista machine , but it works easily on XP . Microsoft should have thought ahead and released a profiler with their controller . If I had known about all trouble it is to set up this controller , I still would get it because the gameplay experience is greatly expanded . Feeling the controller rumble while stomping a Sniffer in <ahref=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0002YIUO2/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/176-6950574-0737918""> Silent Hill 4 : The Room </a> or feeling the character 's heart beat faster and faster in <ahref=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0007VUGHO/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/176-6950574-0737918""> Indigo Prophecy </a> draws me into the game much more than with the keyboard and mouse . This controller is great , and I recommend it to anyone who is looking for a gamepad . You might have to go online for help , but it 's worth it . If you are going to get a 360 controller , I recommend buying the regular one , not the one for Windows . It costs a few dollars less , and they are the exact same thing , the CD notwithstanding , and you can download the exact same drivers from Microsoft.com . Also , if you choose to use the XBCD drivers , you will not even use the drivers that come on the CD . "	Xbox
I received this as a gift . When I realized what it could do I was curious . When I hooked it it up and tried it out I was thrilled . Enough said . I definitely recommend this for anyone who loves to capture video . 	Xbox
I could not possibly say enough good things about this remote . It is marketed as just a remote capable of controlling your XBOX 360 . It is n't . It is a sleek , solid , highly-functional universal remote . I have it controlling my TV , A\/V reciever , PVR , DVD , CD Player , Bedroom TV , Bedroom DVD , and XBOX . It was MUCH easier to program than i assumed it would be . The PC software is user-friendly and guides you pretty much step-by-step thru the whole process . It is fully customizable . The coolest feature about Logitech 's new remotes are the `` Activity '' feature . It allows you to , for example , push the `` Watch DVD '' button . Your entire system will then turn on\/change for you to watch a DVD . Your TV will change inputs , your dvd player will turn on , your AV reciever will change to the appropriate setting , everything else will shut off . You could even program it to have the tray open up waiting for you to put the dvd in . It 's sick . Throw all your other remotes in a drawer . 	Xbox
This is my second attempt at a vhs\/pc capture device . After five hours of getting it to work the audio is very good and the video is crappy . It is not good enough to use . The bottom part of the screen is diffused and the hole screen distorts like tvs did in the fifties when the rabbit ears needed to be adjusted . I ca n't talk to a person at the ezcap that is normal nowadays so I 'll just e-mail them and wait a couple of weeks for them not to respond . Companies shold do what Amazon does and that is to have a LIVE person to talk to when you have a problem . 	Xbox
This is GREAT ! i ordered this to record gameplay from my xbox and make a lot of views . well , this baby got me THOUSANDS of views on MW3 glitches and stuff . I love it . very good for its price and works VERY good . For better audio , though , crack open the EASYcap and plug it in to your xbox and computer . You need to buy video cables seperatly , though . totally worth it . so ... id say ... 5 STARS !! 	Xbox
I 've been looking for a wireless mouse for a while and the Arc Touch is outstanding ! I 'm running Windows 7 pro . and setup was so easy . I plugged in the wireless adpapter and Windows 7 did the rest . It told me to reboot the pc and that was it . You bend the mouse to turn it on and that 's what I did and it 's working perfectly . It responds well . I do n't game on my pc so I 'm not sure about how well it will work with that but I ca n't see any delay in me moving or clicking on a website . I love this thing plus it looks like it 's from the future . Beautiful ! 	Xbox
"I note many people find the HD PVR to work very well for capturing video from console games and are happy with it for that purpose . I tried to use the HD PVR to watch and capture satellite and cable HDTV on my PC . Quick summery - It worked but barely and is not even close to acceptable for this use . For years I have used cable HD TV tuners designed for the PC , such as Autumnwave 's GT -LRB- now defunct -RRB- and <ahref=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002PQ4XWI/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/177-1574994-9988465""> SiliconDust HDHomeRun HDHR-T1-US Single Networked High Definition Digital Television -LRB- Windows7 Certified \/ Compatible -RRB- </a> ATSC and clear QAM tuner . These tuners provide outstanding image quality and performance , fully integrated into Windows Media Center . They work in a way indistinguishable from a hardware PVR . This week we switched our household from Comcast cable to DirecTV , so these tools became obsolete and I needed something to provide the same functionality for my PC with the new satellite box . I like to have TV in a window on the PC monitor so I can switch my attention back and forth when I want . I could use a TV or monitor with PIP , but the HD PVR offers the additional functionality of my PC cable TV tuners - recording directly to a PC HDD - obviating a PVR set top box for time-shifting . So , I bought an HD PVR from Amazon warehouse , a `` used - like new '' discounted unit that shipped and arrived quickly . It was obviously `` used '' . The original box was beaten up and the component cable was defective in one lead . However , I got it to work and tested it with my current cable HD box . The HD PVR will accept , display and record the component output of set top boxes at 1080i . Even though my new DirecTV box will output 1080p , at least on some PPV movies , and I would prefer the HD PVR did as well , I 've been watching 1080i with my cable box tuners for years with Windows Media Center -LRB- with Windows 7 version most recently -RRB- and have been extremely happy with that . So , I had hopes for the PVR . With Hauppauge 's most recent driver , the HD PVR integrates well into Windows 7 -LRB- or Vista -RRB- Media Center . I tested it with my Comcast cable box 's component video and optical audio output . It was not hard to set up and it `` worked '' . However , the HD PVR was over all unacceptable for this purpose . Here are the problems I encountered : - The image quality sucked . Even set at the best quality on my very fast system -LRB- Win 7 Ultimate with an I5-750 , 4 GB RAM , ATI 5770 , Intel SSD and Sata 3GB\/sec HDD -RRB- , the image displayed a lot of compression and deinterlacing\/motion artifacts in Win 7 Media Center that I never saw with the earlier PC cable tuners . Static screens could look very nice , but once things began to show motion , the image quality went down dramatically . I did not experience this with my PC cable tuners . UPDATE 01\/20\/11 : I 've reinstalled the HD PVR with my new satellite system . The image quality is just fine now . I 'm not sure why I had problems before . There are a few minor glitches when it is `` tuning '' and it did lock up once today -LRB- changing channels fixed that -RRB- . Anyway , image quality is no longer a complaint . - Channel changing was horribly slow . The HD PVR uses an IR blaster to control your set top box . It worked , but the HD PVR and Win 7 Media Center would blank out during the 15 seconds or so this took and display a message noting a lost and then weak signal . The set top box would change channels quickly enough , but the bulk of the 15 seconds was consumed by the HD PVR having to seemingly restart . The PC cable tuners I had used previously tuned directly and could switch channels seamlessly in a second or so . UPDATE 01\/20\/11 : While all this is true , Hauppauge has a note about it in the release notes for the Media Center driver update . The H. 264 stream has to restart when channels are changed , so there is about a 15 second lapse while it goes through this , and this triggers the weak signal warning . Too bad . It sounds like there is no hope of remedying this . - Sage TV supports the HD PVR , but I found other serious problems when I tried to use that as an alternative to Win 7 Media Center . Image quality was even worse . Sage allows some tweaking of codecs and deinterlacing . No matter how much I fiddled with that , the image quality sucked . - Pausing , rewinding , fast forward control was downright awful . Trying to use them to time-shift live TV was asking for trouble with horrible image stuttering , loss of sound , freezing . Absolutely putrid performance compared to the cable tuners like the Homerun HD which worked very well . UPDATE 01\/20\/11 : Well , this seems to have largely cleared up as well . There still are some glitches , but it is working fairly well . I could go on , but that 's enough to completely kill any hopes of using the HD PVR with cable or satellite HDTV set top boxes . -LRB- UPDATE 01\/20\/11 : I may keep it now that it is working better as a PC hard drive based satellite box PVR so I can time-shift and record shows on my PC as I wanted to do -RRB- For cable sources I strongly recommend the Silicon Dust Homerun HD which comes in single or dual tuner models . It will only tune clear QAM -LRB- unencrypted -RRB- cable channels -LRB- and over-the-air channels -RRB- . If you want to tune all cable channels , you would need something that would incorporate cablecard , like the very new Ceton InfiniTV 4 : -LRB- ... -RRB- This is similar to my experience with other Hauppauge products - the hardware boasts features that should be very useful but the implementation is significantly lacking and crude . UPDATE 01\/08\/11 : I have used this to transfer videos from my cable and satellite HD boxes . Using the component output of these boxes , the HD PVR , using the included Arcsoft software did a nice job . It captured these files at their original 1080i resolution with 5.1 DD sound , and playback of these files was flawless , especially after fiddling with the deinterlace settings in the ATI catalyst center for my ATI HD 5770 video card . I still do n't believe there is much I could do to improve its performance as a TV in Windows Media Center -LRB- see my 01\/20\/11 updates above for better news about this -RRB- , but for transferring videos , including copies of premium\/PPV files via component at up to 1080i to your HDD for playback later , this is an excellent tool . FINAL UPDATE 01\/21\/11 : Today Media Center failed to see the Hauppauge `` tuner '' in live TV mode . I ran through the setup again , but it still failed . IR blaster did not work either . It 's not stable enough for me . It 's going back . "	Xbox
I was tickled to find the Monster Cable version for only $ 24 new . A little longer than I wanted , but ca n't beat that at any price . Unit also has a digital audio output jack , but an optional adapter is required to make use of that . Comes with Monster 's usual lifetime warranty . 	Xbox
This cable is high quality and works excellent . I bought it to connect my laptop to my HDTV and it works great and it also works for my projector . Get it ! 	Xbox
I was very disappointed with this product . One of the ports stopped working shortly after I hooked it up , and then I ended up with intermittent audio signals from the other ports . My blue ray player had intermittent audio , and when I ran the optical cable directly to the device and not through the switch , not problem . Ditto with my Dish receiver . Great idea that just did n't work for me . 	Xbox
It 's like your not using one at all . All signals go thru without any problem . I have the HDMI output from my Onkyo receiver go to this device , then feed a Panasonic plasma TV and also feed a Viewsonic projector . No more pulling cables out and in between the two . I can watch either one at a time or both at once . I will be buying another for some of my other video equipment , now that I see this works so well . 	Xbox
Excellent product . Performed flawlessly and solved problems with having 3 different HD video inputs for Big Screen TV and 3 different optical audio inputs for surround sound receiver\/tuner -LRB- 6 speaker system -RRB- .

"This cable is cheaper than the official one and does the job as well , for those without HDMI or DVI . Consider if you will plug the audio directly into RCA -LRB- red\/white audio cables -RRB- speakers or if an adapter is needed to convert to a 3.5 mm stereo jack -LRB- typical earbud\/headphone connector -RRB- like this : <ahref=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000J1H4VI/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/191-6968871-6302612""> Cables To Go - 40645 - 3.5 mm Stereo Male To 2X RCA Female Adapter </a> .

Having read several good reviews on this remote , I was expecting a very good product and the Harmony 360 blew my expectations away . This is one of the best additions to my home theather - it replaced 5 remotes . The remote is very intuitive and the setup software is very user friendly . My wife has always complained about having several different -LRB- and confusing -RRB- remotes and when she got the Harmony 360 remote she did n't even have to ask how it worked . It is that easy . You just press what you want to do -LRB- Watch DVD , watch TiVo , etc -RRB- and the remote does the rest : turns on the TV , select the correct input channel\/mode , turns on the DVD player , the audio receiver and sets everything ready to go . It is also very easy to customize . You can change the default keys and assign activities to basically any key . In my opinion , it has better ergonomics than the ` peanut ' format of other Harmony remotes -LRB- 880 , 659 , 688 -RRB- and the keys are positioned in a very comfortable way . Finally , it works with Xbox 360 right out of the box . You wo n't regret this purchase . 	Xbox
My LG tv only had two HDMI ports . One on the back , and one on the side . I needed three so I ordered this switch , and I can say it 's exactly what I needed . I hooked the cable box to port # 1 , blu-ray to # 2 , and Xbox360 to # 3 . It switches automatically too . For the price , it 's well worth it . If you order this box , do n't forget to get another cable to connect from the output port to the in port on your tv . 	Xbox
My first intention was to play emulators and roms . I am so happy to have this Xbox 360 Wireless Controller for Windows . I continue to purchase a black version to play with my friends . Now I can play my favorite games in my PC , because it has plenty support in all games and emulators . 	Xbox
Received within 3 days of ordering . !! And works really great so far . Came in a brown package envelope , In a plastic bag with hard plastic coverings over hdmi ends . Definatley worth it : -RRB- 	Xbox
Just hooked up my Wii , DVD , and VCR . Worked great . The included set of RCA cables was a bit cheap , but they work fine - a little fragile , I had to squeeze one cover back on . Again , though , that 's the cables , not the unit itself . 	Xbox
I expected this battery to be just like the xbox 360 plug and play battery pack . This is not the case , this battery pack is charged by an external source only and does not charge while connected to the xbox via the plug and play cable . This is merely an inconvenience and does not reflect the quality or my experience with this seller . The battery does the job it was intended to do and does it fairly well . 	Xbox
This optical selector switch is very easy to use . This will solve practically all your problems when it comes to a lack of inputs and outputs . The ability to use this as an input or output selector makes it very useful . The `` push -- -RRB- select '' switch is good as it stops on the connection and keeps it locked in position . I would give this product five stars , but I did receive a faulty device the first try . It failed after a few weeks . It seemed to have issues keeping the amplitude for the optical devices at peak strength . I use highly-shielded fiber lines , so I ca n't comment on signal strength at range , as my furthest distance is about six feet . Great for the price and works as described . 	Xbox
There is a lot to like about this little keyboard . It takes up very little room , is unbelievably easy to install and rids your work area of those annoying cords . The only drawback I see -LRB- and it is fairly minor -RRB- is that if you are going to do a lot of heavy duty typing\/word processing , it may take a while to get used to the size , particularly if you are large of hand . There is no separate number pad , so if you need that , keep looking . Other than that , this is a great little keyboard . 	Xbox
This remote is perfect and very simple to set up . You will love it ! 	Xbox
Comes in non-descript box . The unit did not work . Could see light going in and coming out ... did not work . Had to return for refund since this device can not be replaced-in-kind . Now looking for something different . 	Xbox
Got this to play xBox on my laptop but picture quality is so bad I could only use this to shoot footage of Bigfoot . 	Xbox
It works as avertised , good quality of video and audio , hd is great , I also use it to capture video from my old camcorder to dvd and it works great 	Xbox
Pros : 1 . Easy to setup and easy to use -LRB- except if you try to record PC games -RRB- 2 . The video quality is good -LRB- not great -RRB- 3 . The device works as intended . 4 . Has component pass through so you can put it directly in line with the signal you are trying to record . This makes it great for recording from gaming consoles . 6 . Software UI is extremely intuitive . 7 . Software is light weight . 8 . All the hard work of conversion and compression of the video is done by the box itself which takes the load away from the computer so it can be used with older and slower computers . 9 . The video output is in H. 264 MP4 format which offers the best quality for a given file size and will likely be the default video standard of years to come . 10 . Works with Windows 7 Cons : 1 . I found the quality lacking for recording PC game play which is the primary purpose I purchased the device for . You can record with a high bit rate but it does n't do a good job compressing motion . A lot of information is lost in fast action scenes and the video becomes blocky . 2 . No local storage in the device . You MUST have a PC hooked up to it to record the video to . 3 . No HDMI inputs so you must have a device with component outputs -LRB- red , blue , green cable -RRB- . This means it does n't work well for recording PC games because most graphics cards in PCs do n't have component outputs anymore . This is a major negative in my opinion . 4 . Not enough video compression settings . I would have liked more control of the video compression so I could adjust the quality more . 5 . Only records up to 1080i 30fps -LRB- i = interlaced , p = progressive -RRB- so it is n't full HD capable . If this device was capable of recording unencrypted HDMI signals or DVI signals as well as the component signals , it would have a much larger customer audience . It would be used heavily by PC gamers for recording PC games and it would be used by tons of other people for recording things from the PC such as instructional videos . I really hope this feature is added in a future device . 	Xbox
A little bigger than I thought it would be but works as directed . Quick ship . 	Xbox

This is a great product . If you run out of Component Video Inputs -LRB- plus Digital Audio -RRB- - the buck stops here ! Connection is a snap and no degradation of video quality ! Could n't be better ! Anatoly , CT 	Xbox

This remote covers all the bases when it comes functionality ; TV , SATE , XBOX , DVD !!! I own a few other Logitech devices and have never been disappointed . I would most def recommend to others !!! 	Xbox
Easy to install . No Audio issues -LRB- like many people have been describing -RRB- . No hookup issues . Said one of my home tapes on VHS was copyrighted but I quickly clicked ` Capture ' again immediately after I closed out of the popup message and it recorded the entire hour long . Had it up and working within 10 minutes , if not less . The quality you get is what you output . Works for Nintendo64 , Xbox etc etc. . Using Windows 8 Consumer Edition 64bit -LRB- same permissions and setup as Win 7 -RRB- . Thanks for your product . : - -RRB- 	Xbox
This is a great product . It is the first universal remote I have owned and I love it . I use it in my media room and I have an overhead projector and the rest of my equipment is at the front of the room . I was concerned I would have to point the remote at the projector since it is in a different location from the rest of my equipment , but that is NOT the case . I just point it forward and it works great . This is a great product for the money , and I highly recommend it . 	Xbox
This is a good product that is exactly as described . The remote is n't great but I use a Harmony one with it . The seller shipped quickly . 	Xbox
sleek and well-built the keyboard looks and feels great but I do n't get the purpose . It 's too thin to be usable for everyday keyboard , horrible ergonomics . It needs trackpad or trackball to be an HTPC keyboard . So what is it ? 	Xbox
Hauupauge 1212 HD - PVR is an unreliable product . Purchase for my son in late April . Due to travel did not return in time . Power button stays hot all the time and will not turn on or off . No signal or output is provided . I would not recommend anyone purchase this product , 	Xbox
I bought a Mad Catz Xbox 360 gamepad because the official Xbox 360 controller is notorious for having a terrible directional pad . The Mad Catz model does improve slightly upon the official controller 's D-pad , but it still feels mushy , and occasionally registers inaccurate directional presses . The D-pad is stiff when pushed down , making it difficult to press in a different direction until you release it . The pad 's overall construction feels much cheaper than the official model . The plastic is not machined as smoothly and buttons do n't sit comfortably in the holes of the faceplate . Thus , they tend to stick , especially the Start and Back buttons . The analog sticks , while serviceable , became buggy over time , and after a few months of light use , my left stick sometimes got stuck registering a left push . This problem happened on both Xbox 360 and PC . Ultimately , I ca n't recommend the Mad Catz gamepad as a replacement for an official model , as its slightly more accurate D-pad is offset by generally poorer design and engineering . Try a different third-party controller instead , such as the Hori Pad EX2 Turbo , or the Saitek PP35 . -LRB- ... -RRB- 	Xbox
This is everything I always wanted , Use my console controllers on my pc !!! It is really simple , connect the wireless receiver to the pc and turn on your controller -LRB- I connect 4 xbox 360 wireless controls -RRB- and that 's it !!! In 10 min I was playing with 3 friends all night . It 's cheaper to buy this product than buy 1 regular xbox 360 wireless control and 1 wireless receiver . 	Xbox
I bought mine in May 2009 , an E1 model . It lasted 3yrs and suddenly stopped working . It is no longer recognized by the operating system and actually shows an error on the USB port it is connected to although the port is fine works with other devices . The HD-PVR was also tested on another computer with the same results , tried on original WHS , Win7 , and WHS 2011 . I also tried another power supply with the exact same specs , no difference . I opened it up and it is clean inside without any burned\/bad looking components or buldged capacitors . While it worked it was flawless , running for months at a time without any problems . I have emailed Hauppauge , but no reply yet after 3 days . I never used the included blaster , could n't get it to work , used an USB-UIRT instead . Channel changes to my Cisco RNG150 were slow but always worked . I bought a Colossus to replace it and am having a ridiculously hard time getting it to just complete a recording , most recordings fail before completion . I am using the latest software driver as of 7\/6\/2012 , tested on both WHS 2011 and Win7 , might be returning it for another HD-PVR . I had far less problems in 3 years with the HD-PVR than a few days of trying to make the Colossus work . 	Xbox
hi everyone im thinking about buying this and i was wondering if you could use this with a mac and edit pleas respond and comments would be well appreciated 	Xbox
Disregard half of the reviews below that are out-dated and state the Hauppage does not record in 5.1 audio . It does as of a recent firmware update . 	Xbox
Do n't purchase this thing ! I just unpacked and set up mine . The video signal is clear on both outputs but there is no sound on either output . I tried the suggestions from other reviews to no avail . It will be going back in the morning . 	Xbox
My wife and I recently purchased a new tv , surround sound system and an XBOX 360 . Needless to say we were happy with our setup but not happy at all with having to use 5 different remotes to change input settings on the tv , etc , etc. . I saw this remote in Best Buy and did some online research . Although it was pricey I went ahead and got it from Best Buy for 129.99 -LRB- gift cards are a wonderful excuse to buy a new toy -RRB- . I have never paid this much money for a remote and my wife was not too keen on the idea , but I will say that after just one night of use I find it well worth the money . Setting up my remote intially was a bit difficult since my Norton antivirus and firewall were not letting the computer talk to the remote via usb . Deactivating both of those solved that problem . Once the two devices were talking the setup process is easy . The program walks you through step by step what to do . After you are done telling it what you have , model numbers , inputs , etc the remote is programmed and you are off and running . The remote does what it says it will do . I now have one remot to control all of my gear and I love it . The rest of my remotes were immediatey placed in a drawer . The remote is also user configurabel so you can tell it how long you want the backlighting to stay on , etc. . If you have a 360 and other gear this is a great remote that will replace all of your other ones . 	Xbox
I purchased this remote shortly after purchasing the Xbox 360 . I have to say that this is a great remote . I have an extensive a\/v set up and this remote controls everything flawlessly . This remote is very easy to use and program via the computer with a usb cord -LRB- provided -RRB- . I had everything programmed in about 30 minutes and it could n't of been easier . Whats nice about this remote is not only the controllable functionality of the Xbox 360 but the activities that you can program . I can press the button next to the lcd window that says `` Play Xbox 360 '' . My Xbox 360 , televison and receiver all come on and switch themselves to the proper inputs and settings . The same goes if I select `` watch tivo '' , `` listen to cds '' etc. . My wife especially loves it because we were using the All For One URC-6131 . It had macros but it did n't function like this remote . She would get frustrated having to change various settings on the tv and receiver just to watch a movie or live television . All she has to do now is press one button . She is very happy with the purchase . I ordered this for the amazingly low price of $ 54.99 . I have n't seen it lower than that at all . The only reason that I did not give this 5 stars is because of the numeric buttons . I find them to be small and difficult to use if your not staring at the remote . Definately buy this remote you will be happy . 	Xbox
I absolutely LOVE this keyboard , I 've used it probably 15 minutes now typing reviews and feedback , Works awesome and I do n't feel there 's any learning curve to getting use to the key placement . I was actually seriously surprised how small the keyboard was , I imagined it was going to be a standard sized keyboard except arched . It 's deffinately portable and very clean . on the very bottom right of the keboard is a key for a toggle for 4 way arrow keys , very effective , Power button on the top left of the keyboard and even Volume up\/down\/mute top row\/right 3 seperate keys and a delete key in top right corner . I purchased the white keyboard which I find very appealing , especially with the lime green base . I only with the ESC key on the top left should be assignable so that one would be able to sleep\/hibernate\/standby etc. ... instead of shutdown . Very easy install ; simple plug and play . I actually went to the site for the keybard and installed further drivers , not sure if entirely necessarily but I 'd recommend it none the less . I find the keyboard extremely easy to type on even with its smaller footprint . Upon pushing the Volume keys , a different Volume marker appears on the bottom right of the screen , which I 'm assuming came from the software installed from the microsoft site manually ? I did not notice that prior to having the keyboard . Keys are very well spaced considering the lack of real estate avaliable for 75 seperate keys . This keyboard is worth ever penny , extremely satisfied with keyboard . To get an idea of size of keyboard , It 's the heights of a standard size Magazine -LRB- I used DJ Mag or Mixmag -RRB- and 2\/3rds width of Magazine . Extremely portable and although it 's entirely made of plastic -LRB- appearance wise -RRB- , it still feels durable enough to travel with . I will upload pictures as soon as I can . 	Xbox
"I 've had the HD PVR for a month or two now , and it has worked flawlessly . I would definitely recommend this for anyone who wants to be able to record HD signals from a set-top box . The HD video it has recorded at the ` best ' -LRB- 13.3 Mbps -RRB- setting has been awesome . The recorded video looks great on my <ahref=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001415FK4/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/180-7982686-4441061""> Samsung HL56A650 56-Inch 1080p Slim DLP HDTV </a> -LRB- shameless plug -RRB- and does n't take up that much space -LRB- Do n't have the figures handy , but I think it was about 9 GB for a 30 minute show -RRB- . As far as setup goes , it 's really easy to setup and record a show . Just unbox , install drivers and software , plug everything in , and you 're pretty much ready to go . The included software lets you schedule a recording time -LRB- and length -RRB- , watch as it records , and then playback with the included software . Software is easy to use and does n't hog too many resources . There are a few things that Hauppauge could work on though . Firstly , the software side is pretty lame . For the most part , they developed just enough software so that it works . Some ` official ' plugins for various PVR software packages would be nice though . This of course will change over time as various software matures . Currently there are many third party applications that already take care of working with the HD PVR -LRB- gbpvr , sagetv , beyondtv ? -RRB- . Also , though it comes with a remote , it does nothing unless you finagle it to work with another program . Overall , though it 's no dual tuner hd pvr , with todays Cable Companies greedier than ever , its a great solution to recording HD content . "	Xbox
Pros : - Solid construction - Several controllers can be synced to the same receiver - Interchangeable with xbox 360 controllers - Good wireless range Cons : - No way to turn off the controller without pulling the battery - Compatibility issues between DirectInput and Xinput means rumble function is absent for older games . - Driver updates are lacking 	Xbox
I have had an Arc Mouse for a while now and I saw this cheap in a store a few weeks ago , although not nearly as ridiculously cheap as it is here -LRB- but they wo n't ship outside the US -RRB- , and decided to buy one to compete the set . I 've been using it several hours a day since and I quite like it . It is comfortable and takes up very little space on my cramped desk . It took me no time at all to adjust to the curved surface and the main keys are comfortable and responsive . The top row of keys - F1 to F6 , Home , End , etc - are positive-click keys , like a phone keypad or mouse buttons . You get used to them very quickly and they work fine . Some of the peripheral keys are in non-standard places but that is something else you get used to very quickly , because the layout is still logical . Holding down the `` Fn '' key gives you access to less used keys like Print Screen and F7 to F12 , which is also easy to get used to . Less successful is the 4-way rocker pad , again like on a mobile -LRB- cell -RRB- phone , that replaces the arrow keys . It requires a kind of click and roll of the fingers and sometimes you get left and up , or right and down or whatever , at the same time . It is also completely missing the numeral pad keys . I think they could have put them in somewhere , using the `` Fn '' key , like they do with laptops , but I knew that going in so I can not complain about it now . Like the Arc Mouse , the USB receiver has a little recess in the underside and is held in there magnetically . It 's a cool feature that makes it very portable , although the receiver is so tiny that many wo n't bother to remove it from the USB socket , I would imagine . It comes with a cheap feeling carry bag , nothing like the nice suede leather pouch that comes with the Arc Mouse , but it is effective at keeping dust out . Overall , I quite like it and even though I have several full size keyboards that I am also happy with , I find myself persevering with this one because it works perfectly well . Sometimes I miss having a numeral pad but not so much that it is a deal-breaker . I thought that would get annoying after a while but I actually got used to it pretty easily . If you look at it and think it might be good , I am sure you will be happy with it . 	Xbox
I had a TV that provided 2 HDMI & 2 Component inputs but I had several component devices that I wanted to connect to my TV . I was looking for a product that provides good video quality , small in size at an affordable price . I searched and read the reviews on several products and decided on the Nyrius SW201 HD Component 3 Input Selector Switch . I have been using this product for several weeks and I 'm very satisfied with the product the only issue I have is with the remote it seems a bit flimsy and does n't always respond to button commands . This has definitely provided me the best possible solution for my video needs . 	Xbox
