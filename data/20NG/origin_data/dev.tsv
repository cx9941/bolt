Israelis top leaders in the past and present, always come acrossas arrogant with their tough talks trying to intimidate the Arabs.  The way I see it, Israelis and Arabs have not been able to achieve peaceafter almost 50 years of fighting because of the following two major reasons: 1) Arab governments are not really representative of their people, currently    most of their leaders are stupid, and/or not independent, and/or    dictators. 2) Israeli government is arrogant and none comprising.	talk.politics.mideast

She was upset because hercondition had been misdiagnosed since last fall, and she has been ill allthis time.  During her most recent doctor's appointment at her parents'HMO clinic, she said that about FORTY! x-rays were made of her kidney.When she asked why so many x-rays were being made, she was told by atechnician that they need to see the area from different views, but shesays that about five x-rays were made from EACH angle.  She couldn't helpfeeling that something must be wrong with the procedure or something.  Sheis a pre-med student and feels she could have understood what washappening if someone would have explained.  When nobody would, she gotworried.	Also, she is told that thre are 300! surgery patients ahead of herand that they cannot do surgery until August or so.

She plans tocall back her doctor's office / clinic and try to get answers to thesequestions.  But I told her I would also write in to sci.med and see what Icould find out about why there were so many x-rays and whether it seemso.k. to wait in line 3 or more months for surgery for something like thisor whether she should be looking elsewhere for her care.

It simply> means ""hang oneself"".Actually, if you do further research as to the Greek word ""apacgw,"" you willfind that it does denote success.  Those scholars did indeed have an excellentreason to assume that the suicide was successful.  As I pointed out, Irecently checked several Lexicons:	""Greek English Lexicon of the New Testament,"" Louw and Nida	""Robinson's Greek and English Lexicon of the New Testament""	""Greek English Lexicon of the New Testament,"" Grimm	""Word study Concordance,"" Tynsdale	""A Greek English Lexicon of the New Testament and other 	 early Christian Writings,"" Bauer-Arndt-Gingrich	""The New Analytical Greek Lexicon,"" PerschbacherA couple simply stated ""hanged oneself"", and a couple were more explicit and stated that ""apacgw"" means specifically ""kill yourself by hanging."" Acouple also noted that the meaning of one the root words for ""apacgw"" is""strangle, throttle or choke"" (which pretty much invalidates the guy whosuggested to David Joslin that Judas was hung upside down).  One of the bestreferences though, ""Robinson's Greek and English Lexicon of the NewTestament,"" not only stated the translation, it gave both the root words, theliteral translation, related greek words which use the same roots, and alsoother presented specific examples of the word in greek literature (to givefurther context).  The word ""apagchw"" has two root words: ""gchw"" is the ""to strangle"" root, andthe root word ""apo"" means literally ""away."" This root words is included inwords which denote a transition.  It can mean a transition in place (eg: thegreek word ""apagello"" means to send a message).  ""Apo"" can also denote achange in state and specifically the change from life to death.  Robinsonspecifically makes comparison to the word ""apokteiuo,"" which means ""to kill.""In literal meaning the word ""apacgw"" means ""to throttle, strangle to put outof the way,"" and implicitly denotes a change in life state (ie: away fromlife, to death).  So while the word ""apacgw"" does mean ""to hang,"" itspecifically denotes a death as well.  Thus Robinson is quite specific when hestate that it means ""to hang oneself, to end one's life by hanging."" He thennotes the the use of ""apacgw"" in Homers Odessy 19:230 to denote context.  Hepresents that example of ""apacgw"" as being used to explicitly mean ""suicide byhanging."" Now since there is a perfectly good word for strangling, without theadded denotation of ""death,"" and as you insist that the Bible was written byGod, and every word is precicely correct, you are stuck with the completemeaning of ""apacgw"" (ie: Since the word ""apacgw"" was used, then death isdenoted as the result). By the way, I note that Mr DeCenso also presents an example of ""apacgw"":> In the Septuagint (the Greek translation of the OT used at the time of Jesus),> it's only used in 2 Samuel 17:23 : ""Now when Ahithophel saw that his advice > was not followed, he saddled a donkey, and arose and went home to his house,> to his city. Then he put his household in order, and hanged himself, and > died; and he was buried in his father's tomb.""   ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^> ^^^^ > Notice that not only is it stated that Ahithophel ""hanged himself"" [Gr. Sept.,> APAGCHO], but it explicitly adds, ""and died"".  Here we have no doubt of the> result.> In Matthew, we are not explicitly told Judas died.Note Mr DeCenso, as you say, the Septuagint was a translation from Hebrew toGreek, and you have not shown the original meaning of the Hebrew (ie"" the theHebrew say ""and died""), and thus whether it was simply echoed in the Greek. It should also be pointed out that, regardless of the added ""and died"", thecorrect translation would still be ""apacgw,"" as the man did indeed die fromstrangulation (redundant, but correct).  Further, we have evidence that theSeptuagint was repeatedly rewritten and reedited (which included versionswhich contradicted each other), and such editing was not even necessarilyexecuted by Greeks.  Thus I am not sure that you can use the Septuagint as itnow stands, as a paragon of ancient greek.  So, what you really need to proveyour point Mr DeCenso, is an example, in ancient greek, of someone committing""apacgw"" and surviving.  Otherwise I would see you as simply making worthlessassertions without corresponding evidence. Now I would note Mr DeCenso, that everytime I go out of my way to research itone of your apparently contrived exegisis, I pretty much find it false.  Thus,I think that if you are going to add to the text, something over and abovewhat the source clearly says, then you had better have an explicit Greek orhistorical source to justify it. By the way, as to Mr Rose's statement about trees around the Potter's Field:> There are still trees around the ledges and a rocky pavement at the bottom.Unless Mr Rose can show that these trees are two thousand years old, or thatthere are 2000 year old stumps there, or has a 2 thousand year old descriptionof the area which mentions such trees, then it is inappropriate for him toassert that the present placement of trees prove the location of the trees twothousand years ago (after all, things change). Now as to your other argument, ie: that the money Judas used is not the sameas the 30 silvers:> As to your second question Mr DeCenso, you ask how we could be sure that the> money with which Judas purchased the land, was indeed for the betrayal, rather> than some other source.  I would point out that in Acts, where it specifically> mention ""the reward of iniquity"" [Acts 1:18], it also specifically mentions> what act of iniquity they were talking about (ie: Acts 1:16 ""...concerning> Judas who was guide to those who arrested Jesus."").  Now I would point out> that when the Bible describes an act of ""iniquity,"" and then immediately> discusses ""*the* reward of iniquity,"" it would be rather inane to suggest that> it was an action of iniquity other than the one discussed.""> >  > Notice that in verse 16, the word ""iniquity"" is not used.  Rather, it states> that Judas ""became a guide to those who arrested Jesus"".> But the writer DID NOT stop there...vs. 17, ""for he was numbered with us and> obtained a part in this ministry.""  What part did Judas play in their ministry?>          ^^^^^^True, Peter (or the author of Acts) does not specifically call Judas' betrayal""an iniquity,"" but for that matter, neither does John specifically call Judas'actions ""an iniquity"" either.  Further John 13:29 did not say that Judas tookthe money box, but rather said:    ""Some thought that because, Judas had the money box, Jesus was telling     him ""Buy what we need for the feast""; or that he should give something     to the poor, So after receiving the morsel he immediately went out, and     it was night.""Note that it is said that Judas left, it does not say that he took the moneybox.  Thus when I see your explanation it still seems to me you would choosethe a an unproven iniquity, mentioned by another author, in a differentbook, written at a different time, over the iniquity explicitly mentioned bythe author of acts.  I find this forced and contrived. Of course this particular argument becomes moot, since we have have seenevidence that ""apacgw"" means suicide.  You see, since Judas' hanging wassuccessful, he could not have spent the money mentioned in John 13:29, becauseMatthew and Mark explicitly say the betrayal was on the high holy day (ie:Passover), and thus he could not have spent the money before killing himselfthe next day.  Thus the money which bought the ""Field of Blood"" would have tohave been the 30 pieces of silver (Of course he got the 30 pieces of silverthat night as well, and thus couldn't have spent that either.  Oh dear, Ibelieve that the house of cards is comming down). Maybe we should at this point, discuss now whether Jesus was crucified onFriday or Saturday as that is now part of the argument about Judas.By the way, as to where the prophesy of the Potter's field came from (ie: themention of it in Matthew), you say:> Please, when we are done with this study on his death, remind me to discuss> this with you.I am reminding you now to discuss it now. It's all part of the same verse weare discussing, and I wish you would quit procrastinating and sidestepping these issues.

I would note again, that you are not stating that that Bible    is not possibly inerrant; you are stating that it *IS* inerrant.    Since you have been, by your own admission, presenting merely ""possible""    reconciliations (I of course don't rate them that highly), then the     best you can do is say that the Bible is ""possibly"" inerrant, not that     it *is* inerrant."	talk.religion.misc

My Autobahn knowledge is admittedly second-hand, but I believe>the following to be true:My knowledge about driving in the U.S. is also second-hand, but I think I cancorrect your statements about our Autobahn:>1. Drivers are much better disciplined in Europe than they are here.Oh yeah, that would be paradise... in fact, you can forget it. From all I'veheard from my U.S. relatives, drivers esp. here in Germany are much more agg-ressive, but not disciplined. One of my relatives, a L.A. resident, hired a carat the Nuernberg airport and went about 18 miles to our home. He said then thathe grew about 1 year older during this ride and swore he'd never drive a car inGermany again (this was in 1982 and he kept his promise - the situation now iseven worse as effect of the increased volume of traffic).What you mean by `better disciplined' should perhaps be considered `cautious dueto fear': When driving around here, you always *have* to take into consideration that themajority of the other drivers absolutely relies on you: They expect that nobodyfails or sleeps; many of them exploit this by driving as fast as their car cango (of course only where that is allowed, you might think - dream on :).So any mistake you make is a very high risk to your health - and if you're ex-posed to such a situation from your very first day as a driver, you learn tohandle it - or you lose... That's the way I and most people I know experience our traffic situation - whether you think this is pleasant or efficient is up to you; I think we handlea very high volume of traffic and that at high speeds with modest (compared tothe volume) and decreasing rates of lethal accidents - OTOH, more and morepeople (esp. women) dislike driving (because they feel overtaxed and threatened)and each accident is one accident too much.>2. The roads comprising the Autobahn are much better designed than>   they are here, and usually include animal fences.  This makes them>   far more predictable than most US highways.Better designed and maintained, may be - but animal fences are very rare. Auto-bahnen and many other streets have guard-rails (I hope that's the right word - a plank made from thick steel sheet fixed on uprights; it's about 2 feet high);those guard-rails are designed for keeping vehicles on the road. Smaller animalscan crawl under the plank, bigger ones can easily jump over it. The point isthat esp. larger animals are very rare in Germany; they tend also to be verytimid. Accidents caused by animals are a neglegible danger.>3. Not all of Europe is the Autobahn.  Most places in Europe have>   speed limits that aren't out-of-line with what we used to have in>   the US -- if my friends weren't lying to me they're typically not>   much higher than 120km/h.You're right (there are speed linits even on the major part of the Autobahn) -but the attitude towards driving (see above) seems to be very similar to thatin Germany (I've been in France, Switzerland, Italy, Austria, Spain, Belgium,the Netherlands) - besides that, you really can't rely on the residents abidingthe local speed limits. I've got quite a lot of practise (~120k miles) and I'mused to travel at 130 mph (FYI, with a car even smaller than a rabbit), but Iconsider driving on the highways round Paris or Milano really a thrill...>I strongly suspect you won't find a lot of Rabbit owners doing 120mph>(nearly 200km/h) on the Autobahn, but I could be wrong. ...Sorry, but you'll find quite a lot rabbit-class-car (or even smaller, mine is aPeugeot 205) owners going that fast; small cars with much HP are very `hip' overhere - and most people buying such cars aren't afraid to let them run.>                                                      ...  Some people>have no respect for their own lives.I disagree; the size or weight of a car is rather irrelevant. Formula-1 carsweigh less than 700 kg and the drivers have a chance to survive accidents at130 mph or higher - OTOH when crashing against a solid object at 130 mph,it makes no difference whether you sit in a Porsche, a Mercedes, a tank or ona bicycle: Your're dead.Bye,Stefan---Stefan Dalibor (dalibor@immd3.uni-erlangen.de)--------------------------------------------------------------------------""...And now for the next case in Kangaroo Court, I accuse you of being thereincarnation of Adolf Hitler.

There have been cheap shot artiststhrough the history of the game, but a lot of them have been talanted players.Bobby Clarke, Kenny Linsemen, Pie McKenzie, Chris Chelios etc.. but nobody has beenout right as dirty a cheapshot coward as Ulf. Violence in hockey has got to be curbedand players like (Should have been a Women) Samuelson don't belong. When playerslike Ulf, who's main purpose is to injure the better players in the league is allowedto continue, and the league won't stop it, the players should. A Christian Pro 1000aluminum stick directed at his ugly head should do the trick nicely. If the Bruins geta chance to meet Pittsburgh in the near future, you can bet Neely will have his day.The sight of watching Ulf turtle up like the coward he is, is worth almost as much as aStanely Cup. This wimp of a player almost ruined the career of one the best right wingersin the game. If you are to remove Ulf Samuelson from the lineup, the Penguins would noteven notice he's gone.

God's experience of time is so completely different from our own,since He is both within and without it.

Sort of.  For God, there is no ""before""when He did not know, so he could not have ""foreknowledge"" of our lives ora time when he could have ""predestined"" our actions.

Fuel injector cleaning is done properly with a can of injector cleaner solvent which ishooked up to the fuel system under high pressure. The car is actually run onthe solvent during the cleaning process. The equipment to properly do this ispricey, and generally not something the average home mechanic has. The solventitself is not very expensive ($5-$8) and you could probably make up a hose tofit your system and do it yourself, but I didn't tell you that... :-)Not many in-tank cleaners are worth wasting your money on. There has been a discussion of these products on here from time to time, and Chevron Techron(not Pro-Gard with Techron) is generally regarded as the best. It is, however,a bit more than $1.29 a bottle. IMHO, it will not substitute for properinjector cleaning if they are really crudded up.

"Newsgroup:rec.autosdocument_id: 102763From: welty@cabot.balltown.cma.COM (richard welty)Subject: rec.autos: Welcome to to the new readerArchive-name: rec-autos/part1[most recent changes, 15 March 1993: addition of alt.autos.karting -- rpw]               === Welcome to Rec.Autos.* ===This article is sent out automatically each month, and contains a generaldescription of the purpose of each of the automotive newsgroups, andsome suggested guidelines for discussions.  The keywords `Monthly Posting'will always appear to make killing this article easy for users ofnewsreaders with kill facilities.  This article is posted to all autosgroups, but followups are directed only to rec.autos.  If you don'tunderstand what this means, ask your system administrator for help, or atleast for copies of the newuser documentation.  Failing that, pleasesubscribe to the newsgroup news.announce.newusers and read thedocumentation provided there.Introduction to the Rec.Autos newsgroup hierarchy:rec.autos.techis intended for technical discussions of automobiles, their design,construction, diagnosis, and service.  Other discussions are largelyinappropriate, especially For Sale ads.rec.autos.sportis intended for discussion of legal, organized competition involvingautomobiles.  Technical discussions are appropriate insofar as they applyto competition vehicles.  Discussion from either of two viewpoints,spectator and participant, is encouraged.  Arguments about sports cars arelargely inappropriate, as are most other discussions.  For Sale ads areinappropriate unless they are for competition vehicles and/or equipment.Discussions of illegal events are marginal; one should probably avoidadvocating breaking the law.  (remember, the FBI reads Usenet!)rec.autos.drivingis intended for discussions related to the driving of automobiles.Also, if you must discuss 55 vs. 65, or radar detectors, or <insertyour pet driving peeve> boneheads, do it here.rec.autos.vwis intended for discussion of issues related to the use and ownershipof automobiles manufactured by Volkswagen (this includes VWs, Audis,Seats, etc.)  It was created on the grounds that the info-vw mailinglist was very successful.  It should not be presumed from the existenceof this group that it is appropriate to create many groups to cover manydifferent marques; groups specific to individual marques should only becreated on demonstration of sufficient interest, via some avenue such asa mailing list.rec.audio.caris not properly part of the rec.autos.* hierarchy.  it is, however,the correct place for discussion of automotive audio equipment, andso is mentioned here.rec.autos.antiqueis intended for the discussion of older cars (usually more than 25 yearsold, although this is not a hard-and-fast rule.)alt.hotrodis not part of the hierarchy, but also of potential interest to therec.autos reader.  it is gatewayed to the moderated hotrod mailinglist, and is for serious discussion of modifying and developingperformance vehicles.alt.autos.rod-n-customalso not part of the `official' hierarchy; devoted to that peculiarAmerican hobby of customizing older cars.alt.autos.kartingfor the discussion of the popular motorsport and hobby, karting.rec.autosis intended to capture discussion on all other automotive topics.Crossposting:Crossposting occurs when more than one newsgroup name is included onthe Newsgroups: line in the article header; such articles will appearin all of the newsgroups listed.Crossposting is one of the most misunderstood and misused facilities onUsenet.  You should only post to a group because you feel an article isappropriate; you should NEVER crosspost just to reach a particularaudience.  This distinction is subtle, but important.  Radar Detectorarticles, for example, are more-or-less appropriate in rec.autos.  They arealmost never appropriate in sci.electronics or rec.ham-radio, and the factthat you might want to reach the audience in sci.electronics orrec.ham-radio is NOT adequate justification for posting to either group.Crossposting between any or all of the rec.autos.* groups is usuallyinappropriate; if you find yourself doing so, consider whether or not it istruly advisable, before sending your article.  Consider setting Followup-To:to point to only one newsgroup if you feel you must crosspost.Crossposting between rec.autos.* and misc.consumers is chancy at best; inparticular flame wars over the speed limit in the US and/or the use ofradar detectors should NEVER be crossposted between any of these groups.Most readers of sci.electronics and rec.radio.* couldn't care less aboutthe police radar and radar detector arguments that go on endlessly inrec.autos.It is an excellent idea to check the Newsgroups: and Followup-to:  lines ofarticles before posting a followup.  In particular, be wary of posting tomisc.test, rec.arts.startrek.*, or talk.bizarre, or any combination of thesethree.  The life you save may be your own.Distribution:There is a field in the header of any news article which allows you to(partially) control where the article goes; it is called the Distributionfield.  It may be very useful for many reasons; it should also serveas a reminder that news is a very large and widespread system.The distribution of rec.autos.* is fairly extensive.  As of this writing, the Automotive newsgroups are known to reach most of Europe, Australia,New Zealand, and some locations in Japan.  With this in mind, I offer thefollowing hints about use of the Distribution: field in your articleheaders, and on article content.1) Please take care not to send for-sale ads about clapped out FordMavericks in New Jersey to France or California; i doubt that anyone ineither place will care, except for my girlfriend, who for some strangereason likes Mavericks (but only 4-door Mavericks, at that.)2) When posting technical questions, please include the market for whichyour car was manufactured.  For example, there are a number of differencesbetween a European-market Ford Escort and a US-market Escort.  Likewise,all 1750cc and early 2000cc Alfa Romeos reached the US with Spica Fuelinjection; European market cars usually got carbs (often Webers).  Thesedifferences can be important to your readers; make your situation clear.Failure to do so can lead to pointless flame wars and a significantspread of misinformation.3) Be careful about your capacities and specifications when posting;in the US we get a mix of Metric and English system values, whereasEurope is almost entirely on the Metric system.  A future editionof this monthly posting will contain a list of commonly-usedabbreviations that may not be known in some places that rec.autosreaches; this cuts both ways so let us not be parochial about it.4) Use the Distribution: field to limit where your article goes, whenpossible.  Within North America, the values na (north america), can(canada), and usa may be used.  in addition, the two-letter stateabbreviations of the US are supported in some cases; e.g. if i wantedto send an article only to New York and New Jersey, i could put""ny,nj"" in a Distribution field.  note that multiple, comma-separatedvalues are legal.  these distribution fields vary widely, however, soyou should check with your local sysadmin to find out what is likelyto be supported in your area.The Dangers of Overgeneralization:To amplify a warning from the distribution section of this article:Be wary of making foolish assumptions about all cars, tires, etc.  What istrue for a 1973 Buick with a 455cid engine may be quite utterly wrong for a1976 Honda with a 1200cc engine.  Headlight laws in Sweden are decidedlydifferent from those in Idaho.The Need for Adequate Specification:When you ask a question, please give a reasonable amount of information;e.g., if you have a question about your Honda, please specify year,model, engine size, etc.  Otherwise, most answers to your question may bequite useless.Concerning Lemons:At one time or another, every auto manufacturer has manufactured a lemon ortwo; even Honda admits to this.  Please don't waste everyone's time byannouncing to the world that your `brand x' automobile is terrible, so all`brand x' automobiles are terrible, so no one should ever buy a car fromthe `brand x' company.  Such articles are worse than useless, because theycause substantial wasted bandwidth while carrying little or no usefulinformation.Concerning Flames:As much as we might wish it, a flame-free newsgroup is something that mostlikely will never occur.  Here are some guidelines for flames and howto deal with them (a list of flame-prone topics follows in the next sectionof this posting):If you post something truly obnoxious and inflammatory, don't imagine for aminute that including the words `No Flames' will work.  It won't, andyou'll get exactly what you deserve.If you're going to flame, you're more likely to get away with it if you cancite a fact or maybe a well-known reference.  No one is likely to believebald, unsupported assertions.Be careful about who you choose to insult.  Consider not insulting anyone.Asking the Question:It is a bad idea to post a question and end it with a phrase like `Pleasesend email, I don't read this group'.  It is a much better idea toend the question with `Please send email, if there is sufficient interestI'll summarize the results in a later posting.  I may miss posted responsesto this request'.Answering the Question:If someone wants to hop up their Yugo, don't tell them to get a Mustang.Either be silent, or give them useful advice.  If someone wants advice ondefending a speeding ticket, don't tell them to obey the law next time --it's offensive, presumes guilt which is not proven, and doesn't directlyaddress the original question.  In general, don't post in order to seeyour words in print, and don't post in order to enjoy feeling smug andself-righteous.Stale and/or Inflammatory Topics:Certain topics are considered stale by `old timers'; while discussion ofthem is certainly ok, and new, factual information is welcome, ravingsabout them are extremely tiresome, and may get the person who posts themignored altogether.  Some topics are naturally inflammatory; it isdifficult if not impossible to have meaningful discussion of them.  Someof these topics include the following:1)  the 55mph speed limit in the US: Pro and Con2)  discussions about the morality and legality of the sale and usage of    radar detectors.3)  discussions over which radar detector is best.4)  discussions over what is a sports car (this is one reason why    rec.autos.sport is not a `sports car' group -- everyone would argue    about what constitutes a `sports car'.)5)  disputes over whether or not US Federal law protects the driver's    right to own and operate a radar detector6)  `Buy American' discussions7)  `clever' bumper stickers and personalized license plates8)  <insert nationality here> cars are terrible9)  What kind of car did Maxwell Smart drive?      [when I have a complete, accurate answer it will be added to the          commonly-asked questions article which is also posted monthly.

Rags strewed the mud floor around an  iron tripod over embers that vented their smoke through roof beams black  with soot. All looked bare and empty, but in an inner room flies buzzed. As  the door swung shut behind me I saw they came from a man's body lying face  up, naked but for its grimy turban. He was about fifty years old by what  was left of his face - a rifle butt had bashed an eye. The one left slanted,  as with Tartars rather than with Turks. Any uniform once on him was gone, so  I'd no proof which he was, and quickly went out, gagging at the mess of his   slashed genitals.""p. 363 (first paragraph).  'How many people lived there?' 'Oh, about eight hundred.' He yawned. 'Did you see any Turk officers?' 'No, sir. I was in at dawn. All were Tartar civilians in mufti.' ""The lieutenant dozed off, then I, but in the small hours a voice woke me -  Dro's. He stood in the starlight bawling out an officer. Anyone keelhauled so long and furiously I'd never heard. Then abruptly Dro broke into  laughter, quick and simple as child's. Both were a cover for his sense of guilt, I thought, or hoped. For somehow, despite my boast of irreligion, Christian massacring 'infidels' was more horrible than the reverse would have been. From daybreak on, Armenian villagers poured in from miles around..... The women plundered happily, chattering like ravens as they picked over the carcass of Djul. They hauled out every hovel's chattels, the last  scrap of food or cloth, and staggered away, packing pots, saddlebags,  looms, even spinning-wheels. 'Thank you for a lot, Dro,' I said to him back in camp. 'But now I must  leave.'...We shook hands, the captain said 'A bientot, mon camarade.' And  for hours the old Molokan scout and I plodded north across parching plains.  Like Lot's wife I looked back once to see smoke bathing all, doubtless in  a sack of other Moslem villages up to the line of snow that was Iran.'""p. 354.""At morning tea, Dro and his officers spread out a map of this whole high region called the Karabakh. Deep in tactics, they spoke Russian, but I got their contempt for Allied 'neutral' zones and their distrust of promises made by tribal chiefs. A campaign shaped; more raids on Moslem villages.""p. 358.""It will be three hours to take,"" Dro told me. We'd close in on three sides.""The men on foot will not shoot, but use only the bayonets,"" Merrimanovsaid, jabbing a rifle in dumbshow.""That is for morale,"" Dro put in. ""We must keep the Moslems in terror.""""Soldiers or civilians?"" I asked.""There is no difference,"" said Dro. ""All are armed, in uniform or not.""""But the women and children?""""Will fly with the others as best they may.""p. 360.""The ridges circled a wide expanse, its floors still. Hundreds of feet  down, the fog held, solid as cotton flock. 'Djul lies under that,' said  Dro, pointing. 'Our men also attack from the other sides.' Then, 'Whee-ee!' - his whistle lined up all at the rock edge. Bayonets clicked upon carbines. Over plunged Archo, his black haunches rippling; then followed the staff, the horde - nose to tail, bellies taking the spur. Armenia in action seemed more like a pageant than war, even though  I heard our Utica brass roar. As I watched from the height, it took ages for Djul to show clear. A tsing of machine-gun fire took over from the thumping batteries; cattle lowed, dogs barked, invisible, while I ate a hunk of cheese and drank from a snow puddle. Mist at last folded upward as men shouted, at first heard faintly. The came a shrill wailing. Now among the cloud-streaks rose darker wisps - smoke. Red glimmered about house walls of stone or wattle, into dry weeds on roofs. A mosque stood in clump of trees, thick and green. Through crooked alleys on fire, horsemen were galloping after figures both mounted and on foot. 'Tartarski!' shouted the gunner by me. Others pantomimed them in escape over the rocks, while one twisted a bronze shell-nose, loaded, and yanked breech-cord, firing again and again. Shots wasted, I thought, when by afternoon I looked in vain for fallen branch or body. But these shots and the white bursts of shrapnel in the gullies drowned the women's cries. At length all shooting petered out. I got on my horse and rode down toward Djul. It burned still but little flame showed now. The way was steep and  tough, through dense scrub. Finally on flatter ground I came out suddenly, through alders, on smoldering houses. Across trampled wheat my brothers-in- arms were leading off animals, several calves and a lamb.""p. 361 (fourth paragraph).""Corpses came next, the first a pretty child with straight black hair,  large eyes. She looked about twelve years old. She lay in some stubble  where meal lay scattered from the sack she'd been toting. The bayonet  had gone through her back, I judged, for blood around was scant. Between  the breasts one clot, too small for a bullet wound, crusted her homespun  dress. The next was a boy of ten or less, in rawhide jacket and knee-pants. He  lay face down in the path by several huts. One arm reached out to the  pewter bowl he'd carried, now upset upon its dough. Steel had jabbed  just below his neck, into the spine.  There were grownups, too, I saw as I led the sorrel around. Djul was  empty of the living till I looked up to see beside me Dro's German-speaking  colonel. He said all Tartars who had not escaped were dead.""p. 358. ""...more stories of Armenian murdering Turks when the czarist troops fled  north. My hosts told me of their duty here: to keep tabs on brigands,   Turkish troop shifts, hidden arms, spies - Christian, Red or Tartar -  coming in from Transcaucasus. Then they spoke of the hell that would   break loose if Versailles were to put, as threatened, the six 'Armenian'  vilayets of Turkey under the control of Erevan...  An Armenia without Armenians! Turks under Christian rule? His lips  smacked in irony under the droopy red moustache.

A continuous conductor is a good electrostatic shield.  Do you have signals on your board that needshielding rom other things?  This shielding won't do much good for magneticfields, unless you make it continuous around the circuit to be shielded,like a Faraday cage.The flip side of the coin:  if you are working with (very) high impedances,you could end up with capacitances to the gound plane that cause problems.You aren't likely to encounter this at 100Hz, but at 20kHz, it can be areal problem (one that bit me once).	sci.electronics

I have a fourteen year old daugter who experienceda seizure on November 3, 1992 at 6:45AM after eating Kellog's FrostedFlakes.  She is perfectly healthy, had never experienced anything likethis before, and there is no history of seizures in either side of thefamily.  All the tests (EEG, MRI, EKG) came out negative so the decisionwas made to do nothing and just wait to see if it happened again.Well, we were going along fine and the other morning, April 5, she hada bowl of another Kellog's frosted kind of cereal, Fruit Loops (I amembarrassed to admit that I even bought that junk but every oncein a while...) So I pour it in her bowl and think ""Oh, oh, this is thesame kind of junk she was eating when she had that seizure.""  Ten minutes later she had a full blown seizures. This was her first exposureto a sugar coated cereal since the last seizure.When I mentioned what she ate the first time as a possible reason forthe seizure the neurologist basically negated that as an idea.  Nowafter this second episode, so similar in nature to the first, evenhe is scratching his head.  Once again her EEG looks normal which Iunderstand can happen even when a person has a seizure.Once again we are waiting. I have been thinking that it would be goodto get to as large a group as possible to see if anyone has anyexperience with this kind of thing.  I know that members of the medicalcommunity are sometimes loathe to admit the importance that diet andfoods play in our general health and well-being.

Its scholarship is phony and its assertions spurious.I have not seen this book, though I have had several people quote it in support of some tendentious assertions they were making, so I have become curious about it.I don't want to malign this Hislop fellow, whoever he may be, as I have only heard the arguments at second hand, but both of the arguments seemed to turn on false etymology that SEEMED to be derived from Hislop.I would be interested in knowing more about these things. The first one claimed that the word ""church"" was derived from the Greek ""cyclos"", and that it was therefore related to the worship of ""Circe"".I don't know if Hislop is the source of this assertion, but it does seem to be based on false etymology.The second claimed an etymological relationship between ""Ishtar"" and ""Easter"", which seemed to be even more fanciful and far-fetched than some of the wilder notions of the British Israelites.Regarding the latter, as far as I have been able to find out, ""Easter"" is derived from the old English name for April - ""Eosturmonath"". The Venerable Bede mentioned that this was associated with a goddess called ""Eostre"", but apart from that reference I have not been able to find out anything more about her. It also seems that the term ""Easter"" is only used by the English and those they evangelized. The Germans, for example, also use the term ""Ostern"", but Germany was evangelized by English missionaries.So I would be interested in any evidence of ""Easter"" being used for Pascha by people who do not have any kind of connection with the ancient Anglo-Saxons and their offshoots. Such evidence might support the claims of those who appear to derive the theory from Hislop.============================================================Steve Hayes, Department of Missiology & Editorial DepartmentUniv. of South Africa, P.O.

Would you care to explain to me then, how my SoundBlaster>Pro card and my printer card are sharing IRQ 7 successfully?  I assure>you that they are both set to IRQ 7 and that I have no problem.  My>computer is a DTK 286-12 IBM clone.Running MS-DOS or a derivative OS, obviously. Please take note that thefollowing is not what exactly happens, but a slightly simplifiedexplanation.Technically, the IRQ line is only a means for the device (printeradapter, SoundBlaster, modem, hard disk, ...) to signal the CPU that""Something's happening here, please take note."" How the CPU isprogrammed to handle this signal is usually up to the operating system.In MS-DOS, the ""interrupt vector"" is used to store the address of thefunction that handles each interrupt.Now, basic DOS doesn't care whether the printer reports that it's readyto print some more stuff or not - it simply ignores the interrupt.  WhenDOS prints, it looks at the LPT buffer.  If there's a character there,wait a while and check again.  If there's not, copy a new character tothe LPT port.  Since the IRQ 7 is ignored as a printer interrupt, it'sfree for use for any other adapters - in this case, the SB. With any multitasking or otherwise advanced OS, this kind of printingapproach just doesn't work (or more precisely, it wastes a lot of CPUcycles.) Hence, you can't ""share"" the IRQ 7 with LPT1 and SB if you'rerunning Unix or OS/2 or whatnot.Another issue with the SB is that only the digitized sound usesinterrupts. When the SB plays plain music, the CPU simply tells it whatto play until told otherwise. With digitized sound the interrupt isrequired to notify the CPU when the output ends and new data isneeded.You can, however, hook two (or more) COM ports to one interrupt, but usethem only one at a time.  This is because the interrupt handling routineis same for both ports, and it can see from which port the data camefrom. This, of course, applies for some other devices (like LPT) as well.Remember, this was greatly simplified in parts, but I think gives thegeneral picture correctly enough.Cheers,--                Juha Liukkonen, aka jliukkon@cc.helsinki.fi              University of Helsinki,  Dept. of  Lost Souls           ""Trust me, I know what I'm doing."" - Sledge Hammer"	comp.sys.ibm.pc.hardware

'Professional' crackers aren;t interested in copying disks.They are programmers who get some thrill out of going through unassemblylistings of programs to disable copy protection such as serial numberdialog boxes, volume label checks, and who knows what when it comes tocomputer games.

The owners put out a statement few days ago, which they say was the first step in, you know, efforts to increase minority ownership and minority increases in management.  I think we should.  I'm encouraged by Don Baylor's appointment out in Colorado.  And I think it's time to make a move on that front.  So, I think it's a legitimate issue, and I think it's -- like I said, it's an informational picket and not an attempt to get people not to go to the game.  So, I think it's good.	     	     Q	  Do you think they're moving fast enough?	     	     THE PRESIDENT:  Well, I think that it was a good first step.  And I think you'll see some movement now.  And I think it's an issue that deserves some attention, and they're obviously going to give it some.  And I think that Reverend Jackson being out there will highlight the issue.  So I think it's fine.	     	     Q	  Mr. President, how about the logjam in the Senate on the economic stimulus plan?  Do you think they'll be able to break that and get cloture?	     	     THE PRESIDENT:  I don't know, we're working at it.  I mean, it's a classic -- there was an article in the paper today, one of the papers I saw, which pretty well summed it up.  They said, you know, this is a -- it's just a political power play.  In the Senate the majority does not rule.  It's not like the country.  It's not like the -- it's not like the House.  If the minority chooses, they can stop majority rule.  And that's what they're doing.  There are a lot of Republican senators who have told people that they might vote for the stimulus program but there's enormous partisan political pressure not to do it.  	     	     And, of course, what it means is that in this time when no new jobs are being created, even though there seems to be an economic recovery, it means that for political purposes they're willing to deny jobs to places like Baltimore and Dallas and Houston and Pittsburgh and Philadelphia and Portland and Seattle.  It's very sad.  I mean, the block grant program was designed to create jobs in a hurry based on local priorities, and it's one that the Republicans had always championed.  Just about the only Democrat champions of the program were people like me who were out there at the grassroots level, governors and senators.  I just think it's real sad that they have chosen to exert the minority muscle in a way that will keep Americans out of work.  I think it's a mistake.

You could take the same people and move them to JSC or MSFCand they could do a much better job. Why did it take a year for Reston tofinally say something about the problem? If they were on site and part of theprocess then the problem would have never gotten out of hand in the first place.There is one heck of a lot I do not know Allen, but one thing I do know is thatfor a project to be successful you must have leadership. I remember all of theturn over at Reston that kept SSF program in shambles for years do you? It islack of responsibility and leadership that is the programs problem.

(alveolus?)    So the trip from the blood vessels to the new air has to be done    by diffusion of the gas through the fluid. Apparently oxygen    tends to diffuse more readily than CO2, so even if you can get enough    oxygen in, you might not be able to get enough CO2 out.  - oxygen/CO2 capacity --- you have to be able to dissolve enough    gas per unit volume.

You, on the otherhand, do not trust them, and want to make the choice for them--whetherthey like it or not.It is also a way to avoid an inconsistency:  if you believe that you have the right to set moral standards for others and interfere in their lives, then you must, by logic, admit that other people have the same right of interference in your life.  (Yes, I know; you will say that your religion is correct and tells you thatonly agents acting in behalf of your religion have the right of interference.However, other people will say that you have misinterpreted the Word ofGod and that *they* are the actual true believers, and that you areacting on your own authority.

It's not a bad question: I don't have any refs that list this algorithmeither. But thinking about it a bit, it shouldn't be too hard.1) Take three of the points and find the plane they define as well asthe circle that they lie on (you say you have this algorithm already)2) Find the center  of this circle. The line passing through this centerperpendicular to the plane of the three points passes through the center ofthe sphere.3) Repeat with the unused point and two of the original points. Thisgives you two different lines that both pass through the sphere'sorigin. Their interection is the center of the sphere.4) the radius is easy to compute, it's just the distance from the center toany of the original points.I'll leave the math to you, but this is a workable algorithm. :-)An alternate method would be to take pairs of points: the plane formedby the perpendicular bisector of each line segment pair also contains thecenter of the sphere. Three pairs will form three planes, intersectingat a point. This might be easier to implement.-Stevespworley@netcom.com	comp.graphics

You push your body off to the left.To do this, you have to push against something, and the onlything to push against is the ground (through the bike).  Well,the apple guy (Wozniak? or was that Churchill?) says that the ground will push you right back.  So, you pushed yourself off to the left by pushing on the ground to the right, and the ground pushed back toward the left.  Well, that push is on both wheels.  The rear wheel doesn't care (unless you have serious bearing problems) (except of course on the Spagthorpe Dragonfly, whichhad the revolutionary countersteering-contra-shaft-drive rear end), but the front wheel has trail.  If the ground pushes the front wheel toward the left at the contact patch, the trail will cause the wheel to turn to the right.  Hey, there we are.

Figure.>John Stafford   Sure you can do wheelies with a shaft drive bike. I had a BMW R100RSthat was a wheelie monster! Of course it didn't have the initial powerburst to just twist it into the air - I had to pop the clutch. I alsohad to replace front fork seals a few times as well. The fairing is a bit heavy to be slamming down onto those little stantion tubes all thetime. But let me give you fair warning: I trashed the ring/pinion gearin the final drive of my K75 (I assume) doing wheelies. And this was NO cheap fix either!! There is some kind of ""slip"" device in the shaftto prevent IT from breaking. Unfortunately, it didn't save the gears!  On the topic of wheelies, the other day I saw a kid on a big Hurricanedo a ""stoppy""(?), or rear wheelie. Man, he had the rear end on this bike up about 2 feet off the ground at a traffic light. I don't recommend theseactivities anymore (now that I'm an ""old guy"" with kids of my own) butit looked damn impressive!!  If you can't keep both tires on the ground, at least have 'em pointedin that direction! :-)Cheers, B**2"	rec.motorcycles

Except when someone else has cooked a meal for me,I only eat fruit, vegetables, and whole grain or bran cereals.  Iestimate I only get about 5 to 10 percent of my calories from fat.Very little sugar or salt.Very high fiber.  Most Americans get about 10 grams.  25 to 35 arerecommended.  I get between 50 and 150.  Sometimes 200.  (I've heardof people taking fiber pills.  It seems unlikely that pills cancontain enough fiber to make a difference.  It would be about aslikely as someone getting fat by popping fat pills.  Tablets arejust too small, unless you snarf down hundreds of them daily.)My ""clean your plate"" conditioning works *for* me.  Eating the last10% takes half my eating time, and gives satiety a chance to catchup, so I don't still feel hungry and go start eating something else.I don't eat when I'm not hungry (unless I'm sure I'll get hungryshortly, and eating won't be practical then).I bike to work, 22 miles a day, year round.  Fast.  I also bike tostores, movies, and everywhere else, as I've never owned a car.I estimate this burns about 1000 calories a day.  It also helpsbuild and maintain muscle mass, prevent insulin resistance (diabetesruns in my family), and increase my metabolism.  (Even so, mymetabolism is so low that when I'm at rest I'm most comfortablewith a temperature in the 90s (F), and usually wear a sweater ifit drops to 80.)  Cycling also motivates me to avoid every excessounce.  (Cyclists routinely pay a premium for cycling products thatweigh slightly less than others.  But it's easier and cheaper to trimweight from the rider than from the vehicle.)There's no question in my mind that my metabolism is radicallydifferent from that of most people who have never been fat.  Fortunately,it isn't different in a way that precludes excellent health.Obviously, I can't swear that every obese person who does what I'vedone will have the success I did.  But I've never yet heard of one whodid try it and didn't succeed.> I think all of us cycle.  One's success depends on how large the> fluctuations in the cycle are.  Some people can cycle only 5 pounds.I'm sure everyone's weight cycles, whether or not they've ever been fat.I usually eat extremely little salt.  When I do eat something salty,my weight can increase overnight by as much as ten pounds.

The church is to last for all time.However, there are those who use the church to bolster themselves.  Thisis evident in many letters.  For instance, Paul talks about the""super-apostles"" to the Corinthians (2 Corinthians 11-12), he mentionshow people will be led away by miracles, signs, and wonders (2Thessalonians 2:9-12), he tells Timothy that it is clear that some willabandon the faith and teach lies (1 Timothy 4:1-3) and that some willsearch for teachers to suit what they want to hear (2 Timothy 4:3-4).Such passages go throughout the letters and Jesus does warn about them(Matthew 24:4-14).  But look at the promise in this last part.  Verse14:  ""And this gospel of the kingdom will be preached in the whole worldas a testimony to all nations, and then the end will come.""  Even today,there are false teachings.  I can name two which I am well familiarwith:  the non-need of baptism and the ""praying of Jesus into your lifefor salvation"".  Both are taught.  Both are DEAD wrong.  They have beentaken out of context from some verses, interpreted from others, and justplain made up.  The ONLY way Jesus taught is given in Luke 9:23-26 andLuke 14:25-33.

Armenians DO REMEMBER of the TURKISH invasion of the Greek island of>CYPRESS WHILE the world simply WATCHED. And the 'Turkish Karabag' is next. As for 'Cyprus', In 1974, Turkiye stepped into Cyprus to preserve the lives of the Turkish population there. This is nothing but a simple historical fact. Unfortunately, the intervention was too late at least for some of the victims. Mass graves containing numerous bodies of women and children already showed what fate had been planned for a peaceful minority.The problems in Cyprus have their origin in decades of oppression of the Turkish population by the Greek Cypriot officials and their violation of the co-founder status of the Turks set out in the constitution. The coup d'etat engineered by Greece in 1974 to execute a final solution to the Turkish problem was the savage blow that invoked Turkiye's intervention. Turkiye intervened reluctantly and only as a last resort after exhausting all other avenues consulting with Britain and Greece as the other two signatories to the treaty to protect the integrity of Cyprus. There simply was not any expansionist motivation in the Turkish action at all. This is in dramatic contrast to the Greek motivation which was openly expansionist, stated as 'Enosis,' union with Greece. Since the creation of independent Cyprus in 1960, the Turkish population, although smaller, legally had status as the co-founderof the republic with the Greek population.The Greek Cypriots, with the support of 'Enosis'-mindedGreeks in the mainland, have consistently ignored thatstatus and portrayed the Island as a Greek island witha minority population of Turks. The Turks of Cyprus arenot a minority in a Greek Republic and they found theonly way they could show that was to assert their autonomy in a separate republic.Turkiye is not satisfied with the status quo. She wouldrather not be involved with the island. But, given thedismal record of brutal Greek oppression of the Turkishpopulation in Cyprus, she simply cannot leave the fateof the island's Turks in the hands of the Greeks untilthe Turkish side is satisfied with whatever accordthe two communities finally reach to guarantee thathistory will not repeat itself to rob Turkish Cypriotsof their rights, liberties and their very lives.

EDT	     	     THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you very much.  The speech that Octavius gave says more than anything I will be able to say today about why it's important to give all of our young people a chance to get a work experience and to continue to learn, to merge the nature of learning and work; why it's important to honor the efforts of people like Jerry Levin and Nancye Combs and Pat Irving and all of those who are here.  	     	     I want to thank the Secretaries of Labor and Education and all the people who work with them for sponsoring this; and my good friend, Governor Wilder, for being here and for speaking; and all of the business and local community leaders from the city and county and state level from around America who are here. 	     	     This has been a pretty fun day.  (Laughter.)  I loved hearing the young people sing.  It was music to my ears because it is their future that we are really struggling about.  (Applause.)  A year and a half ago I began the quest to seek the presidency because I was concerned about their future.  Because I believe that our country, which had always been a beacon of hope for the young, had too little opportunity, was too divided among ourselves across lines of income and race and region and other ways, without a vision to take us into the future.  	     	     I entered with the hope that together we could create more opportunity and insist on much more responsibility from all of our people.  But in the process we might recreate the best of America's community, knowing that together we could always to more than we could individually and that we might secure our future.	     	     All of you here today are committed to that.  The 1,000 jobs that Jerry Levin has committed Time-Warner to is symbolic of the commitments made by many of the private sector people who are here, and those who are around the country.  The work that Nancye Combs does, and the successes of all the young people like those on this stage, and especially the eloquent statement Octavius Jeffers -- all those things show that together we know what we need to do, and we're on the right track.	     	     Last July when I was traveling across America's heartland in my luxurious bus, I visited Seneca High School in Louisville, Kentucky.  And there I met young people and business people who were participating in the Louisville Education and Employment Partnership.  I saw what Nancye Combs talked about today.  I saw how the young people were making an extra effort to succeed both in school and at work.  I saw, as I have seen many times in my own state, the principle illustrated that Octavius has talked about -- that for millions of American young people it is really an impediment to both their learning and their ability to be good workers to draw a sharp dividing line between what is work and what is learning.	     	     In the world in which we are living, the average young person will change the nature of work seven or eight times in a lifetime.  We must learn to merge the work world and the learning world much better.  And we must determine that all of our young people see the opportunities that some of them have had showcased here today.  	     	     Whether you're in business or in government or in education, you know that we have a big job to do when it comes to building a future that really, honestly includes opportunity for all of our people.  There are still a lot of people who say, well, things are pretty good here in Washington and everything's fine; the best thing we can do about this whole thing is nothing.  They all have jobs.  (Laughter.)  All the people who say that.  (Applause.)  	     	     They all have health insurance.  They all have a pretty good education.  And they all have a pretty secure knowledge that they'll be okay no matter what happens.  I say that not to be either political or unduly critical, but to point out that one of the great challenges of this age for every advanced nation -- everyone -- is to fully develop the capacities of all of its people, and then find work for them to do.	     	     All the European countries have higher unemployment rates than we do, but also stronger support systems for the unemployed.  The Japanese unemployment rate has been going up.  They're going to adopt a stimulus that, even if you count it in its most rigorous terms, is three or four times bigger than the one that I have proposed to create jobs. 	     	     In West Germany alone, the unemployment rate is now about as high as ours.  This is a big problem for advanced nations.  It costs a lot of money to add an extra employee, with a lot of pressure from low-wage producers in other countries that are growing their own economies and trying to provide new opportunity for their people.  	     	     But it is especially important for America for two reasons:  One is, we have a whole lot of folks who, unless we move aggressively, will not have the education and skills we need to be competitive and productive in a nation like this.  The second is, even if we educate them all, if there aren't jobs they will be robbed of the fruits of their educational labors.  People need to be able to work in this country.  (Applause.)	     	     We have always had some unemployment; and, indeed, some of it is normal.  You've always got some people leaving jobs and moving around the country and doing first one thing and another.  We have now, at this moment in our history, the necessity for all big organizations, including the government, to reexamine the way they are organized and who ask whether there are too many people working at some kinds of jobs.  But in the whole, we must still be able to create jobs in a country like America, to provide people with the chance to work.  	     	     It's going to be difficult for me to make the welfare reform proposals that I will make to Congress in the next couple of months -- it's going to be hard for me to make those work if, at the end of all this work, to get off welfare there isn't a job.  (Applause.)	     	     So we have two tasks.  One is to develop the capacity of the American people to perform without regard to race or income or the circumstances of their birth.  The other is to make sure that there are some opportunities for them to bring to bear for their talent and to be rewarded with a paycheck.  It is a great challenge.  I do not pretend that all of the answers are simple.  But I know if you want to ask the American people, all of them, to be more responsible, if you want to recreate a sense of community in this country that bridges the lines of race and income and region, you have got to have opportunity in that mix. 	     	     A part of our vision for America has to be a future for every young person in this country who's willing to play by the rules and work hard and strive for the end of the rainbow.  There has to be something at the end of that rainbow.  And that is what we are basically here to talk about today:  What can we all do as partners, recognizing none of us can do it alone, to develop the capacities of our people to succeed wherever they live and whatever their background.  And then, what can we do to make sure that there's something there for them to do?	     The summer jobs program we're discussing today is an integral part of that plan, because it will promote the values of work and opportunity and fairness, community.  It will put the people first, and it does have a partnership between the public and private sector.	     	     I said when I addressed the United States Congress in February on this program that I would seek to create about 700,000 extra summer jobs from government sources and then challenge the American business community to meet that target so that we can create  more than a million new summer jobs over and above what had been created before.	     	     Many, many people have responded to that challenge.  And Jerry is just a shining example of that which has been replicated in this room and around the country -- people who are going to do more than they otherwise would in the private sector to give young people a work experience.  And it is terribly important.	     	     I want to emphasize that this summer jobs program is part of an overall commitment to increase the capacity of the American people -- from retraining defense workers who lose their jobs and other adults who need to acquire new skills; to improving the transition from school to work for young people who don't go to college but do need at least two years of post-high school training either on the job or in a community college or a vocational setting, so that they can be competitive workers, making it possible for more people to go on to college who do want to go.	     	     All these things are part and parcel of a comprehensive plan.  It's also important, as I said, that we create more jobs.  The emergency jobs program that I asked the Congress to adopt would create a half a million extra jobs over the next year and a half, and that would reduce the unemployment rate by a half a percent.  It would also enable us to absorb more young people coming into the work force in jobs that otherwise will not be created.	     	      It also will help a lot of cities and counties to invest in things that need to be done at the grass-roots level --projects long delayed, water projects, sewer projects, park projects, new industries and particularly in small and medium-size communities -- a whole range of things that will improve the economy and improve the environment.  	     	     The summer jobs program is an important part of that because we have tried for the first time, through the work of the Labor Department and the Education Department and through reaching out to people like you, to make this more than just a one-shot summer jobs program; to integrate it with private sector efforts; to hopefully replicate it in each coming summer; to move these young people into further educational opportunities and to further job opportunities; and to have a strong, meaningful education component to these summer jobs -- something that the United States government has never fully emphasized before.  	     	     A lot of these young people, as you well know, because they come from difficult backgrounds, because they go to school in difficult and challenging circumstances, need extra help in building their basic skills in math and language, reasoning and in other areas.  And a lot of educational studies show that young people who have difficulty in school often forget as much as 30 percent of what they learn over the summer and then that has to be repeated the next year.  	     	     What we are trying to do here is to give people the opportunity to learn good work habits and to reinforce their learning skills and to put them together; and then, hopefully, over the next couple of years, if our entire program passes, to give every school in this country the opportunity to have a good work and learning environment.  	     	     There will be more applied academics, more opportunities for people to learn and work during the school year, so that this will not simply be an isolated moment for these young folks, but will be a part of building a whole new educational experience, a whole new work experience, and moving on a pathway to a better future.	     	     The summer jobs programs are not designed to be make-work jobs.  They're designed to make a future for the people holding the job.  And that's what they will do.  In the process, they'll help to build local communities, to strengthen local economies, to solve local problems.  Real jobs -- renovating housing, repairing public buildings, doing clerical work, providing nursing assistance in hospitals, supervising and training children at child care centers, and learning all the way.  Challenging young people to learn while they earn, but letting them earn.	     	     You know, it's very difficult to make a case to people who have never seen opportunity on their own street that they should do this, that, or the other thing if there's no evidence of the opportunity that's at the end of the effort.  I have not been sparing in going for the last year-and-a-half into places where it isn't exactly popular to say it, and say I wanted to reform the welfare system; I wanted to toughen child support; I wanted to require people to work; I was sick and tired of people being irresponsible in the use of guns on the streets, and I wanted to change all that.  But if you're going to summon people to greater responsibility, you have to reward them when they do the right thing with opportunity.  (Applause.)	     	     The young people we propose to put to work under our program will spend 90 hours learning basic skills, such as math, reading, writing -- either on the job in the classroom.  They will stretch their minds as well as work up a sweat.  They will have a sense of accomplishment.  It will literally be a summer challenge, but a challenge that will take them into a different life.	     	     So I want to ask all of you to support this effort even as I, as your President, support your effort.  At the end of the summer we will evaluate all the young people who participate.  We'll see whether they, instead of falling behind over the summer academically as too many young people do, they stayed even or moved ahead.  I suspect that they will.  	     	     This summer, Secretary Reich and Secretary Riley and I will be visiting many of your communities.  We'll really try to learn from you which of these efforts are working, what we should do next summer, how we can build it in to what goes on during the school year, how we can build in our job training efforts and the works that we do with your companies to make sense of this whole thing -- so that we maximize the impact of the taxpayer dollar and your private investments as well. 	     	     We want to honor the companies and the communities, the business leaders and the young people who do the very best jobs this summer.  And, again, I want to say to all of you in private business who have matched our effort, I thank you.  And to all of you who haven't, and those across the country who may listen or learn about this event today, I want to implore other private employers to stretch a little bit to give other young people a chance to work this summer.  I'm telling you, we cannot go through another 10 years when we don't give these children anything to say yes to.  If we exhort them to do right, we've got to be able to reward them.  (Applause.)	     	     When the other speakers were talking, I was sitting up here on the platform, listening and reveling.  And they got talking about work, and I got to thinking about all the different things I've done to make a living in my life.  When I was 13, I made a very foolish short-term business investment:  I set up a comic book stand and sold two trunks full of comic books.  Made more money than I had ever had in my life.  But if I had saved those trunks, they'd be worth $100,000 today.  (Laughter.)	     	     That does not mean young people should not be entrepreneurial.  It just means that you can't foresee a generation ahead.  I have mowed yards and cleared land and built houses and worked in body shops and the parts departments of a car dealership.  And I've done a lot of different things for a living.  Some people say I got into politics to escape work.  (Laughter.)  	     	     I learned something from every job I ever had.  But I grew up in a generation where I literally did not know a living soul without regard to race or income who wanted to work who didn't have a job.  I grew up in a generation when all you had to really say to people is, get an education and you'll be all right.  You'll get a job and you'll make more money next year than you did this year.  Now I live in a generation full of people, most of whom don't make any more money in real dollars than they did 10 years ago and they're working longer hours and they're paying more for the basics of life.  And we are now wondering whether we can create the jobs that these young people want.	     	     Now, I want to close by reemphasizing these two things:  It doesn't matter what kind of economic policies this administration pursues, or how much productivity increases there are in the private sector, if young Americans don't get a good education, don't learn how to work and can't be productive, those jobs will not be created in this country.  Machines will do the work or the work will be done off-shore by people who have the same skill levels and can work for a third or a fourth or a fifth the wages.  So nothing we can do economically will matter unless we build the skills and capacities of America's work force.  And anybody that pretends otherwise is just kidding.  	     	     On the other hand, we need to be honest.  Every wealthy country in the world, including the United States, is having difficulty creating jobs.  If I knew everything that needs to be done I'd be glad to tell you and we   could just call off the whole deliberations of Congress and everything else.  I don't have all the answers.  But I know this:  Doing nothing is not the answer.  (Applause.)	     	     And so the jobs program that I have presented to Congress, with the summer jobs, with the money for the cities and the counties, through the Community Development Program, with the infrastructure money, is a small part of a big budget.  It is an attempt to engage in an experiment to see whether or not, with the economy recovering in terms of corporate profit, we can give a little boost to it, give opportunities to young people, create a half a million jobs and maybe get the engine going again.	     	     Most of the jobs in this program are going to be jobs in the private sector, not government jobs, even though it's government money.  And the lion's share of the work in rebuilding the American economy obviously will come from the private sector.  That's the kind of system we have and it works pretty well.  	     	     But this is the challenge we have.  So I ask all of you here today to support the summer jobs program, to ask your friends and neighbors to support it, to go back home and ask your employers to make a little extra effort; to do what you can to help me pass the funds to create the 700,000 jobs that the United States government should create this summer, so that together we can have this partnership.  Because more than anything else, we have to give a future -- a future that our young people can believe in.  	     	     We need to send them a message that here in America if you study hard and work hard, if you obey the law and contribute something to your community, you will be rewarded by your country.  You can build a future from you own dreams. 	     	     That has always been the promise of America.

However, that is not whatdeath ever means in the Scriptures.  If you will study the word, you will seethat it signifies ""separation.""  Death is separation, not ceastation.  This isthe reason for the agony of the cross.  For the first time in eternity, onemember of the Godhead was separated from the other two.  I once met a young lady that was as beautiful as any model that ever lived. She was as personable as any saint ever imagined.  She was to become my""girlfriend"" for several years.  However, having been drafted, we wereseparated by distance.  To me that was a form of death.  Later, she decidedthat she couldn't wait for me to come home and bid me adue.  That to me wasdeath.  It was separation from that which had made me whole.  Death isseparation and eternal death is eternal separation from His fellowship, notbecause He chose to send you into outer darkness, but because you chose to gothere.  >> did you know that Jesus talked more>> about hell than He did about heaven!  >Thank you for this info.

I found no wisdom inthat until I had grown older and especially until I had my own children.  Hewas trying to guide me away from hurt that would enter my life if I continuedon my suicidal course.  He did it in love though I interpreted it as harsh andunloving.  If God warns of impending danger, that is love.  If choose to let usdo as we please, and then at the end tell us the rules, that would be harsh. You have a conscience, no matter how calused or fallen it is, that witnesses toyou that a thing is wrong and that there is cause for fear.  >Being Jesus was allegedly God, I doubt he could honestly feel>     the pinpricks man dealt him...This may give light to the error of your understanding.  One must have correctknowledge in order to have correct faith.  Faith and knowledge are inseparable. Jesus most certainly felt the ""pinpricks"" of life.  As the Scripture say:Heb. 4:15 For we do not have a high priest who cannot sympathize with ourweaknesses, but One who has been tempted in all things as we are, yet withoutsin.The kenosis passage of Phil 2 states that He gave up His Godhead attributeswhen He took upon Himself humanity.  It has been a favorite meditation of mineto think about this.  It was to be my PhD thesis.  ""The Consciousness ofChrist.""  I have talked at length with a great many people about thisinteresting study, including clh.  It is my conclussion that as Jesus, the 2nd member of the Trinity, actuallysuffered as we do.  He became part of the human race and experienced it as wedo.  He ""grew in knowledge.""  He chose not to grasp His omniscience, but choseto be taught.  It is my understanding that He was ""led of the Spirit"" to suchan extent that sometimes it is hard to distinquish between Jesus the man andJesus as God.  But in Jn 8 where the adulterous women was thrown before Him,the tenses are quite clear in that the whole situation took Him by surprise. That is, He was not aware that this event was to take place in time.  He wasliving sequential history as you or I.  Maybe some other time we can discuss this, but it is a very lengthy discussionand one that causes the curcuit breakers of the brain to pop more often thannot.>Thanks again for the info.  Just so you know, some friends and I>     are starting a Freethinkers organization-- and I'm going to>     use some of the info you provided for an organization intro->     duction... :-)I was once a member of that club.  THe ""free thinker"" is a glorious ideal.  Bycontrast, of course, you believe that the believer is the unforunate repositoryof everything that is dogmatic, inhibited, reactionary and repressive.  I findsuch a stance to be as amusing as it is absurd.   If the liberal humanistwishes to criticize a Christian or a Buddhist or a Marxist, that is his right. But what he must not pretend is that he was led to this solely by his ""rationaldoubt"" when in fact he was led to it by his ""faith"".  He must acknowledge thatwhile it is rational doubt for him as a ""free thinker"" to criticize theChristian, it might equally be a rational doubt for the Christian to criticizehim as a humanist.  If there is no faith, there can be no dout.  There is nofaith which cannot choose to cast doubt on some other faith.Pascal pointed out that ""sceptical arguments allow the positive to be positive. Few. . .speak dubiously of scepticism.""  The fact that skeptics are notskeptical about skepticism is further evidence that to doubt anything we mustbelieve in something else!  THe person who is skeptical toward one faith oreven most faiths, will be the devoted adherent of another.  In fact, it is ameasure of his poverty both that he is unaware of it and that he can definehimself only in negative terms, hence the term ""a""-theist.Some people claim otherwise and argue vociferously for complete skepticism.  Inmy campus ministry I ran across this more times than I care to remember. However, they disproved their own argument with every thought, every word,every point of logic that they used.  Every moment of shared communicationspeaks against their total skepticism.  Their very insistence of trying to makesense is eloquent testimony to assumptions that are powerful though silent.That is to say, that complete skepticism is impossible and limited skepticismis arbitrary.  Next time you're in a room of skeptics, yell out ""Look, your flyis undone!""  Each person chooses what he is skeptical about and what hebelieves without skepticism.  To stress this is to belabor the obvious, but itunderlines the point that no one can know exhaustively how he knows what heknows.  Pure objectivism is a myth and complete skepticism an impossiblity. The answer to this impasse lies in  a 3rd way of knowing, one which is based onpresuppositions.  But if knowledge proceeds on what must be presupposed beforeit is proved, the cover is blown on the pretentions of critical doubt, andcritical doubt depends on the idea that human knowledge is totally objectiveand neutral.  In other words, another myth.  Presuppositions my friend.  It is impossible to doubt anything unless there issomething we do not doubt -our own assumptions/presuppostions.  Even these canbe criticezed only upon the basis of other assumptions.  Presuppostitons areour silent partners in thought but their silence must not be mistaken forabsence.>  I tell you what-- if God condemns me for being honest, He is>    unworthy of my worship.  Better to burn in Hell than to>     serve a tyrant in Heaven..Of course that is hardly an original statement.  Milton coined it but it hadbeen in use for millenia.  It was even used in the first ""Highlander"" movie. But again, your presuption is based on a faulty knowledge of the character ofGod.  You are operating off of a presuppositional premise of humanistictheology, not what He has revealed of Himself through history, through Hisprophets, through His Word, and lastly, but most of all, thru His Son.  If youare to reject God's annointed savior, then reject Him from a correctunderstanding of Himself.--Rex"	soc.religion.christian

"Newsgroup:talk.politics.gunsdocument_id: 54487From: dnewcomb@whale.st.usm.edu (Donald R. Newcomb)Subject: Re: Some more about gun control...First, I would like to say how much I appreciate having so literate anderudite an individual as Mr. Rutledge with whom to discuss this topic.Frankly, most anti-RKBA posters refuse even to approach the topic ofthe original understanding of the Bill of Rights as detailed in thewritings of the era. This  is most refreshing.Second, I must apologize for leaving the discussion for several days.My brigade's quarterly drill was this weekend and I needed to attendto several matters pertaining to the State Militia.Some people seem to feel that the concept of the Militia is an anachro-nism that is out of place in the 20th century. I'm not sure the Swisswould agree and I think perhaps a discussion of how the Militia, bothorganized and unorganized, fits into the defense plans of my State,Mississippi. Please do not assume that this describes something peculiarto one southern state. For instance, the Commonwealth of Massachusettshas a well organized Militia which, members report, maintains stocksof both riot guns and machine guns. The laws of other States will varybut are probably similar.Title 35  of Mississippi Code defines our Militia as ""all able-bodiedcitizens of the state between the ages of seventeen (17) and sixty-two (62) years..."". The Militia is divided into 3 classes: The NationalGuard, the Mississippi State Guard and the unorganized Militia.  TheNational Guard is a strange sort of fish from a Constitutional perspective.It tries to be both State Militia and Federal Reserve. The discussionof this ""para-constitutional"" arrangement is quite interesting in itselfbut somewhat beyond the scope of this discussion. Suffice it that, at thisdate, the National Guard has ceased to have any Constitutional standingas anything but a Federal reserve force.Mississippi, and most other States, maintains a purely State organizedMilitia. In Mississippi this is called The State Guard. In other States it may be called something else. The State Guard exists asa cadre or training corps made up of mostly experienced officers andsenior NCOs who serve as volunteers without compensation. We drillon a monthly basis at the company and battalion level, brigade oncea quarter and have an annual drill of the whole organization. OurState-authorized cadre strength is 694. This is a skeleton of anorganization without any flesh. The muscle and sinew when needed willcome from the unorganized Militia.In time of invasion, insurrection or calamity the Governor can orderthe activation of the State Guard. When this takes place a call willfirst be made  for volunteers to fill the organization out to eitherits contingency strength of 2194 or full strength of 4910. In theevent that a sufficient number of people fail to volunteer, the lawprovides detailed instructions for the conducting of a draft of theunorganized Militia. The size of the State Guard is not specified bylaw, but rather by executive order. At one time, the organized Militiaof Mississippi consisted of 68 regiments. Needless to say, the Statedoes not have armories brimming with weapons with which to equip sucha force. The historical precedent for arming such a force is by useof mostly the private arms of the Militiamen. It is my hope that demonstrates that State Militias are far from beingthe long dead anachronisms that some may wish to claim.>No, I simple stated that the people have a right to ""join a well>organized militia.""  And I have also stated that a militia that>meets once or twice a year is clearly ""well organized.""  And this>state of readiness that I have claimed the people have a ""right"">to, is the same state of readiness expected of the militia as stated>by Hamilton. Regarding Hamilton: If you take Hamilton's opinion as being the solerepresentative of the opinions of the Founding Fathers, you will havechosen a highly skewed sample set. Hamilton was on the extreme Federalistend of the political spectrum. Others, such as Coxe and Henry, canbe chosen to represent the other end. Many contemporaries felt thatthe idea of having a standing Army of any sort or even a select Militiaor ""train bands"" were contrary to the egalitarian nature of the govern-ment they were striving to perfect. The compromise reached was toprovide for a small Army, which had to be refinanced every two years,and iron-clad protection for the Militia, which was to remain ever,""terrible and irresistible"".These protections included: State control, not Federal; limitationof Federal utilization of the Militia (i.e. execute Laws, suppressInsurrections and repel Invasions), and the Right to Keep and BearArms to prevent what the British had tried to do at Lexington.These limitations eventually proved so onerous to the Federal Govern-ment that they were skirted by the creation of the National Guard.The National Guard was created for one very simple reason: the Constitutional Militia was had proved too unreliable for fightingwars of imperial expansion. (e.g. Spanish-American War). TheConstitution provided that the Militia could only be employed bythe Federal government in very limited purposes. As far back as theWar of 1812, Militia units had refused to leave United Statesterritory to attack the enemy. Further, there was no Constitutionalauthorization for any conscription of anyone into the FederalMilitary and Militiamen were particularly protected. In all wars untilWW-I every American who left the country under arms was a volunteer.When the National Guard acts of 1903-1916 required that each newmember also enlist as a reservest in the Army, existing soldiers were""grandfathered"". At least one of these ""grandfathered"" individualsrefused to go to France in 1918 and his refusal was upheld by theFederal Courts.Mr. Rutledge has stated that the Second Amendment applies only tomembers of a ""well organized"" militia. However, the pre-Constitutionalhistory of the American Militia shows relatively few periods whenThe Militia came close to meeting either Messrs. Rutledge or Hamilton'sdefinition of ""well organized"". In the period of peace between theFrench & Indian War and The Revolution many companies simply stoppeddrilling and had to be reconstituted just prior to The Revolution.Perhaps Mr. Rutledge would care to argue that those of my ancestorswho answered the Lexington alarm had forfeited their rights becausetheir units didn't drill for a few years in the 1760s. I would notbe so bold.Again, I wish to repeat. The National Guard, for all its merits, isnot the Militia described by the Constitution  nor by Mr. Hamiltonnor by Mr. Henry nor by Mr. Coxe. The fact that the Federal Governmentand many States are delinquent in their attentions to and organizingof their Constitutional Militias  diminishes neither theirresponsibilities nor the rights of the Militia as detailed in theConstitution. Misunderstanding of the nature and purpose of the Militia is but oneerror that has crept into modern readings of the Constitution. TheConstitution prohibits States from keeping ""Troops or Ships of Warin time of Peace"". I have heard some insist this prevents States frommaintaining a Militia, but this comes about because people today do notunderstand the meanings of the words in their 18th century usage.Today we call any large vessel a ""ship"" but in the 18th century the worddescribed a particular kind of vessel.  A ""ship"" is a large vessel withthree or more masts each carrying square rigged sails. A ""brig"" has twomasts. In the contemporary usage the States were prohibited only from keepingthe largest warships of the day, those capable of global operations. Today'sequivalent might be a prohibition on the States' keeping nuclear missiles.""Troops"" at this time meant a full-time professional military organization.Any study of contemporaneous writings will bear this out. In at least one respect, I am in agreement with Mr. Rutledge; beingpersonally involved in the maintenance and advancement of The Militiaas a viable means of defense for a modern society, I am frequentlyboth bemused and saddened when friends and associates wax poetic ontheir place in the unorganized Militia and become strangely silent orscarce when invited to attend a  drill of their State's Militia.-- Donald R.

To shorten development time, Iused TeleUSE's TuNinstallAccelerators resource to install the acceleratorson the shell, and I directly invoked the Open and Quit D actions insteadof asking the pushbuttons to do it for me, but the more general approach Idescribed above should work.-- Trevor Bourget (trevor@telesoft.com)"	comp.windows.x

With my appreciation to the moderator, I believe that further elaborationis needed. This is an excerpt from an article featured in the first issueof the Copt-Net Newsletter :Under the authority of the Eastern Roman Empire of Constantinople (as opposedto the western empire of Rome), the Patriarchs and Popes of Alexandria playedleading roles in  Christian theology.  They were  invited everywhere to speakabout the Christian faith. St. Cyril, Pope of Alexandria, was the head of theEcumenical Council which was held in Ephesus in the year 430 A.D. It was saidthat the bishops of the Church of Alexandria did nothing but spend  all theirtime in meetings. This leading role, however, did not fare well when politicsstarted to intermingle with  Church affairs.  It all started when the EmperorMarcianus interfered with matters of faith in the Church. The response of St.Dioscorus, the Pope of Alexandria who was later  exiled, to this interferencewas clear: ""You have nothing to do with the Church.""  These political motivesbecame even more  apparent in Chalcedon  in 451, when the Coptic  Church  wasunfairly  accused of following  the  teachings of  Eutyches, who believed  inmonophysitism. This  doctrine maintains that the  Lord Jesus Christ  has onlyone nature, the divine, not two natures, the human as well as the divine.The Coptic  Church   has never  believed  in  monophysitism  the way   it wasportrayed in the Council of Chalcedon!  In  that Council, monophysitism meantbelieving in one  nature.  Copts   believe that the Lord   is perfect in  Hisdivinity,  and He   is perfect in  His humanity,  but  His  divinity  and Hishumanity were united in one nature called ""the nature of the incarnate word"",which was reiterated by St. Cyril of Alexandria.  Copts, thus, believe in twonatures ""human"" and   ""divine""  that are   united in   one ""without mingling,without confusion, and without alteration"" (from the  declaration of faith atthe end of the Coptic divine liturgy).  These  two  natures ""did not separatefor a moment or the twinkling of an eye"" (also from  the declaration of faithat the end of the Coptic divine liturgy).The  Coptic Church was  misunderstood in the 5th century  at the  Council  ofChalcedon.  Perhaps the Council  understood   the Church correctly, but  theywanted to exile the  Church,   to  isolate it  and to  abolish the  Egyptian,independent Pope. Despite  all of this,  the Coptic Church  has remained verystrict  and steadfast in its faith.   Whether it was   a  conspiracy from theWestern Churches to exile the Coptic Church  as a  punishment for its refusalto be politically influenced, or whether Pope Dioscurus  didn't  quite go theextra  mile to  make the  point that  Copts  are not  monophysite, the CopticChurch has always felt a mandate  to reconcile ""semantic"" differences betweenall  Christian  Churches.   This is   aptly  expressed by the  current  117thsuccessor  of  St. Mark, Pope Shenouda III:  ""To the  Coptic Church, faith ismore  important  than  anything, and   others  must know that  semantics  andterminology are of  little importance to us.""  Throughout this  century,  theCoptic Church has played  an important role  in the ecumenical  movement. TheCoptic Church is one of the founders of the World Council of Churches. It hasremained a member of that  council  since 1948 A.D.   The Coptic Church is  amember  of the all  African Council of Churches  (AACC)  and the  Middle EastCouncil of  Churches (MECC).  The Church    plays an  important role   in theChristian   movement   by   conducting dialogues   aiming  at  resolving  thetheological differences with the  Catholic, Greek Orthodox, Presbyterian, andEvangelical Churches.[...]As a final note, the Oriental Orthodox and Eastren Orthodox did signa common statement of Christology, in which the heresey of Monophysitismwas condemned. So the Coptic Orthodox Church does not believe inMonophysitism.Peace,Nabil          .-------------------------------------------------------------.         /  Nabil Ayoub                        ____/   __  /    ____/  /        /  Engine Research Center             /       /   /    /      /       /  Dept. of Mechanical Engineering    ___/    __  /    /      /      /  University of Wisconsin-Madison    /       /   |    /      /     /  Email:ayoub@erctitan.me.wisc.edu  _____/ __/   _|  _____/  /    '-------------------------------------------------------------'[As I mentioned in a brief apology, the comment quoted above from meis confused.  I appear to say that Nestorius was monophysite.  AsAndrew Byler correctly stated it, the Nestorians and monophysites wereactually opposite parties.  The point I was making, which Nabilexplains in some detail, is that some groups that have been consideredheretical probably aren't.Chalcedon was a compromise between two groups, the Alexandrians andAntiochenes.  It adopted language that was intended to be acceptableto moderates in both camps, while ruling out the extremes.  I agreethat there were extremes that were heretical.  However in the courseof the complex politics of the time, it appears that some people gotrejected who didn't intend heresy, but simply used language that wasnot understood or even was mispresented.  And some seem not to havejointed in the compromise for reasons other than doctrine.  There aregroups descended from both of the supposedly heretical camps.  Thisposting discussed the descendants of the Alexandrians.  There are alsoa remaining Nestorians.  Like some of the current so-calledmonophysites, there is reason to believe that the current so-calledNestorians are not heretical either.  They sheltered Nestorius fromwhat they saw as unfair treatment, but claim they did not adopt hisheresies, and in fact seem to follow more moderate representatives ofthe Antiochene tradition.--clh]"	soc.religion.christian

What other chemicals come up in the forensics?			Who else will be allowed to test the site?		c)  After a few minutes to hours (ifdesired, the combnation		  rate can be controlled as desired), the mixture can be made		  to become veryignitable onb exposure to a temperature		  above a certain point (a tracer round) for a certain		  heat quantity (a small explosive charge) or for a length		  of time (start a wall fire and wait).			Check your military records; look at the tapes.

"Newsgroup:talk.politics.gunsDocument_id: 53296From: rats@cbnewsc.cb.att.com (Morris the Cat)Subject: Vancouver/Seattle Study Critiques----------------------------------------------------------------------Open letter by Dr. Paul H. Blackman, Research Coordinator forNRA-ILA. NRA Official Journal 1/89.-----------------------------------------------------------------------Dear sir:By now, we are used to the New England Journal of Medicine's publicationof small-scale studies related to firearms from which conclusions aredrawn which are quantum leaps from the data, followed by announcements of momentus ""scientific"" findings. These are regularly released to the presswithout the caveats which riddle the conclusory paragraphs, andoften accompanied by an editorial calling attention to the findings.Generally, while they at least present a few interesting data, howevermeaningless, the studies misinterpret statistics, and ignore or belittleserious studies by criminologists.The latest effort -- ""Handgun Regulations, Crime, Assaults, and Homicide:A Tale of Two Cities,"" by J.H. Sloan, et al., with the accompanying editorial, ""Firearms Injuries: A Call for Science,"" by two employeesof the Centers for Disease Control (November 10), however, is an insultto the intelligence of any serious scholar in any field and have so fewdata and so many flaws that I feel compelled to write at some lengthto call attention to various major and minor failings, in no particularorder.	1. The authors misleadingly cite Wright, et al. (Ref. 1) to 	support the statement that ""some have argued that restricting	access to handguns could substantially reduce our annual rate	of homicide."" Wright, et al., in fact studied and rejected that	contention.		2. The authors pretended that Vancouver and Seattle are very	similar cities with similar economic circumstances, histories,	demographic characteristics, and the like. In fact, the cities	are very different with very different demographic characteristics	which appear to explain completely the higher homicide rate in	Seattle. Both cities are over three-forths non-Hispanic white	and *the non-Hispanic white homicide rates are reported to be	the same in Seattle and Vancouver*. It is the different back-	grounds, problems, circumstances, and behaviors of the various	ethnic minorities which explain the difference in homicide.		3. The authors pretend they are evaluating Canada's gun law,	compared to Washington State's. But they do not examine at all	the situation in Vancouver prior to the gun law taking effect	in 1978. As it happens, in the three years prior to that (1975-	1977), Vancouver averaged 23 homicides per year, one-eighth	involving handguns, (Ref. 2) and in the seven years of the NEJM	article there were 29 homicides per year, one-eigth involving	handguns. Surely even the medical profession recognizes that	one must look to see the prior situation was before concluding	that a change made a difference? Would a physician conclude that	a patient was benefiting from eating oat bran muffin each day	for seven years because his cholesterol level was 200 without	at least seeing if it was 180 before he started the regimen?		4. The authors pick two medium-sized cities to evaluate a national	gun law. Nothing can be learned from such a tiny and arbitrarily	selected sample. Seattle appears to have been selected because	it was convienient for the authors rather than for any scientific	reason. Would physicians call something a scientific study which	involved one experimental subject and one dissimilar ""control""?	Had different arbitrarily selected cities been chosen, opposite	""scientific"" conclusions would follow: Vancouver's homicide	rate *exceeds* that of such ""wild west"" cities in Texas as	El Paso, Corpus Christi, Austen, and, in Colorado, Colorado	Springs. (Ref. 3)		5. The authors fail to clearly demonstrate that firearms or	handguns ""are far more commonly owned in Seattle than in	Vancouver."" They use two surrogate approaches in pretending	to study the availability of firearms/handguns. The first is	an apples-and-oranges effort to compare the number of carry	permits in Seattle to the number of registered handguns in	Vancouver. But the number clearly understates the number of	handguns in Seattle, and counts primarily *protective* handgun	owners. The second, however, tells nothing about the number	of handguns in Vancouver, and counts *non-protective* handguns	for the most part. Where is it difficult to obtain handguns	legally for protection, registration figures are	meaningless. There are 66,000 registered handguns in New York	City (New York Daily News, Sept. 27, 1987). Comparing the two,	that method suggests about 930 handguns per 100,000 population	in New York City compared to 960 in Vancouver, meaning Vancouver	has a greater ""prevalence of weapons"" than New York City.		The second method of measuring gun density is ""Cook's gun	prevalence index, a previously validated measure of intercity	differences."" But the validation was by Cook of his own	theory. (Ref. 4) Normally, second opinions are sought from a	different doctor. More significantly, the Cook index is	based on the average of the percentage of firearms involvement	in suicide and homicide. So the authors are basically taking	a measure of misuse. Unsurprisingly, gun misuse in homicide	(42% in Seattle, 14% in Vancouver) is related to gun misuse in	homicide plus suicide, divided by two (41% in Seattle, 12% in	Vancouver). The authors are not measuring the relative avail-	ability of firearms, or of handguns, in Seattle and	Vancouver.		6. The authors misstate the laws of both Washington and	Canada. They neglect to mention the significant fact that	Washington has a waiting period and background check prior to	the purchase of a handgun, and that provisions exist in Canadian	law for owning and carrying handguns for personal	protection. The authors also make it appear that it is more	difficult to get a handgun legally in Canada than is actually	the case.		7. The authors ignore all other factors which might explain	the differences in crime rate, beyond some vague mention of the	penalities provided by law and the roughest of estimates of 	clearence for one particular offense -- homicide involving a	firearm. There is no measure of: the differences in the number	of law enforcement officers; their aggressiveness in making	arrests for gun law violations in the two jurisdictions; arrest	rates for other offenses; conviction rates; actual sentences	imposed for gun-related crimes, violent crimes without guns,	or gun law violations; or incarceration rates. Whereas social	scientists would attempt to measure and hold for such differences,	the authors of the NEJM ""tale of two cities"" fail even to mention	most factors related to crime control.		8. The authors dismiss claims that handguns are an effective	means for protection unless the criminal is killed. Such is not	the case. Criminologists (Ref. 5-8) have found that almost	650,000 Americans annually use handguns for protection from	criminals, and that using a gun for protection reduces the	liklihood that a crime -- rape, robbery, assault -- will be	completed by the criminal and reduces the likelihood of injury	to the victim. It is interesting, nonetheless, that the authors	reported the same number (four) of civilian justifiable homicides	without firearms in each city but that less restrictive Seattle	accounted for 100% of the reported civilian justifiable homicides	involving firearms.		9. The Centers for Disease Control, which funded the ""study,""	editorially praised the paper, (Ref. 9) saying it ""applied	scientific methods to examine a focus of contention betweeb	advocates of stricter regulation of firearms, particularly	handguns."" There is nothing in the paper which could possibly	be mistaken for ""scientific methods"" by a sociologists or	criminologists. The Vancouver-Seattle ""study"" is the equivolent	of testing an experimental drug to control hypertension by finding	two ordinary-looking middle-class white males, one aged 25	and the other 40, and without first taking their vital signs,	administering the experimental drug to the 25-year-old while	giving the 40-year-old a placebo, then taking their blood pressure	and, on finding the younger man had a lower blood pressure, 	announcing in a ""special article"" a new medical breakthrough.	It would be nice to think that such a ""study"" would neither be	funded by the CDC or printed by the NEJM.		Since the longstanding anti-gun biases of the NEJM and the CDC	make them willing to present shoddy research as ""scientific	breakthroughs"" in ""special articles"" and editorials relating	to firearms, we are obligated to correct the record by notifying	the news media and those with congressional and executive oversight	over the activities of the Centers for Disease Control about	the distortions contained in ""Handgun Regulations, Crime, Assaults,	and Homicides: A Tale of Two Cities"" and ""Firearm Injuries: A Call	for Science."" Clearly, all scientific standards go by the wayside	whenever the CDC and the New England Journal of Medicine seize	an opportunity to attack firearms ownership in America.					REFERENCES1.

Wright          (from July 1989 issue of REASON, Free Minds & Free Markets)      Someone once wrote: ""Statistics are like a bikini.  What they real is   suggestive, but what they conceal is vital.""  The problem is demonstrated   by the most recent entry in a long line of scientific research purporting   to show a causal link between gun availability and homicide.  Funded by   the federal government and published last year in the New England Journal   of Medicine, the study compared homicide rates in Seattle and Vancouver and   suggested that a handgun ban ""may reduce the rate of homicide in a    community.""      The nine medical doctors who published ""Handgun Regulations, Crime,   Assaults, and Homicide"" essentially reasoned in three steps: (1) Despite   many historical, social, and demographic similarities, (2) Vancouver   has a markedly lower homicide rate (3) because its stricter gun regulations   make guns less available.  The second step in their reasoning seems   indisputable.  The overall homicide rate in Seattle (for the period   1980-86) was 11.3 per 100,000 popuation, compared with 6.9 in Vancouver.   Homicide is definitely more common in Seattle.  The question then becomes,   Why?      The authors present a believable although not entirely accurate case   to support the notion, as claimed in the third step of their reasoning,   that Vancouver's handgun regulations are much more stringent.  But their   evidence on the difference in gun *availabilty* is indirect and    unpersuasive; indeed, they acknowledge that direct evidence on the point   does not exist.  They offer two fragments of inferential data in support   of the claim that guns are more available in Seattle; but for all anybody   knows as a matter of empirical fact, the opposite could be true.  We   are therefore being asked, at the conclusion of the study, to believe that   a difference in gun availability explains the difference in homicide rates   when a difference in gun availability has not itself been established.      Indeed, the situation is even more troublesome.  The first of the two   indirect bits of evidence is a difference between the number of concealed-   weapons permits issued in Seattle and the number of restricted-weapons   permits issued in Vancouver.  Differences between the two cities in the   permit regulations render these two numbers strictly noncomparable.*     The second bit of evidence is ""Cook's gun prevalence index,"" which stands*  at 41 percent for Seattle but only 12 percent for Vancouver.  Cook's index*  however, does not measure the relative prevalence of gun ownership in *  various cities.  It measures gun misuse--it is an average of the percentage*  of homicides and suicides involving firearms.*     In the present case, the index shows only that in homicides and suicides,*  firearms are more likely to be used in Seatte than in Vancouver.  To take*  Cook's index as a measure of general firearms availability, it must be*  assumed that the proportional involvement of guns in homicides and suicides*  is directly related to their relative availability in the general *  population.  But this is exactly what the authors are seeking to prove. To*  assume what one is seeking to prove, then to ""prove"" it on the basis of*  that assumption does ot constitute scientific evidence for anything.      Even if we were to grant, on the basis of no compelling evidence, that   guns are less common in Vancouver, we might still question what causes what.   The authors attribute Seattle's higher crime rate to a higher rate of gun   ownership.  But it might well be argued that low crime or homicide rates   reduce the motivation for average citizens to obtain guns--in other words,   that crime rates explain the variation in gun ownership, not vice versa.      In fact, it was once commonly argued that Great Britain's low rate of   violent crime was a function of that nation's strict gun laws and the    consequent low rate of gun ownership--until British researcher Colin    Greenwood found that Great Britain had enjoyed low rates of violent crime   for many decades before strict firearms controls were enacted.  To invoke   an ancient methodological saw, correlation is not cause.      Nor do the problems with this study end with its lack of direct data   on gun ownership.  The authors say Seattle and Vancouver are ""similar in   many ways,"" implying that they differ mainly in gun availability, gun-law   stringency, and crime rates.  This is an evident attempt to establish   the ceteris paribus condition of a sound scientific analysis--that ""all   else is equal"" among things being compared.*     Clearly the two cities are similar in some ways, but a closer look *  reveals differences in ways that are relevant to their respective crime*  or homicide rates.  The cities are closely matched in what percentage*  of their population is white (79 percent and 76 percent).  But Seattle*  is about 10 percent black, while Vancouver is less than 0.5 percent.*  Vancouver's minority population is overwhelmingly Asian.  So although the*  authors show that th two cities are approximately comparable on a half-*  dozen readily available demographic indicators, they have not shown*  that all potentially relevant sources of variation have been ruled out.*     In fact, the differences in racial compositions of the two cities is*  particularly relevant in light of the study's breakdown of homicide rates*  according to the race of the victim.  For the white majority, the homicide*  rates are nearly identical--6.2 per 100,000 in Seattle, 6.4 in Vancouver.*  The differing overall homicide rates in the two cities are therefore due*  entirely to vastly different rates among racial minorities.  For blacks,*  the observed difference in homicide rate is 36.6 to 9.5 and for Hispanics*  26.9 to 7.9.  (Methodoligical complexities render the Asian comparison*  problematic, but it too is higher in Seattle than in Vancouver.)  Racial*  minorities are much more likely to be the victims of homicide in Seattle*  than in Vancouver; the white majority is equally likely to be slain*  in either city.      Since the nearly 2:1 initial difference in homicide reates between the   cities is due exclusively to 3:1 or 4:1 differences between minority    groups, it is fair to ask why postulated difference in ""gun availability""   (or gun-law strigency) would matter so dramatically to minorities but not   matter at all to whites.  Can differential gun availability explain why   blacks and Hispanics--but not whites--are so much more likely to be killed   in Seattle than in Vancouver?  (Studies in the United States, incidentally,   do not show large or consistent racial differences in gun ownership.)      Or are other explanations more plausible?  Could the disparity between   Canadian and American rates of poverty among racial minorities have    anything to do with it?  What are the relative rates of drug or alcohol    abuse?  Of homelessness among each cty's minority population?  (The city   of Seattle runs the largest shelter for homeless men west of the    Mississippi.)  Unemployment among young, central-city, nonwhite men in the   United States usually exceeds 40 percent.  What is the comparable Canadian   percentage?      The crucial point is that Canada and the United States differ in many   ways, as do cities and population subgroups with the two countries.  Absent   more detailed analysis, nearly any of these ""many ways"" might explain part   or all of the difference in homicide rates.  In gross comparisons such   as those between Seattle and Vancouver, all else is *not* equal.*     The authors of this study acknowledge that racial patterns in homicide*  result in a ""complex picture.""  They do not acknowledge that the ensuing*  complexities seriously undercut the main thrust of their argument.  They*  also acknowledge that ""socio-economic status is probably an important*  confounding factor in our comparison,"" remarking further that ""blacks   *  in Vancouver had a slightly higher mean income in 1981 than the rest of*  Vancouver's population.""  Given the evidence presented in the article,*  it is possible that all of the difference in homicide rates between Seattle*  and Vancouver results from greater proverty among Seattle's racial*  minorities.  But the authors pay no further attention to this possibility,*  since ""detailed information about household incomes according to race*  is not available for Vancouver.""      The largely insurmountable methodological difficulties confronted in    gross comparative studies of this sort can be illustrated with as simple   example.  If one were to take all U.S. couties and compare them in terms   of (1) pervalence of gun ownership and (2) crime or homicide rates, one    would find an astonishing pattern: Counties with more guns have less crime.   Would one conclude from this evidence alone that guns actually reduce    crime?  Or would one insist that other variables also be taken into   account?  In this example, the ""hidden variable"" is city size: Guns are   more common in small towns and rural areas, whereas crime is a big-city   problem.  If researchers failed to anticipate this variable, or lacked the   appropriate data to examine its possible consequences, they coud be very   seriously misled.  In the study at hand, the authors matched two cities   for size but not for minority poverty rates or other hidden variables,   and their results are impossible to interpret.      In the editorial ""Firearm Injuries: A Call for Science"" accompanying   the study, two officials from the Centers for Disease Control lauded the   authors for applying ""scientific methods"" to a problem of grave public   heath significance.  But in attempting to draw causal conclusions from   nonexperimental research, the essence of scientific method is to anticipate   plausible alternative explanations for the results and try to rule them   out.  Absent such effort, the results may well seem scientific but are   little more than polemics masquerading as serious research.  That this   study is but one of a number of recent efforts--all employing practical   identical research designs and published in leading scientific journals--   is cause for further concern.

He obviouslydidn't even consult with the Macedonians...he was just looking atthe map of the former Yugoslavia for the safest place to put American troops so he could say to the Europeans...hey, look, wehave troops on the ground in the former Yugoslavia too...now letme bomb so I can make it look like I am doing something in theAmerican media. The problem is that the blue berets in Bosnia are dead meat ifClinton starts bombing, but Clinton doesn't have the courage toask that the blue berets leave, because then he becomes primarilyresponsible to the Bosnian policy of the UN and the allies.Clinton wants to have his cake and eat it too...he wants to feelfree to use American military power for the sake of domesticUS politics and his domestic image, but he doesn't want to assumethe primary international leadership role in the UN and amongthe allies, like Bush, for all his faults, did in the Gulf War...because with leadership comes responsibility, and Clinton seemsto want to retain the Europeans as scapegoats.Clinton wants to leave the Europeans in charge and responsible,but wants to freelance on the side...and if his freelancing getstoo hot, he wants to be able to cut and run...the American public maybe easily fooled...European leaders aren't.Gerald	talk.politics.mideast

If I forgot or botched yourfavorite acronym, please let me know!  Also, if there's an acronym *not*on this list that confuses you, drop me a line, and if I can figureit out, I'll add it to the list.Note that this is intended to be a reference for *frequently seen*acronyms, and is most emphatically *not* encyclopedic.  If I incorporatedevery acronym I ever saw, I'd soon run out of disk space!  :-)The list will be posted at regular intervals, every 30 days.  Allcomments regarding it are welcome; I'm reachable as bradfrd2@ncar.ucar.edu.Note that this just tells what the acronyms stand for -- you're on yourown for figuring out what they *mean*!  Note also that the total number ofacronyms in use far exceeds what I can list; special-purpose acronyms thatare essentially always explained as they're introduced are omitted.Further, some acronyms stand for more than one thing; as of Edition 3 ofthe list, these acronyms appear on multiple lines, unless they're simplydifferent ways of referring to the same thing.Thanks to everybody who's sent suggestions since the first version ofthe list, and especially to Garrett A. Wollman (wollman@griffin.uvm.edu),who is maintaining an independent list, somewhat more verbose incharacter than mine, and to Daniel Fischer (dfi@specklec.mpifr-bonn.mpg.de),who is maintaining a truly HUGE list (535 at last count) of acronyms andterms, mostly in German (which I read, fortunately).Special thanks this time to Ken Hollis at NASA, who sent me a copy of NASAReference Publication 1059 Revised: _Space Transportation System andAssociated Payloads: Glossary, Acronyms, and Abbreviations_, a trulymammoth tome -- almost 300 pages of TLAs.Special Bonus!

However, theconcept of a prize for a difficult goal is done for different reasons, I suspect.  I'm not aware that Mr Orteig received any significant economic benefit from Lindbergh's flight.  Modern analogies, such as the prize for ahuman powered helicopter face similar arguments.  There is little economicbenefit in such a thing.  The advantage comes in the new approaches developedand the fact that a prize will frequently generate far more work than the equivalent amount of direct investment would.  A person who puts up $ X billionfor a moon base is much more likely to do it because they want to see it donethan because they expect to make money off the deal.-- Josh Hopkins                                          jbh55289@uxa.cso.uiuc.edu		    ""Find a way or make one.""	             -attributed to Hannibal"	sci.space

He stressed howlikely it was the the Branch Davidians would commit mass suicide.  Hewas concerned with the safety of the children. What did the FBI do to defuse the situation,  Did they try to reassureKoresh?  DId the FBI offer medical assistance to the BD?  Did the FBIoffer them a supply of water when the BD pump stoped working?  Did thepermit Koresh to communicate with anyone outside the compound? What the FBI did was harass the Branch Davidians as much as possible.They kept powerful lights shining on the compound, shut off theirelectrical power, put their pump out of action, assaulted their earswith loud noise, cut off their communication with the outside and keptlimiting their permitter.  The stated goal was to put pressure onDavid Koresh. Was the FBI attempting to get Koresh to surrender or were they hopingto get Koresh so mad that he and some of his followers would attackthe the tanks. It appears that the tactics employed by the FBI did drive Koresh overthe edge.  The blame for the deaths should be shared by both thefederal experts whose tactics drove Koresh over the edge and the foolsat the ATF who planed the raid. Stupidity and incompetence of the BATF and the FBI leadership haveresulted in the needless death of 90 innocent people.

Bussard, Journal of	Propulsion and Power, Vol. 6, No. 5, Sept.-Oct. 1990	    Fusion rocket engines are analyzed as electric propulsion	    systems, with propulsion thrust-power-input-power ratio (the	    thrust-power ""gain"" G(t)) much greater than unity. Gain values	    of conventional (solar, fission) electric propulsion systems are	    always quite small (e.g., G(t)<0.8). With these, ""high-thrust""	    interplanetary flight is not possible, because system	    acceleration (a(t)) capabilities are always less than the local	    gravitational acceleration. In contrast, gain values 50-100	    times higher are found for some fusion concepts, which offer	    ""high-thrust"" flight capability. One performance example shows a	    53.3 day (34.4 powered; 18.9 coast), one-way transit time with	    19% payload for a single-stage Earth/Mars vehicle. Another shows	    the potential for high acceleration (a(t)=0.55g(o)) flight in	    Earth/moon space.

[This is an introduction to the application of Bussard's version	    of the Farnsworth/Hirsch electrostatic confinement fusion	    technology to propulsion. 1500<Isp<5000 sec. Farnsworth/Hirsch	    demonstrated a 10**10 neutron flux with their device back in	    1969 but it was dropped when panic ensued over the surprising	    stability of the Soviet Tokamak. Hirsch, responsible for the	    panic, has recently recanted and is back working on QED. -- Jim	    Bowery]	""PLASMAKtm Star Power for Energy Intensive Space Applications"", by	Paul M. Koloc, Eight ANS Topical Meeting on Technology of Fusion	Energy, special issue FUSION TECHNOLOGY, March 1989.	    Aneutronic energy (fusion with little or negligible neutron	    flux) requires plasma pressures and stable confinement times	    larger than can be delivered by current approaches. If plasma	    pressures appropriate to burn times on the order of milliseconds	    could be achieved in aneutronic fuels, then high power densities	    and very compact, realtively clean burning engines for space and	    other special applications would be at hand. The PLASMAKtm	    innovation will make this possible; its unique pressure	    efficient structure, exceptional stability, fluid-mechanically	    compressible Mantle and direct inductive MHD electric power	    conversion advantages are described. Peak burn densities of tens	    of megawats per cc give it compactness even in the	    multi-gigawatt electric output size. Engineering advantages	    indicate a rapid development schedule at very modest cost. [I	    strongly recommend that people take this guy seriously. Bob	    Hirsch, the primary proponent of the Tokamak, has recently	    declared Koloc's PLASMAKtm precursor, the spheromak, to be one	    of 3 promising fusion technologies that should be pursued rather	    than Tokamak. Aside from the preceeding appeal to authority, the	    PLASMAKtm looks like it finally models ball-lightning with solid	    MHD physics. -- Jim Bowery]    ION DRIVES:	Retrieve files pub/SPACE/SPACELINK/6.5.2.* from the Ames SPACE	archive; these deal with many aspects of ion drives and describe the	SERT I and II missions, which flight-tested cesium ion thrusters in	the 1960s and 70s.

Except when someone else has cooked a meal for me,I only eat fruit, vegetables, and whole grain or bran cereals.  Iestimate I only get about 5 to 10 percent of my calories from fat.Very little sugar or salt.Very high fiber.  Most Americans get about 10 grams.  25 to 35 arerecommended.  I get between 50 and 150.  Sometimes 200.  (I've heardof people taking fiber pills.  It seems unlikely that pills cancontain enough fiber to make a difference.  It would be about aslikely as someone getting fat by popping fat pills.  Tablets arejust too small, unless you snarf down hundreds of them daily.)My ""clean your plate"" conditioning works *for* me.  Eating the last10% takes half my eating time, and gives satiety a chance to catchup, so I don't still feel hungry and go start eating something else.I don't eat when I'm not hungry (unless I'm sure I'll get hungryshortly, and eating won't be practical then).I bike to work, 22 miles a day, year round.  Fast.  I also bike tostores, movies, and everywhere else, as I've never owned a car.I estimate this burns about 1000 calories a day.  It also helpsbuild and maintain muscle mass, prevent insulin resistance (diabetesruns in my family), and increase my metabolism.  (Even so, mymetabolism is so low that when I'm at rest I'm most comfortablewith a temperature in the 90s (F), and usually wear a sweater ifit drops to 80.)  Cycling also motivates me to avoid every excessounce.  (Cyclists routinely pay a premium for cycling products thatweigh slightly less than others.  But it's easier and cheaper to trimweight from the rider than from the vehicle.)There's no question in my mind that my metabolism is radicallydifferent from that of most people who have never been fat.

If the wages of sin is the above paragraph, then>JESUS DIDN'T PAY FOR OUR SINS, DID HE?This is something I've always found a little curious. I've never quite understoodthe trinity thing. On the one hand, Jesus is supposed to be God incarnate. But,at the same time, he is God's son ""For God so loved the world that he gave hisonly begotten son"". First question is, if Jesus was God in human form, how couldhe really be God's son? If the Holy Ghost ""planted the seed"" in Mary, so to speak,then it seems that Jesus' relationship to God would be the equivalent to thehuman father/son relationship. While a son might inherit alot of the father's qualities, he is not the father. They are still two separite entities. To tryand say that a son is the same person as the father is obviously wrong. In thatcase, Jesus and God aren't the same. On the other hand, if their relationshipisn't the same as the human father/son relationship, but Jesus is actually Godincarnate, then he's not really God's son and he never was. He's just Godmanifesting himself as Jesus. At least, this is how I'm seeing it. Can someonewho is more knowledgeable about the trinity enlighten us? Getting back to the original question, what is the great price that Jesus paidto redeem our sins? Was it dying on the cross? Since Jesus knew that he wouldrise again in 3 days and then ascend back to heaven, I have a hard time seeinghow this is considered paying such a great price for humanity. His earthly bodymay have been killed, but then, so what? He suffered a few hours of physicalpain, but then, there has been many a human who has suffered a great deal more.The fact that Jesus was God's only begotten son doesn't seem to me to have muchmeaning since God can beget as many sons as he wants to. Jesus being the onlyone was simply a matter of choice. I suspect that these questions will be veryoffensive to many Christians on this net. To those people, please accept mysincere apologies. It is not my intention to offend or to trivialize Christ.But, I do believe these are legitimate questions and I am genuinely curious. [Note that the Trinity and Incarnation have to be looked at together.First, your reading of the Virgin Birth is an uncommon one.  (In thisgroup, it's dangerous to say that no one believes something.)  Youseem to be suggesting the Jesus is God's son in a physical sense,with the Holy Spirit as Father and Mary as Mother.  I consider thatterrible heresy, though some people react less violently.  The VirginBirth says that Jesus' birth is God's responsibility.  But it doesn'timply that God's sperm was involved.  Indeed one (though by no meansthe only) speculation is that God used Joseph's genetic material.Second, Jesus is in some sense doubly indirect from the Father.  In aTrinitarian context, the term Son refers to the eternal Logos, who isa part of God.  The Son didn't come into existence with Jesus' birth.Jesus is the incarnation of the Son.  So his sonness isn'tspecifically a result of being incarnated.  Rather, it's the Sonwho was incarnated.--clh]"	soc.religion.christian

If there is little understanding of the medical procedure we know as abortion, it isnot surprising the Bible makes little reference to it, as it makes littlereference to nuclear power and contamination.While your interpretation is a reasonable one, I see no reason to rejectthe other out of hand.

But they have been systematically           IGNORING or SUPPRESSING an excellent one for 30 years!                The late Physicist Dewey B. Larson's comprehensive           GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the physical universe, which he           calls the ""Reciprocal System"", is built on two fundamental           postulates about the physical and mathematical natures of           space and time:                    (1) ""The physical universe is composed ENTIRELY of ONE           component, MOTION, existing in THREE dimensions, in DISCRETE           UNITS, and in two RECIPROCAL forms, SPACE and TIME.""                    (2) ""The physical universe conforms to the relations of           ORDINARY COMMUTATIVE mathematics, its magnitudes are           ABSOLUTE, and its geometry is EUCLIDEAN.""                    From these two postulates, Larson developed a COMPLETE           Theoretical Universe, using various combinations of           translational, vibrational, rotational, and vibrational-          rotational MOTIONS, the concepts of IN-ward and OUT-ward           SCALAR MOTIONS, and speeds in relation to the Speed of Light           (which Larson called ""UNIT VELOCITY"" and ""THE NATURAL           DATUM"").                      At each step in the development, Larson was able to           MATCH objects in his Theoretical Universe with objects in the           REAL physical universe, (photons, sub-atomic particles           [INCOMPLETE ATOMS], charges, atoms, molecules, globular star           clusters, galaxies, binary star systems, solar systems, white           dwarf stars, pulsars, quasars, ETC.), even objects NOT YET           DISCOVERED THEN (such as EXPLODING GALAXIES, and GAMMA-RAY           BURSTS).                          And applying his Theory to his NEW model of the atom,           Larson was able to precisely and accurately CALCULATE inter-          atomic distances in crystals and molecules, compressibility           and thermal expansion of solids, and other properties of           matter.                All of this is described in good detail, with-OUT fancy           complex mathematics, in his books.               BOOKS of Dewey B.

Box 13255, Portland, OR  97213, and           should be available via inter-library loan if your local           university or public library doesn't have each of them.                Several of them, INCLUDING the last one, are available           from: The International Society of Unified Science (ISUS),           1680 E. Atkin Ave., Salt Lake City, Utah  84106.  This is the           organization that was started to promote Larson's Theory.            They have other related publications, including the quarterly           journal ""RECIPROCITY"".                     Physicist Dewey B. Larson's Background                   Physicist Dewey B. Larson was a retired Engineer           (Chemical or Electrical).  He was about 91 years old when he           died in May 1989.  He had a Bachelor of Science Degree in           Engineering Science from Oregon State University.  He           developed his comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the           physical universe while trying to develop a way to COMPUTE           chemical properties based only on the elements used.                    Larson's lack of a fancy ""PH.D."" degree might be one           reason that orthodox physicists are ignoring him, but it is           NOT A VALID REASON.  Sometimes it takes a relative outsider           to CLEARLY SEE THE FOREST THROUGH THE TREES.  At the same           time, it is clear from his books that he also knew ORTHODOX           physics and astronomy as well as ANY physicist or astronomer,           well enough to point out all their CONTRADICTIONS, AD HOC           ASSUMPTIONS, PRINCIPLES OF IMPOTENCE, IN-CONSISTENCIES, ETC..                     Larson did NOT have the funds, etc. to experimentally           test his Theory.  And it was NOT necessary for him to do so.            He simply compared the various parts of his Theory with OTHER           researchers' experimental and observational data.  And in           many cases, HIS explanation FIT BETTER.                    A SELF-CONSISTENT Theory is MUCH MORE than the ORTHODOX           physicists and astronomers have!  They CLAIM to be looking           for a ""unified field theory"" that works, but have been           IGNORING one for over 30 years now!                    ""Modern physics"" does NOT explain the physical universe           so well.  Some parts of some of Larson's books are FULL of           quotations of leading orthodox physicists and astronomers who           agree.  And remember that ""epicycles"", ""crystal spheres"",           ""geocentricity"", ""flat earth theory"", etc., ALSO once SEEMED           to explain it well, but were later proved CONCEPTUALLY WRONG.                        Prof. Frank H. Meyer, Professor Emeritus of UW-Superior,           was/is a STRONG PROPONENT of Larson's Theory, and was (or           still is) President of Larson's organization, ""THE           INTERNATIONAL SOCIETY OF UNIFIED SCIENCE"", and Editor of           their quarterly Journal ""RECIPROCITY"".  He moved to           Minneapolis after retiring.               ""Super Collider"" BOONDOGGLE!                         I am AGAINST contruction of the ""Superconducting Super           Collider"", in Texas or anywhere else.  It would be a GROSS           WASTE of money, and contribute almost NOTHING of ""scientific""           value.                    Most physicists don't realize it, but, according to the           comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the late Physicist           Dewey B. Larson, as described in his books, the strange GOOFY           particles (""mesons"", ""hyperons"", ALLEGED ""quarks"", etc.)           which they are finding in EXISTING colliders (Fermi Lab,           Cern, etc.) are really just ATOMS of ANTI-MATTER, which are           CREATED by the high-energy colliding beams, and which quickly           disintegrate like cosmic rays because they are incompatible           with their environment.                    A larger and more expensive collider will ONLY create a           few more elements of anti-matter that the physicists have not           seen there before, and the physicists will be EVEN MORE           CONFUSED THAN THEY ARE NOW!                    Are a few more types of anti-matter atoms worth the $8.3           BILLION cost?!!  Don't we have much more important uses for           this WASTED money?!                         Another thing to consider is that the primary proposed           location in Texas has a serious and growing problem with some           kind of ""fire ants"" eating the insulation off underground           cables.  How much POISONING of the ground and ground water           with insecticides will be required to keep the ants out of           the ""Supercollider""?!                              Naming the ""Super Collider"" after Ronald Reagon, as           proposed, is TOTALLY ABSURD!  If it is built, it should be           named after a leading particle PHYSICIST.                 LARSONIAN Anti-Matter                         In Larson's comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the           physical universe, anti-matter is NOT a simple case of           opposite charges of the same types of particles.  It has more           to do with the rates of vibrations and rotations of the           photons of which they are made, in relation to the           vibrational and rotational equivalents of the speed of light,           which Larson calls ""Unit Velocity"" and the ""Natural Datum"".                     In Larson's Theory, a positron is actually a particle of           MATTER, NOT anti-matter.  When a positron and electron meet,           the rotational vibrations (charges) and rotations of their           respective photons (of which they are made) neutralize each           other.                      In Larson's Theory, the ANTI-MATTER half of the physical           universe has THREE dimensions of TIME, and ONLY ONE dimension           of space, and exists in a RECIPROCAL RELATIONSHIP to our           MATERIAL half.                  LARSONIAN Relativity                         The perihelion point in the orbit of the planet Mercury           has been observed and precisely measured to ADVANCE at the           rate of 574 seconds of arc per century.  531 seconds of this           advance are attributed via calculations to gravitational           perturbations from the other planets (Venus, Earth, Jupiter,           etc.).  The remaining 43 seconds of arc are being used to           help ""prove"" Einstein's ""General Theory of Relativity"".                    But the late Physicist Dewey B. Larson achieved results           CLOSER to the 43 seconds than ""General Relativity"" can, by           INSTEAD using ""SPECIAL Relativity"".  In one or more of his           books, he applied the LORENTZ TRANSFORMATION on the HIGH           ORBITAL SPEED of Mercury.                    Larson TOTALLY REJECTED ""General Relativity"" as another           MATHEMATICAL FANTASY.  He also REJECTED most of ""Special           Relativity"", including the parts about ""mass increases"" near           the speed of light, and the use of the Lorentz Transform on           doppler shifts, (Those quasars with red-shifts greater than           1.000 REALLY ARE MOVING FASTER THAN THE SPEED OF LIGHT,           although most of that motion is away from us IN TIME.).                     In Larson's comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the           physical universe, there are THREE dimensions of time instead           of only one.  But two of those dimensions can NOT be measured           from our material half of the physical universe.  The one           dimension that we CAN measure is the CLOCK time.  At low           relative speeds, the values of the other two dimensions are           NEGLIGIBLE; but at high speeds, they become significant, and           the Lorentz Transformation must be used as a FUDGE FACTOR.           [Larson often used the term ""COORDINATE TIME"" when writing           about this.]                         In regard to ""mass increases"", it has been PROVEN in           atomic accelerators that acceleration drops toward zero near           the speed of light.  But the formula for acceleration is           ACCELERATION = FORCE / MASS, (a = F/m).  Orthodox physicists           are IGNORING the THIRD FACTOR: FORCE.  In Larson's Theory,           mass STAYS CONSTANT and FORCE drops toward zero.  FORCE is           actually a MOTION, or COMBINATIONS of MOTIONS, or RELATIONS           BETWEEN MOTIONS, including INward and OUTward SCALAR MOTIONS.            The expansion of the universe, for example, is an OUTward           SCALAR motion inherent in the universe and NOT a result of           the so-called ""Big Bang"" (which is yet another MATHEMATICAL           FANTASY).                                                             THE UNIVERSE OF MOTION               I wish to recommend to EVERYONE the book ""THE UNIVERSE           OF MOTION"", by Dewey B. Larson, 1984, North Pacific           Publishers, (P.O. Box 13255, Portland, Oregon  97213), 456           pages, indexed, hardcover.                    It contains the Astrophysical portions of a GENERAL           UNIFIED Theory of the physical universe developed by that           author, an UNrecognized GENIUS, more than thirty years ago.                    It contains FINAL SOLUTIONS to most ALL Astrophysical           mysteries, including the FORMATION of galaxies, binary and           multiple star systems, and solar systems, the TRUE ORIGIN of           the ""3-degree"" background radiation, cosmic rays, and gamma-          ray bursts, and the TRUE NATURE of quasars, pulsars, white           dwarfs, exploding galaxies, etc..                    It contains what astronomers and astrophysicists are ALL           looking for, if they are ready to seriously consider it with           OPEN MINDS!                    The following is an example of his Theory's success:           In his first book in 1959, ""THE STRUCTURE OF THE PHYSICAL           UNIVERSE"", Larson predicted the existence of EXPLODING           GALAXIES, several years BEFORE astronomers started finding           them.  They are a NECESSARY CONSEQUENCE of Larson's           comprehensive Theory.  And when QUASARS were discovered, he           had an immediate related explanation for them also.                GAMMA-RAY BURSTS               Astro-physicists and astronomers are still scratching           their heads about the mysterious GAMMA-RAY BURSTS.  They were           originally thought to originate from ""neutron stars"" in the           disc of our galaxy.  But the new Gamma Ray Telescope now in           Earth orbit has been detecting them in all directions           uniformly, and their source locations in space do NOT           correspond to any known objects, (except for a few cases of           directional coincidence).                    Gamma-ray bursts are a NECESSARY CONSEQUENCE of the           GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the physical universe developed by           the late Physicist Dewey B. Larson.  According to page 386 of           his book ""THE UNIVERSE OF MOTION"", published in 1984, the           gamma-ray bursts are coming from SUPERNOVA EXPLOSIONS in the           ANTI-MATTER HALF of the physical universe, which Larson calls           the ""Cosmic Sector"".  Because of the relationship between the           anti-matter and material halves of the physical universe, and           the way they are connected together, the gamma-ray bursts can           pop into our material half anywhere in space, seemingly at           random.  (This is WHY the source locations of the bursts do           not correspond with known objects, and come from all           directions uniformly.)                    I wonder how close to us in space a source location           would have to be for a gamma-ray burst to kill all or most           life on Earth!  There would be NO WAY to predict one, NOR to           stop it!                    Perhaps some of the MASS EXTINCTIONS of the past, which           are now being blamed on impacts of comets and asteroids, were           actually caused by nearby GAMMA-RAY BURSTS!               LARSONIAN Binary Star Formation                         About half of all the stars in the galaxy in the           vicinity of the sun are binary or double.  But orthodox           astronomers and astrophysicists still have no satisfactory           theory about how they form or why there are so many of them.                    But binary star systems are actually a LIKELY           CONSEQUENCE of the comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of           the physical universe developed by the late Physicist Dewey           B. Larson.                    I will try to summarize Larsons explanation, which is           detailed in Chapter 7 of his book ""THE UNIVERSE OF MOTION""           and in some of his other books.                    First of all, according to Larson, stars do NOT generate           energy by ""fusion"".  A small fraction comes from slow           gravitational collapse.  The rest results from the COMPLETE           ANNIHILATION of HEAVY elements (heavier than IRON).  Each           element has a DESTRUCTIVE TEMPERATURE LIMIT.  The heavier the           element is, the lower is this limit.  A star's internal           temperature increases as it grows in mass via accretion and           absorption of the decay products of cosmic rays, gradually           reaching the destructive temperature limit of lighter and           lighter elements.                    When the internal temperature of the star reaches the           destructive temperature limit of IRON, there is a Type I           SUPERNOVA EXPLOSION!  This is because there is SO MUCH iron           present; and that is related to the structure of iron atoms           and the atom building process, which Larson explains in some           of his books [better than I can].                    When the star explodes, the lighter material on the           outer portion of the star is blown outward in space at less           than the speed of light.  The heavier material in the center           portion of the star was already bouncing around at close to           the speed of light, because of the high temperature.  The           explosion pushes that material OVER the speed of light, and           it expands OUTWARD IN TIME, which is equivalent to INWARD IN           SPACE, and it often actually DISAPPEARS for a while.                    Over long periods of time, both masses start to fall           back gravitationally.  The material that had been blown           outward in space now starts to form a RED GIANT star.  The           material that had been blown OUTWARD IN TIME starts to form a           WHITE DWARF star.  BOTH stars then start moving back toward           the ""MAIN SEQUENCE"" from opposite directions on the H-R           Diagram.                    The chances of the two masses falling back into the           exact same location in space, making a single lone star           again, are near zero.  They will instead form a BINARY           system, orbiting each other.                     According to Larson, a white dwarf star has an INVERSE           DENSITY GRADIENT (is densest at its SURFACE), because the           material at its center is most widely dispersed (blown           outward) in time.   This ELIMINATES the need to resort to           MATHEMATICAL FANTASIES about ""degenerate matter"", ""neutron           stars"", ""black holes"", etc..               LARSONIAN Solar System Formation               If the mass of the heavy material at the center of the           exploding star is relatively SMALL, then, instead of a single           white dwarf star, there will be SEVERAL ""mini"" white dwarf           stars (revolving around the red giant star, but probably           still too far away in three-dimensional TIME to be affected           by its heat, etc.).  These will become PLANETS!                      In Chapter 7 of THE UNIVERSE OF MOTION, Larson used all           this information, and other principles of his comprehensive           GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the physical universe, to derive           his own version of Bode's Law.                     ""Black Hole"" FANTASY!               I heard that physicist Stephen W. Hawking recently           completed a theoretical mathematical analysis of TWO ""black           holes"" merging together into a SINGLE ""black hole"", and           concluded that the new ""black hole"" would have MORE MASS than           the sum of the two original ""black holes"".                    Such a result should be recognized by EVERYone as a RED           FLAG, causing widespread DOUBT about the whole IDEA of ""black           holes"", etc.!                    After reading Physicist Dewey B. Larson's books about           his comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the physical           universe, especially his book ""THE UNIVERSE OF MOTION"", it is           clear to me that ""black holes"" are NOTHING more than           MATHEMATICAL FANTASIES!  The strange object at Cygnus X-1 is           just an unusually massive WHITE DWARF STAR, NOT the ""black           hole"" that orthodox astronomers and physicists so badly want           to ""prove"" their theory.                        By the way, I do NOT understand why so much publicity is           being given to physicist Stephen Hawking.  The physicists and           astronomers seem to be acting as if Hawking's severe physical           problem somehow makes him ""wiser"".  It does NOT!                    I wish the same attention had been given to Physicist           Dewey B. Larson while he was still alive.  Widespread           publicity and attention should NOW be given to Larson's           Theory, books, and organization (The International Society of           Unified Science).                                         ELECTRO-MAGNETIC PROPULSION               I heard of that concept many years ago, in connection           with UFO's and unorthodox inventors, but I never was able to           find out how or why they work, or how they are constructed.                    I found a possible clue about why they might work on           pages 112-113 of the book ""BASIC PROPERTIES OF MATTER"", by           the late Physicist Dewey B. Larson, which describes part of           Larson's comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the physical           universe.  I quote one paragraph:                    ""As indicated in the preceding chapter, the development           of the theory of the universe of motion arrives at a totally           different concept of the nature of electrical resistance.            The electrons, we find, are derived from the environment.  It           was brought out in Volume I [Larson's book ""NOTHING BUT           MOTION""] that there are physical processes in operation which           produce electrons in substantial quantities, and that,           although the motions that constitute these electrons are, in           many cases, absorbed by atomic structures, the opportunities           for utilizing this type of motion in such structures are           limited.  It follows that there is always a large excess of           free electrons in the material sector [material half] of the           universe, most of which are uncharged.  In this uncharged           state the electrons cannot move with respect to extension           space, because they are inherently rotating units of space,           and the relation of space to space is not motion.  In open           space, therefore, each uncharged electron remains permanently           in the same location with respect to the natural reference           system, in the manner of a photon.  In the context of the           stationary spatial reference system the uncharged electron,           like the photon, is carried outward at the speed of light by           the progression of the natural reference system.  All           material aggregates are thus exposed to a flux of electrons           similar to the continual bombardment by photons of radiation.            Meanwhile there are other processes, to be discussed later,           whereby electrons are returned to the environment.  The           electron population of a material aggregate such as the earth           therefore stabilizes at an equilibrium level.""                          Note that in Larson's Theory, UNcharged electrons are           also massLESS, and are basically photons of light of a           particular frequency (above the ""unit"" frequency) spinning           around one axis at a particular rate (below the ""unit"" rate).            (""Unit velocity"" is the speed of light, and there are           vibrational and rotational equivalents to the speed of light,           according to Larson's Theory.)  [I might have the ""above"" and           ""below"" labels mixed up.]                    Larson is saying that outer space is filled with mass-          LESS UN-charged electrons flying around at the speed of           light!                    If this is true, then the ELECTRO-MAGNETIC PROPULSION           fields of spacecraft might be able to interact with these           electrons, or other particles in space, perhaps GIVING them a           charge (and mass) and shooting them toward the rear to           achieve propulsion. (In Larson's Theory, an electrical charge           is a one-dimensional rotational vibration of a particular           frequency (above the ""unit"" frequency) superimposed on the           rotation of the particle.)                      The paragraph quoted above might also give a clue to           confused meteorologists about how and why lightning is           generated in clouds.           SUPPRESSION of LARSONIAN Physics               The comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the physical           universe developed by the late Physicist Dewey B. Larson has           been available for more than 30 YEARS, published in 1959 in           his first book ""THE STRUCTURE OF THE PHYSICAL UNIVERSE"".                    It is TOTALLY UN-SCIENTIFIC for Hawking, Wheeler, Sagan,           and the other SACRED PRIESTS of the RELIGION they call           ""science"" (or ""physics"", or ""astronomy"", etc.), as well as           the ""scientific"" literature and the ""education"" systems, to           TOTALLY IGNORE Larson's Theory has they have.                    Larson's Theory has excellent explanations for many           things now puzzling orthodox physicists and astronomers, such           as gamma-ray bursts and the nature of quasars.                    Larson's Theory deserves to be HONESTLY and OPENLY           discussed in the physics, chemistry, and astronomy journals,           in the U.S. and elsewhere.  And at least the basic principles           of Larson's Theory should be included in all related courses           at UW-EC, UW-Madison, Cambridge, Cornell University, and           elsewhere, so that students are not kept in the dark about a           worthy alternative to the DOGMA they are being fed.

I mean, it was theFinnish team they played and they were taking advantage of the ridiculouspenalties the Canadien ref called in the last period. The Germans got amatch penalty and a 10 minutes misconduct for practically nothing andseconds after that the German goalie got two minutes for ""delay of game""for a shot that was deflected and went into the crowd. The resulting 5:3skating advantage lead to the deciding goal at a point, when the Germanswere starting to come up strong.I am also sick of the nationalism that is going on in German sports events.If you watch for example a tennis Davis Cup match the players are often notable to play for minutes, because the crowd is so obnoxious. But I have toadmit that this kind of nationalism is as strong or even stronger in mostother countries (you should go to the US and watch the way they present theOlympics on television; or the soccer crowds in England; or the Finnishspectators at nordic skiing events.....). I mean it makes me sick to seeall this nationalism all over the world and I would rather see the bestteam/player win and get cheared at. I do not mind if my favorite teamlooses to somebody that is better or plays more attractive and I have toadmit that in most sports the German national site is not my favorite teamto watch (the German soccer team is boring to watch, for example).But, reading the above posting, I think that you are on the same level asthese crowds you are criticizing. It is easy to talk of (nearly all)Germans as Nazis and nationalists; thats the kind of propaganda that allultraconservative people use against Germany. It is true that there is agreat danger of re-arising nationalism in Germany but from my experiencemost of the people (at least of the people that i know) also regard this asa big threat and are trying to demonstrate this attitude now. Why can't wejust look at people as human beeings and not try to put them into drawerscorresponding to their nationality (eg. all Russians are Communists; allAmericans are Capitalists; all Germans are Nazis, all Fins are hangingaround beeing drunk on ferries...). In my opinion, your comment shows the narrowness of your mind and that youdon't seem to be different from the Nazis you are talking about.Thomas""There's no time to hate, barely time to wait"" (Jerry Garcia/Robert Hunter)"	rec.sport.hockey

I was alsoshocked when I first realized that you have to offset lines from fills byabout 16 bits (assuming 24 bit z buffer).  This seems huge, but is only1/256 of the dynamic range.  In those terms it doesn't seem so bad.  Whatis happening is that the interpolation in z is not totally linear, duemainly to roundoff, I believe.  So the polygon is not planar in z, but ismore like a Ruffles potato chip.  Ditto with lines.  When you start/end atdifferent x/y values, the ""ridges"" are out of phase, resulting in thestitch effect.  You have the same problem if you try to draw 1 polygonright on top of another, but with different vertices.  You will likely seea smeared effect where they overlap.  Example:  Try Polygon 1: (100,100,100) (100,200,100) (200,200,100) (200,100,100)      Polygon 2: (125,125,100) (125,175,100) (175,175,100) (175,125,100)Your implementation is correct.  In fact, we do a similar trick whenrendering primitives that have lines and polygons - such as NURBS surfaceswith isoparametric lines.  Without the trick, the lines appear stitched, asyou say.  When the application draws lines/polygons independently, thesystem does not have the smarts to automatically do the z shifting, so theapplication must do it.

New Method For Diagnosing Alzheimer's Disease Discovered atHuntington Medical Research Institutes: Results to Be Reported To: National Desk, Health Writer Contact: John Lockhart or Belinda Gerber, 310-444-7000, or          800-522-8877, for the Huntington Medical Research          Institutes.   LOS ANGELES, April 28  -- A new method for diagnosing and measuring chemical imbalances in the brainwhich lead to Alzheimer's disease and other dementias has beendiscovered by researchers at the Huntington Medical ResearchInstitutes (HMRI) in Pasadena, Calif.  Results of their researchwill be reported in the May issue of the scientific journal,Radiology.   Using an advanced form of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)called magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS), a research team ledby Brian D. Ross, M.D., D. Phil., conducted a study on 21 elderlypatients who were believed to be suffering from some form ofdementia. The exams used standard MRI equipment fitted with specialsoftware developed at HMRI called Clinical Proton MRS.  ClinicalProton MRS is easily applied, giving doctors confirmatory diagnosesin less than 30 minutes.  An automated version of Clinical ProtonMRS called Proton Brain Examination (PROBE) reduces the examinationtime yet further, providing confirmatory diagnoses in less than 10minutes.  By comparison, the current ""standard of care"" in testingfor Alzheimer's disease calls for lengthy memory function andneuropsychological tests, which can be very upsetting to thepatient, are not definitive and can only be confirmed by autopsy.   In addition to Alzheimer's disease, the new Clinical Proton MRSexam may have applications in diagnosing other dementias, includingAIDS-related dementia, Parkinson's disease and Huntington'sdisease.   ""We've developed a simple test which can be administered quicklyand relatively inexpensively using existing MRI equipment fittedwith either the MRS or PROBE software,"" said Dr. Ross, adding,""this will help physicians to diagnose Alzheimer's earlier andintervene with therapeutics before the progression of the diseasecauses further damage to the delicate inner workings of the brain.""   Dr. Ross and his HMRI team measured a family of chemicals in thebrain known as inositols, and myo-inositol (MI) acted as a markerin the study.  In comparison to healthy patients, those diagnosedwith Alzheimer's showed a 22 percent increase in MI, while theirlevel of another chemical called N-acetylaspartate (NAA) wassignificantly lower, indicating a loss of brain-stimulating neuronsbelieved to be associated with the progression of the disease.   Current drug therapy for Alzheimer's disease is widelyconsidered to be inadequate.  This is attributable, Dr. Rossbelieves, to the theory that Alzheimer's is caused by aninterruption in the transmission of the chemical acetylcholine tothe nerve cells. This belief has been adhered to over the last 15years, and consequently, most drugs to treat Alzheimer's were basedon the changing receptors for acetylcholine.   ""Physicians have a real need for a test to differentiateAlzheimer's from other dementias, to provide the patient and his orher family with a firm diagnosis and to monitor future treatmentprotocols for the treatment of this disease.  For this reason, weconsider this test a major advancement in medicine,"" said BruceMiller, M.D., a noted neurologist at Harbor-UCLA, MRS researcherand a co-author of the study.   Other members of the HMRI research team included Rex A. Moats,Ph.D., Truda Shonk, B.S., Thomas Ernst, Ph.D., and Suzanne Woolley,R.N.  The PROBE software can be fitted on the approximately 1,200General Electric MRI units currently in use in the United States,and will be configured for other manufacturers' MRI units soon.   For interviews with Dr. Ross, advance copies of the RadiologyMay issue, and other information, please contact John Lockhart orBelinda Gerber for HMRI at 310-444-7000 or 800-522-8877.   Q & A on Alzheimer's Disease:   What is Alzheimer's disease and how is it caused?   Alzheimer's disease (AD) is an incurable degenerative disease ofthe brain first described in 1906 by the German neuropathologistAlois Alzheimer.  As the disease progresses, it leads to loss ofmemory and mental functioning, followed by changes in personality,loss of control of bodily functions, and, eventually, death.   How many people does it affect?   Alzheimer's disease affects an estimated 4 million adults inthe United States and is the fourth leading cause of death, takingapproximately 100,000 lives each year.  While Alzheimer'sdebilitates its victims, it is equally devastating, bothemotionally and financially, for patients' families.  AD is themost common cause of dementia in adults.  Symptoms worsen everyyear, and death usually occurs within 10 years of initial onset.   What are its signs and symptoms?   Although the cause of AD is not known, two risk factors havebeen identified: advanced age and genetic predisposition.  The riskof developing AD is less than one percent before the age of 50yars old, but increases steeply in each successive decade of lifeto reach 30 percent by the age of 90.  In patients with familialAD, immediate family relatives have a 50 percent chance ofdeveloping AD.  One of its first symptoms is severe ""forgetfulness""caused by short-term memory loss.  Dr. Herman Weinreb of the Schoolof Medicine at New York University says ""whether forgetfulness isa serious symptom or not is largely a matter of degree"" andsuggests the following criteria:   -- Forgetting the name of someone you see infrequently is      normal.   -- Forgetting the name of a loved one is serious.   -- Forgetting where you left your keys is normal.   -- Forgetting how to get home is serious.   Doctors suggest that people with severe symptoms should beevaluated in order to rule out Alzheimer's disease and other formsof dementia. -30---Canada Remote Systems - Toronto, Ontario416-629-7000/629-7044"	sci.med

Why does the ADL have an interest in that person ?You should ask the ADL, if you want an authoritative answer.

I further believe that they did this asagents of the Israeli government, or at least in agreement with them.At least some of the information collected by the ADL was passed on toIsraeli officials.  In some cases it was used to influence, or attemptto influence, people's access to jobs or public forums.  These matterswill be brought out as the court case unfolds, since California lawentitles people to compensation if such actions can be proven.

If we are going to get anywhere in this (or any) discussion, it doesn't help to bring up elements I never addressed, *nor commented on in any way*.

[The *purpose* of an army's use of military uniforms 	is *to set its members apart* from the civilians so that 	civilians will not be thought of by the other side as	""combatants"". So, what do you think is the ""meaning behind"", 	the intention and the effect when an ""army"" purposely 	*does not were uniforms but goes out of its way to *look 	like civilians'? *They are judging that the benefit they will 	receive from this ""cover"" is more important that the harm	that will come to civilians.*This is a comment on the Israeli experience and is sayingthat the guerillas *do* have some responsibility in putting civiliansin ""the middle"" of this fight. By putting on uniforms and living apartfrom civilians (barracks, etc.), the guerillas would significantly lowerthe risk to civilians.	But if the guerillas do this aren't *they* putting themselves	at greater risk? Absolutely, they ask themselves ""why set 	ourselves apart (by wearing uniforms) when there is a ready-made 	cover for us (civilians)?

I have always thought that Israel's bombingsortees and bombing policy is stupid, thoughtless, inhumane ANDineffective. BUT, there is no reason that Israel should passive wait until attackers chose to act; there is every reason to believe that""taking the fight *to* the enemy"" will do more to stop attacks. As I said previously, Israel spent several decades ""sitting passively""on its side of a border and only acting to stop these attacks *after*the attackers had entered Israeli territory. It didn't work very well.The ""host"" Arab state did little/nothing to try and stop these attacks from its side of the border with Israel so the number of attackswere considerably higher, as was their physical and psychological impact on the civilians caught in their path.  >>|> What?So the whole bit about attacks on Israel from neighboring Arab states >|> can start all over again?

This is just another ""selectively applied"" statement. The reason for this drawn-out impasse between Ababs/Palestinians and Israelisis that NEITHER side is willing to accept the Word of the other. By yourcriteria *everyone* should stay away from the negotiations.That is precisely why the Palestinians (in their recent PISGA proposal for the ""interim"" period after negotiations and leading up to full autonomy) aredemanding conditions that essentially define ""autonomy"" already. They DONOT trust that Israel will ""follow through"" the entire process and allowPalestinians to reach full autonomy. Do you understand and accept this viewpoint by the Palestinians? If you do, then why should Israel's view of Arabs/Palestinians be any different? Why should they trust the Arab/Palestinians' words?Since they don't, they are VERY reluctant to give up ""tangible assets (land, control of areas) in exchange for ""words"". For this reason,they are also concerned about the sorts of ""guarantees"" they will have that the Arabs WILL follow through on their part of any agreement reached.>>But don't you see that the same statement can be made both ways?>If Lebanon was interested in peace then it should accept the word>of Israel that the attacks were the cause for war and disarming the>Hizbollah will remove the cause for its continued occupancy.  Absolutely, so are the Arabs/Palestinians asking FIRST for theIsraelis ""word"" in relation to any agreement? NO, what is beingdemanded FIRST is LAND. When the issue is LAND, and one partyfinally gets HOLD of this ""land"", what the ""other party"" doesis totally irrelevent. If I NOW have possession of this land,your words have absolutely no power; whether Israel chooses tokeeps its word does NOT get the land back.>Afterall, Israel has already staged two parts of the withdrawal from >areas it occupied in Lebanon during SLG.>> Tim, you are ignoring the fact that the Palestinians in Lebanon have been> disarmed. Hezbollah remains the only independent militia. Hezbollah does> not attack Israel except at a few times such as when the IDF burned up> Sheikh Mosavi, his wife, and young son. While the ""major armaments"" (those allowing people to wage ""civil wars"")have been removed, the weapons needed to cross-border attacks stillremain to some extent. Rocket attacks still continue, and ""commando""raids only require a few easily concealed weapons and a refined disregardfor human life (yours of that of others). Such attacks also continue.> Of course, if Israel would withdraw from Lebanon> and stop assassinating people and shelling villages they wouldn't> make the Lebanese so mad as to do that.Bat guano. The situation you call for existed in the 1970s and attackswere commonplace.>Furthermore, with Hezbollah subsequently disarmed, it would not be possible.There is NO WAY these groups can be effectively ""disarmed"" UNLESS the stateis as authoritarian is Syria's. The only other way is for Lebanon to takeit upon itself to constantly patrol the entire border with Israel, essentiallymirroring Israel's border secirity on its side. It HAS TO PROVE TO ISREAL thatit is this committed to protecting Israel from attack from Lebanese territory.>>|> Once Syria leaves who is to say that Lebanon will be able to retain >|> control?

But, doesn't that mean that Syria has to ""take over""Lebanon? I don't think Israel or Lebanon would like that.> What both ""sides"" need is to receive something ""tangible"". The Arabs/Palestinians are looking for ""land"" and demanding that they receive itprior to giving anything to Israel. Israel has two problems: 1) if itgives up real *land* it IS exposing itself to a changed geostrategicsituation (and that change doesn't help Israel's position), and 2) WHENit gives up this land IT NEEDS to receive something in return tocompensate for the increased risksTim"	talk.politics.mideast

She has been to a doctor and taken the ordinary (?)tests and her values were regarded as low. The doctor (and my wife) arenot very interested in starting medication as this ""deactivates"" the gland, giving life-long dependency to the drug (hormone?). The last couple of monthes she has been seeing a hoemoepath (sp?) and been givensome drops to re-activate either her thyroidal gland and/or the 'message-center' in the brain (sorry about the approximate language,but I haven't got many clues to what the english terms are, but the brain-area is called the 'hypofyse' in norwegian.) My questions are: has anyone had/heard of success in using this approach?Her values have been (slowly but) steadily sinking, any comment on theprobability of improvement? Although the doctor has told her to 'eatnormally', my wife has dieted vigorously to keep her weight as she feelsthat is part of keeping an edge over the illness/condition, may thisaffect the treatment, development?I can get the exact figures for her tests for anyone interested, and Iwill greatly value any information/opinion/experience on this topic.I don't intend this post to be either a flaming of the establishedmedical profession or a praise for alternatives, I am just relayingevents as they have happened.Sincerely,Erik A.

Robert Weiss writes [a promise from Psalm 9:10]>Gee, since you wouldn't be at all hypocritical, you must be really>busy arguing against these out-of-context extracted translations!He directed a similar accusation of hypocrisy, again based on a lack ofresponse to an article by Robert Weiss, toward Stephen.I pointed out that I did, in fact, agree that both Robert Weiss andJim Meritt took quotes out of context.  Hence, I find it difficult tounderstand why Jim thinks I am a hypocrite.  Needless to say, I don'thave time to reply to *every* article on t.r.m. that takes a quoteout of context.  I asked Jim the following:>}So, according to you, Jim, the only way to criticize one person for>}taking a quote out of context, without being a hypocrite, is to post a>}response to *every* person on t.r.m who takes a quote out of context?Jim replied by saying >Did I either ask or assert that?But today we find four articles from Jim, one of which has the subject""Silence is concurrence"":  m23364@mwunix.mitre.org (James Meritt) writes:>Is it not the case that, in the eyes of the law, when someone is aware of>something and has the capability of taking action and does not, that individual>may be held responsible for that action?Which is, of course, a complete red herring.  Taking quotes out ofcontext isn't a crime.  I don't have time to read every article ont.r.m., and I'm certainly under no obligation to reply to them all.Does ""silence is concurrence"" imply that Jim thinks that because Ididn't respond to Weiss' articles I must condone Weiss' taking quotesout of context?  Jim doesn't want to give a direct answer to thisquestion; read what he has written and decide for yourself.But back to the context of my conversation with Jim.  Jim's next gambit was to claim that he was using inductive logic when heconcluded that I was being a hypocrite.  I challenged him to providethe details of that logic that led him to an incorrect conclusion.Today we find another obscure article (posting it twice didn't helpmake it more clear, Jim), titled ""Inductive Logic"":>Scenario:>A white goose waddles past the door>A white goose waddles past the door>A white goose waddles past the door>...( repeat an uncountably large number of times)...>A black goose waddles past the door.

Could Jim mean that he has read an uncountably largenumber of my articles?  Could Jim mean that because I ""axed"" his articles,but not Weiss' articles, he wants to conclude inductively ...Well, I can't see where he is going with this.But I can help him with his induction.  I've written roughly 80articles since January.  The vast majority of them are discussions withFrank DeCenso and other inerrantists, where I take the position thatthey are making bad arguments.  Some are discussions with Jim Merittwhere I take the position that he is making bad arguments (a straw manargument earlier, and taking quotes out of context more recently.)Think hard about this Jim.

Like the isrealites order to wipe out other tribes including women and children down to cattle, and punished severely when they were less than complete about the job.  Likejews who are said to have cried out in Matthew, ""His blood be upon our headsand our childrens heads"" A verse quoted in every pogrom from the crusades tothe holocaust.  Have these been misunderstood?  I think not.  They have onlybeen understood too clearly.  It is essential that christians grasp firmlythe good the bible teaches, the meek carpenter from Nazareth is a potent symbol for how we should be, his teachings we must take to heart, but wecannot ignore the other material in the bible which is not to our liking andsay those who live by that have misread it.  To say that is only to chose apoint of interpretation and declare it normative.  Such can be done with thesame legitmacy by anyone.

"Newsgroup:soc.religion.christiandocument_id: 20597From: vek@allegra.att.com (Van Kelly)Subject: Re: Prayer in Jesus' NameAccording to what I have read on Biblical idioms, speaking ""in X'sname"" is a standard Aramaic/Hebrew legal idiom for what we todaywould call Power of Attorney.  A person from Jesus' culture authorizedto conduct business ""in John's name"" had full authority over John'sfinancial affairs, but was held under a solemn fiduciary obligation towork only for John's benefit and consonant with John's wishes.  It wasnot required for the steward to preface each business transaction with""in John's name""; it was sufficient to have valid power of attorneyand be operating in good faith. (Note the overlap here between legaland religious definitions of ""faith"".)With this cultural background, praying ""in Jesus' name"" does notmandate a particular verbal formula; rather it requires that thepetitioner be operating faithfully and consciously within an analogous""fiduciary"" relationship with Jesus and for the purposes of HisKingdom.  The message of ""praying in Jesus' name"" is thus closelyaligned with the parable of the talents and other passages about God'sdelegation of Kingdom business to his stewards, both resources andresponsibilities.  This idea of praying ""in Jesus' name"" is not onlypresent but prominent in the Lord's Prayer, although the verbalforumula is absent.The act of praying the words ""In Jesus' Name"" may be beneficial ifthey cause us to clarify the relationship of our requests to theadvancement of God's Kingdom.  For that reason, I'm not quite readyto say that the praying the formula is without meaning.Prayers to God for other purposes (desperation, anger, thanksgiving,etc.) don't seem to be in this category at all, whether uttered byChristian or non-Christian, whether B.C. or A.D. (that's B.C.E. orC.E. for you P.C. :-).  I don't see anything in Christ's words tocontradict the idea that God deals with all prayers according to Hisomniscience and grace.Van Kellyvek@research.att.comThe above opinions are my own, and not those of AT&T."	soc.religion.christian

Space ScienceDept.) on this subject, specifically on a small-scale Solar Sailproposed as a student space project. The guy giving the talk was keen togenerate interest in the project. I'll typein the handout he gave out atthe meeting. Here goes : 			The Microlight Solar Sail			-------------------------1. IntroductionThe solar sail is a well-established concept. Harnessing the pressure ofsunlight, a spacecraft would have unlimited range. In principle, such avehicle could explore the whole Solar System with zero fuel consumption.However it is more difficult to design a practical solar sail than mostpeople realize. The pressure of sunlight is only about one kilogram persquare kilometer. Deploying and controlling the large area of aluminizedfabric which would be necessary to transport a 'conventional' typespacecraft is a daunting task. This is why, despite the potential of hteidea, no such craft has actually been launched to date.2.DesignRecent advances in microelectronics make possible a different concept: atiny sail just a few metres in diameter which could be controlled purelybe electronics, with no mechanical parts. Several attitude controlmethods are feasible: for example the pressure sunlight exerts on apanel of solar cells varies according to whether power is being drawn.The key components of the craft will be a minute CCD camera developed atEdinburgh University which can act as both attitude sensor and datagathering device; solar cells providing ~1 watt power for control andcommunication; and a directional radio antenna etched onto the surfaceof the sail itself. Launched as a piggyback payload, the total cost ofthe mission can be limited to a few tens of thousands of dollars.3.MissionsThe craft would be capable of some ambitious missions. For example:a) It could rendezvous with a nearby asteroid from the Apollo or Amorgroups. Closeup pictures could be transmitted back to Earth at a low bitrate.b) It could be steered into a lunar polar orbit. Previously unobservedareas around the lunar poles could be viewed. By angling the sail toreflect sunlight downwards, polar craters whose bases never receivesunlight could be imaged. Bright reflections would confirm thatvolatiles such as water ice have become trapped in theselocations.[Immensely valuable information for setting up a manned lunarbase, BTW]c) It could be sent to rendezvous with a small asteroid or cometnucleus. Impacting at low speed, a thin wire probe attached to the craftcauses it to rebound while capturing a tiny sample is a sharp-edgedtube, like performing a biopsy. Returning to Earth, the sail acts as anideal re-entry parachute: load per unit area 20 gm/m2 ensures that heatis reradiated so efectively that the sail temperature cannot exceed ~300deg C. The material sample is recovered, enclosed in a small insulatingcontainer.Contact: Colin Jack                              Tel. 0865-200447Oxford Mathematical Designs, 131 High Street, Oxford OX1 4DH, England--------------------------------This guy would love to hear from anyone interested in this project orseeking details or anything, and would be most happy to send you moreinformation.

I am on aninformation gathering venture regarding the various expressions ofChristianity/churches there are.          My husband and I come from very different, but completelyChristian backgrounds.  I was a Lutheran when I met him and he was aborn and raised Church of Christ member.  At first I agreed with a lotof what the C of C was about, I wanted to move from the liturgicalbased Lutheran church to something a little more Biblical based.However over the last year, I've been regretting changing to theChurch of Christ for a number of reasons - for one thing I am not afundamentalist and believe that a few things in the Bible aresocio-cultural in nature and don't relate to the Christian doctrine.One of my sorest spots is the role of women.  I believe that throughMary and other women, Chris validated women as worthy disciples - butin the C of C the writings of Paul are taken without exception and Iam told that I am not an equal partner in my marriage but the lessermember, I am to submit to my husband in all things (if I hear thatverse one more time....) and I am not to take an active role inanything which might be construed as putting me in authority over men(ie leading prayers, conducting Bible studies etc).   The last strawwas when the Elders at our church came down on one of our collegegroups because it was all-women and they wanted a man to lead thestudy.Also my husband and I really resent the way everyone at our churchfeels that if you aren't a conservative republican - you aren't a REALChristian (I got told that nobody who voted for Clinton should callthemselves a Christian).  Hence we are subjected during the service tolong prayers calling for things we flatly dont agree with.  We arealso don't agree with the C of C's dread of any new ""movement"" beingled by the young people.So, we have been church hunting with NO success.  I want a reasonablybiblical based church where women are viewed as whole people no matterwhat their calling ( C of C really looked down on career women).Christopher is looking for a church with deeply rooted religiousconvictions, with adult baptism and a church where the members stillbring their Bibles to service.We are so confused here and we're drifting around trying to find aplace where we both feel loved and can express our faith honestly andwithout reservation.  If anyone can point us in a direction we'd bethrilled!I'm afraid that it will be very hard for me to go back to C of C andeven harder for me to stay churchless for long.any responses would be welcomethe diel family[I would think somewhere in the Baptist spectrum you might find whatyou're looking for.  However the issue is probably more one of theflavor of the specific local churches in your area than thedenomination -- Baptists cover quite a spectrum.  Adult baptism sortof narrows your choices on the more liberal end of the spectrum.Historically that's been associated with movements that have thecharacter you're trying to avoid.  --clh]"	soc.religion.christian

""The atrocities and massacres which have been committed for a long time against the Muslim population within the Armenian Republic have been  confirmed with very accurate information, and the observations made by Rawlinson, the British representative in Erzurum, have confirmed that these atrocities are being committed by the Armenians. The United States delegation of General Harbord has seen the thousands of refugees who came  to take refuge with Kazim Karabekir's soldiers, hungry and miserable,  their children and wives, their properties destroyed, and the delegation was a witness to the cruelties. Many Muslim villages have been destroyed by the soldiers of Armenian troops armed with cannons and machine guns before the eyes of Karabekir's troops and the people. When it was hoped that this operation would end, unfortunately since the beginning of  February the cruelties inflicted on the Muslim population of the region of Shuraghel, Akpazar, Zarshad, and Childir have increased. According to documented information, 28 Muslim villages have been destroyed in the aforementioned region, more than 2,000 people have been slaughtered, many possessions and livestock have been seized, young Muslim women have been taken to Kars and Gumru, thousands of women and children who were able to flee their villages were beaten, raped and massacred in the mountains, and this aggression against the properties, lives, chastity  and honour of the Muslims continued. It was the responsibility of the Armenian Government that the cruelties and massacres be stopped in order  to alleviate the tensions of Muslim public opinion due to the atrocities  committed by the Armenians, that the possessions taken from the Muslims be returned and that indemnities be paid, that the properties, lives, and honour of the Muslims be protected.""Serdar Argic                           'We closed the roads and mountain passes that                             might serve as ways of escape for the Turks                             and then proceeded in the work of extermination.'

From then on otherworkstatons can interact with it until some time later when it goes deaf again. The workstation is set up to share its discs etc. The machineis a 486DX/33, 8MB RAM, with Diamond Stealth video.

Newsgroup:sci.spacedocument_id: 61272From: David.Anderman@ofa123.fidonet.orgSubject: Update - Back to the Moon bill          Introducing the Back to the Moon in Congress:                          The Next Step                                  The next key hurdle for the Lunar Resources Data Purchase Act is introduction of the Act in Congress. At this point,  manycongresspersons have been approached about the bill. However,for a successful effort to pass the bill, we need the bestpossible congressperson to introduce the bill. Due to hisposition as Chair of the House Committee on Space and Science,Congressman George Brown is the logical choice. He has a longrecord of support and interest in space development, and helpedpass the Launch Services Purchase Act and the Space SettlementsAct.                              There is a small group of activists in southern California who have assisted George Brown in his recent re-election campaigns.We are mobilizing this group to have them tell Congressman Brownabout the Back to the Moon bill. We are also asking pro-spaceconstituents to let him know that they care about gettingAmerica back to the Moon.        Finally, there is a good chance that a nationwide alert for space activists to call or write George Brown to have himintroduce the Back to the Moon bill may be staged during latespring, 1993.        All this should produce a positive reaction from Brown'soffice. As more is known, it will be passed on.        However, even if we are successful in getting him to supportthe bill,  this alone will not ensure passage of the bill. Forany bill to become law, one of three conditions must exist:either the bill must reflect widespread national support for anissue (such as extension of unemployment insurance benefits); bepropelled by high-priced lobbyists (we're out of luck there); orhave widespread support within Congress, due to small, butwidespread, constituent support. The latter is the path that we,by necessity, must choose.                            This means that the introduction of the Lunar Resources Data Purchase Act must be immediately accompanied by a large numberof congresspersons' sponsorship of the bill.  To accomplishthis, we need activists to ask their congressperson to supportthe Lunar Resources Data Purchase Act - now. To wait until thebill is introduced is simply too late - it takes time to have acongressperson's staff review a bill.        If your congressperson mentions that the bill is not yetintroduced, please elicit their opinion of the bill as currentlywritten. We appreciate all comments on the bill from activistsand politicians.        If you have yet to see the Back to the Moon bill, pleaserequest a copy by Email (please include your U.S. postal serviceaddress), or contact your local chapter of the National SpaceSociety).--- Maximus 2.01wb	sci.space

If I move one part of the drawing, the lines that connect that part to the  rest of the drawing, stay connected.Ideally I want the tool so general and flexible that it is comfortable todraw electronic schematics, flow charts, logic diagrams, data flow diagramsand block diagrams with it.

Automatic setups are fine for simple,repetitive waveforms, but can give you some crazy results on morecomplex events where you need to understand how the scope isactually measuring/processing the event. For example, is the scopein ""equivalent time"" or in ""real time"" sampling mode (equivalent timebeing a mode where samples are built-up slowly by adding a delay tothe trigger event each sweep)? What was the scope's actual samplingrate at the time? How is the data being massaged after capture butbefore display, etc. One common misconception is the speed of the scope.Is the HP scope you're using really a 100 MHz scope? Or is it a 20 MHzsample rate scope (~5 MHz single shot significance) whose frontend including S/H can support 100 MHz waveforms (important forequivalent time sampling)? The 100 MHz input in this case reallyonly helps you when your waveform is repetitive, or on a singlesample, when you get lucky and hit a transient event during a sample time.So, there are a lot more variables in understanding how to getuseful information from a digital scope. I prefer an analog scope forgeneral use and the digital for events where I need storage forlater analysis or comparison, when the event is within the capabilityof the scope.

I respond.     The question that was raised was not if Jesus went to infernal Paradise     before entering into heaven. No one has made a point for or against      that issue, nor have they compared the LDS position against orthodox     belief. The infernal paradise is held to be Abraham's bosom (Luke 16),      the place of the righteous dead in sheol (equivalent to hades).     The point that was raised by John was that someone could not repent     on their death bed. Tom Albrecht pointed to a Biblical example that was     contradictory to what John's position put forward. The thief on the      cross was promised by Christ to be with Him in Paradise, the abode of      the righteous dead. John's position possibly needs to be reworked.     Kermit needs to address the topic at hand.=============================Robert Weisspsyrobtw@ubvms.cc.buffalo.edu	talk.religion.misc

How's that for an answer?  :-)Seriously, I believe that it depends on wether or not you aretalking about a governmental employer or not.  In this case, Ibelieve that there should be absolutely no discrimination,direct or indirect, period.  I feel this way not because it wouldoffend my moral sensibilities (which it of course would), butbecause the government is a coercive entity which we cannotescape.  It boggles my mind that in my lifetime, there were""whites only"" drinking fountains in some parks, but no fountainsfor others, yet the taxes garnished to support those fountainscertainly were not applied to ""whites only.""  In essence, wecannot escape the coercive state.  Even Randy Weavers have to payproperty tax.  On the other hand, private employers are not amonopoly, and their businesses should be run by them, and not bythe government, unless they elect to turn their affairs over tothat government.#> Why?

Each time the Peace Torch changes hands, theflame of oneness burns a little brighter - until one day it willshine in the hearts and minds of every individual on earth.		    ----  Making History  ----The three Peace Runs since 1987 have achieved some historic break-throughs: in the Middle East, a landmark run crossed the Egyptian-Israeli border; in Europe, a precedent-setting run linked Easternand Western Europe with Russia; in the United States, Mexico andCanada, entire cities were dedicated to the cause of world peace;and in Poland, the Peace Torch was blessed by Pope John Paul II.		 ----  Speaking as One: World  ----             ----  Leaders, Celebrities - and You  ----The Peace Run has won the support of leaders the world over -Presidents, Prime Ministers, religious leaders, sports figures andentertainment personalities.Its message has spread to a half billion people though newspaperreports, magazine articles and radio and TV broadcasts, includingspecials on PBS, MTV and NBC's Today Show.> ""I am happy to support your Peace Run for justice, peace andreconciliation.

There, runners from around the worldwere gathered for the fourth lighting of the Peace Torch.From there, Peace Torches are now being transported to overseventy countries for a series of concurrent international orcross-country relay runs including the United States, Canada,Japan, Australia, Russia and Eastern and Western Europe. Smallerruns will take place in the Philippines, Mexico, Israel, SouthAmerica, Egypt and elsewhere in Africa.

Each year the Teamputs on hundreds of athletic events, including several world-classultramarathons, marathons and triathlons, in dozens of countries.The Peace Run itself is inspired by the global peace ambassadorSri Chinmoy, who has written and lectured extensively on peace,offered hundreds of free peace concerts and met with countlessworld figures to advance the cause of international harmony.The Run is managed by Peace Runs International, a non-profitorganization based in the United States.               ----  Take a Step For Peace  ----The Peace Runs in 1987, 1989 and 1991 attracted nearly half amillion participants. We're expecting even more people to joinPeace Run '93.You can also join the Run - carrying the Peace Torch a few steps,a few blocks or a few miles. Or you can come out and cheer therunners as they carry the Torch through your community.You can also join local celebrities and government officials inone of the thousands of welcoming ceremonies scheduled along the70-nation route.Your inner support is important too.

In myleft eye a small detachment had begun already and apparently thelaser was used to ""weld"" this back in place as well.My right eye seems fine. In my left eye I was seeing occasionalflashes of bright light prior to the treatment. Since thetreatment (two weeks) these flashes are now occuring more often- several each hour.The opthamologist explained the flashes are caused because thevitreous body has attached to the retina and is pulling on it. Hesays this is not treatable and he hopes it may go away on its ownaccord - if it tugs enough I may well face retinal detachment.I am seeking (via sci.med) additional info on retinal detachments.The Dr. did not wish to spend much time with me in explanationsso I appreciate any further details anyone can provide. Of mostinterest to me:If my retina does detach what should be my immediate courseof action?If conventional surgery is need to repair the detachment what isthe procedure like and what kind of vision can I expectafterwards.Do the symptoms (fairly frequent flashes) imply that detachmentmaybe near at hand or is this not necessarily cause for alarm.Many thanksBill-- Bill Wilder, Computer Systems Manager Kentville Research StationAgriculture CanadaKentville, Nova Scotia"	sci.med

After reading the text some distinct questionsarised to me, which I guess will also be asked by other people. Perhapswould it be interesting to find an answer to these questions ?>                      THE CLIPPER CHIP: A TECHNICAL SUMMARY>    N, a 30-bit serial number (this length is subject to change)shorter or longer ?> Once the session key K is established, the Clipper Chip is used to> encrypt the conversation or message stream M (digitized voice).  The> telephone security device feeds K and M into the chip to produce two> values:>    E[M; K], the encrypted message stream, and>    E[E[K; U] + N; F], a law enforcement field ,> which are transmitted over the telephone line.  The law enforcement> field thus contains the session key K encrypted under the unit key U> concatenated with the serial number N, all encrypted under the family> key F.  The law enforcement field is decrypted by law enforcement after> an authorized wiretap has been installed.First question: When will the LawEnforcmentField be transmitted, and howdoes the remote Clipper Chip handle it? Is it transmitted periodicallyin the stream of encrypted blocks, or just at the beginning ? Does thephone at the other side discard those packets via a protocol whatsoever,or tries it to turn them into voice-output ? (Which would not be disturbing)> At the beginning of a session, a trusted agent from each of the two key> escrow agencies enters the vault.  Agent 1 enters a secret, random> 80-bit value S1 into the laptop and agent 2 enters a secret, random> 80-bit value S2. These random values serve as seeds to generate unit> keys for a sequence of serial numbers.  Thus, the unit keys are a> function of 160 secret, random bits, where each agent knows only 80.Second question: Why!?!? Why is such a strange procedure used, and nota real RNG ? This turns those S1,S2 in a kind of bottleneck for system-security.> When law enforcement has been authorized to tap an encrypted line, they> will first take the warrant to the service provider in order to get> access to the communications line.  Let us assume that the tap is in> place and that they have determined that the line is encrypted with the> Clipper Chip.  The law enforcement field is first decrypted with the> family key F, giving E[K; U] + N.  Documentation certifying that a tap> has been authorized for the party associated with serial number N is> then sent (e.g., via secure FAX) to each of the key escrow agents, who> return (e.g., also via secure FAX) U1 and U2.  U1 and U2 are XORed> together to produce the unit key U, and E[K; U] is decrypted to get the> session key K.  Finally the message stream is decrypted.  All this will> be accomplished through a special black box decoder.So no (technical) provision will be taken to place a 'timeout' on thesewarrants? This would be a unique possibility to realize such a technicalrestriction, by letting the escrow-agencies perform the decoding of thesession key. Just take modem-lines instead of secure fax. Is this sucha bad idea ?> A successor to the Clipper Chip, called ""Capstone"" by the government> and ""MYK-80"" by Mykotronx, has already been developed.

Some studies suggest that early exposure to various infectious diseases is probably beneficial because exposure as an adult carries much more risk of morbitity and mortality(mumps, measles. etc.).> -- How often do kids in their first, second and third years fall sick?> How often do they get colds, flus, ear infections?

But many viruses mutate and reexposure to the new strain requires another immune response(new antibody production).  In addition, antibody levels tend to decline with time and re-innoculation is needed to keep the antibody levels high.Chronic overstimulation of the immune response can lead to immunosupression but this is rare and very unlikely to occur in children.> -- Does taking antibiotics on a regular basis have any negative long> term effects?Yes, chronic use of antibiotics can have an adverse effect on the good bacteria that are supposed to be present in and on the body.  Health effects of this depletion of the good bacteria is a very hotly debated topic in the medical community with most physicians seeming to discount any health effects of chronic antibiotic use( a view that I do not support). > -- How does one tell if a child is more susceptible to illness than> normal, and what does one do about it?Chronic infection in an adult or a child needs to be worked up( in my opinion).  But most physicians feel that chronic infection in a child is normal because of both exposure and lack of prior immunity to many infectious diseases.  I do not share this view and there are some physicians who also suspect that diet plays a big role in infection frequency and severity.  Exposure to an infectious agent does not have to result in a severe infection.  A strong immune response can minimize the length of time needed to deal with the infection as well as the symptoms associated with the infection.> -- Is there any way to build immunity and resistance?There are five major nutrients that are responsible for a good strong immune response to infectious agents.  They are: protein, vitamin C, vitamin A, iron and zinc.  The American diet is not low in protein so this is rarely a problem.  But vitamin A, vitamin C, iron and zinc are often low and this lack of an adequate pool(nutrient reserve) can impair the immune response.  Iron is know to be low in most kids(as is vitamin A).  There are distinct biochemical tests that can be run to check the status of each of these nutrients in a patient who is having a problem with chronic severe infection.  Serum ferritin for iron status, dark adaptation for vitamin A status, red blood cell zinc for zinc status and leckocyte ascorbate for vitamin C status.  I have attempted to work up posts on these five nutrients and their role in infection for this news group as well as the others that I participate in.  I can e-mail you what I've worked up so far.But my best advice to you is to try to find a physician who recognizes the critical role that diet plays in the human immune response.  You may also be able to get help from a nutritionist.  Anyone can call themselves a nutritionist so you have to be very carefull.  You want to find someone(like myself) who has had some formal training and education in nutrition.Many Ph.D. programs in the U.S. now offer degrees in Nutrition and that's what you need to look for.  Some dieticians will also call themselves nutritionists but most dieticians have not had the biochemical training needed to run specialized nutritional assessment tests.  They are very good for getting general dietary advice from however.> Any data, information or advice relating to this would be much> appreciated.

Buehler)Subject: Re: Public/Private Revelation (formerly Re: Question about Virgin Mary(Marty Helgesen) writes:   When an alleged private revelation attracts sufficient attention,   the Church may investigate it.  If the investigation indicates a   likelihood that the alleged private revelation is in fact from God,   it will be approved.  That means that it can be preached in the   Church.  However, it is still true that no one is required to   believe that it came from God.  A Catholic is free to deny the   authenticity of even the most well attested and strongly approved   private revelations, such as those at Fatima and Lourdes.  (I   suspect that few if any Catholics do reject Fatima and Lourdes, but   if any do their rejection of them does not mean they are not   orthodox Catholics in good standing.)It may be a bit much to say that a Catholic is free to deny whathappened at Fatima.  That's a bit strong, it is sort of like sayingthat a Catholic is free to deny that Hong Kong exists.  What aCatholic *is* free to do is to deny the truth of Fatima, without beingcalled a heretic.  You can be labeled other things for such anoffense, but not a heretic.Theologians make a basic distinction as far as the degree of assentone must give to events like Fatima and Lourdes.  Things revealed byGod through Jesus Christ or His Apostles must be given the assent dueto a revelation of God: total and unswerving.  Fatima and Lourdesdemand our assent as much as any other well-attested event in humanhistory.  Perhaps a bit more, given the approval of the Church.""Approval"" of an apparition by the Church principally means thatwhatever happened was in harmony with the Catholic Faith.I personally think of private revelations as our Lord's way of tellingus what to do at particular periods in history.  He gave us all thedoctrines, etc., 2000 years ago, but we can always use some help inknowing how exactly to apply what He gave us.Catholic devotion to the Sacred Heart was a result of a series ofapparitions to St. Margaret Mary Alacoque, for example.  The problemat the time was extreme moral rigorism that was turning our Lord intosomeone without a heart.The Fatima apparitions were a warning of an impending crisis in theChurch (we are living it), and what to do to save the most soulspossible in such a situation."	soc.religion.christian

TRIAD, the first drag-free satellite, was designed and built by the Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory and launched 2 Sept 1972.  The satellite was in three sections separated by two booms.  The central section housed the DISCOS Disturbance Compensation System, which consisted of a proof mass of special non-magnetic alloy housed within a spherical cavity.  The proof mass flew a true gravitational orbit, free from drag and radiation pressure.  Teflon microthrusters kept the body of the satellite centered around the proof mass, thereby flying the entire satellite drag free.     TRIAD was one of the APL-designed Navy Navigation Satellites.  The 2nd-generation operational navigation satellites flying today (NOVA) use a single-axis version of DISCOS.  TRIAD was also the sixth APL satellite to be powered by an RTG (APL flew the first nuclear power supply in space, in 1961).

Using the 1992 Defensive Averages postedby Sherri Nichols (Thanks Sherri!), I've figured out some defensive statsfor the centerfielders. Hits Stolen have been redefined as ""Plays JuanGonzalez would not have made.""OK, I realize that's unfair.  Juan's probably the victim of pitching staff,fluke shots, and a monster park factor.  But let's put it this way:  If wereplaced every centerfielder in the league with someone with Kevin's 55.4% outmaking ability, how many extra hits would go by?To try and correlate it to reality a little more, I've calculated NetHits Stolen, based on the number of outs made compared to what a leagueaverage fielder would make.  By the same method I've calculated Net Extra Bases (doubles and triples let by).Finally, I throw all this into a a formula I call Defensive Contribution, orDCON :->.

This statement undermines>any good points you might have had (it was enough to make me stop reading).Sometimes I do come across condesending, and I am sorry I come across thatway at times.  Thank you for the reproach, I really do appreciate it.  I'lltry to get better.Rob, at the same time, I have also learned that some people respond to the gentleapproach while others respond only at a harsh rebuke.  Brian K., so far,only responds to the latter.  And I am glad he responds at all.   In bothcases of approach,  my intention is to be loving.  I am making no excusefor myself if I am coming across condesending.  I apologize for that.Rob, sometimes Brian K. comes across as honest. I know this.  But Brian K. vasillates back and forth.  One post looks honest; the next isan excuse.  Now he wants me to explain the universe in 50 words or less.  I think Brian Kendig is really trying but he is too comfortable withhis set of excuses.  I just want Brian K. to be honest with himself.  If he really wantsto know, he will ask questions and stop asserting irrelevant excuseswhich have nothing to do with my God.   I wish Brian would read theBible for himself and come to his own decisions without beingsidetracked with the temptation to mock God.From my perspective Rob, when I look at Brian Kendig, I see a manstanding out in the middle of a highway.  Off into the distance I see a Mack truck heading right for him, but Brian K. is faced awayfrom the oncoming truck.  He doesn't see it.   Here's is how I seethe dialog:Me:  ""Brian K, please step aside before you get run over."" BK:  ""There is no truck.""Me:  ""Turn around at look.""BK:  ""No.""Me:  ""Look!  You will be healthier if you do take a look at     the oncoming truck.""BK:  ""No. Explain to me why trucks exist.""Me:  ""Turn around or you will run over.""BK:  ""No. I won't because I like hiking and tomorrow is Tuesday.""Me:  ""You blind fool!  Why do you choose ignorance? You have nothing      to lose if you look.  But if do not look, you will certainly lose your life.""      I do not want to see you squashed all over the road.BK:  ""It is my life to lose.  I rather not look.      Besides, a truck running over me will not harm me.""      And by the way, I really have an open mind.""So is my motivation to belittle Brian, or to love Brian the best I know how?   I do not wish to single Brian Kendig out.  Because millions if notbillions of people fall into the same category.  Perhaps all peoplefall have fallen into this category at one time in their lives.  I have.I can now see the truck behind Brian.My hope is that Brian will look and will see the ramifications of thetruck coming towards him.  My hope is that Brian will want to step outof the way.  My fear, though,  is that Brian will instead choose to glue himselfto the middle of the highway, where he will certainly get run over.  But ifhe so chooses, he so chooses, and there is nothing I can do beyond thatto change his mind.   For it is his choice.   But at this very moment,Brian hasn't gotten even that far.  He is still at the point where hedoes not want to look.  Sure he moves his eyeball to appease me, but hishead will not turn around to see the entire picture.  So far he issatisfied with his glimpse of the mountains off in the distance. Thank you again Rob for your reproach.  I really do appreciate it.

The passage has *nothing* to do with the subject matter in which it lies.  It suddenly appears and then just as quickly disappears.Until you can demonstrate how and why the scholarly community is wrong aboutthe Josephus insert, your ""proof"" is meaningless and it should not be repeatedhere.  What's more, even if Josephus happened to be legitimate, it would ""prove""nothing.  Scholars speak of the ""weight of evidence.""  Far more independentevidence would be required to validate your claim.  Until forthcoming, yourbelief is based on faith.  That's OK, but you exceed your rights when you passfaith off as fact.As for the gospels, there are parallels, but there are also glaringinconsistencies and contradictions.  Shouldn't a perfect canon be perfect? Shouldn't there be absolutely no room for debate?  I suggest you read _Gospel Fictions_ by Randel Helms, and _The Unauthorized Version_ by Robin Fox (for Herb Huston, no known kinship or familial relationship, but we do indeed share an evolutionary ancestry).The fact that there are inconsistencies, gaps and contradictions does not denyyour position.  On the other hand, neither do the gospels ""prove"" your faith. Independent evidence is necessary, and I know of none (which we have alreadydiscussed, and so far you have not provided any).  Until then, its faith. Moreover, you have committed a fundamental error in logic.  You have attemptedto ""prove"" your claim with that which you want to prove.  Its no different thansaying ""I am right because I say so.""  Your logic is full of circles.  It reminds me a bit of the 1910 Presbyterian General Assembly.  The assembly defined five fundamentals (this is where""fundamentalist"" came from) of orthodox Protestant Christianity, to wit: 1)Jesus performed miracles, 2) Jesus was born of a virgin, 3) Jesus was bodilyresurrected, 4) Jesus' crucifixion atoned for human sin, and - here is theclincher - 5) the bible is the inerrant word of God.  Presbyterians construe""inerrant"" broadly as spritually inerrant.  Fundamentalists take thefirst four as literally true, and then validate them with a literally inerrantbible, which contains the first four, and which is the only thing known to contain the first four.  Smoke and mirrors and wands and hand waving if ever there was!Its faith, Bill.  You don't have any more or better truths than anyone else. Whatever works for you.  Just don't foist it on others.

"Newsgroup:rec.autosdocument_id: 103362From: kimgh@mentor.cc.purdue.edu (Gene Kim)Subject: REVIEW: 1989 Ford Taurus SHOReview of 1989 Ford Taurus SHO -- By Gene Kim=============================================Background:    Last week, I bought a 1989 Ford Taurus SHO, moving up from drivinga 1987 Toyota Celica ST and a 1975 Oldsmobile Cutlass.  I have beeninterested in buying a SHO for about five months and have been combingthe classifieds in Denver and Chicago every week.  I bought aremarkably clean maroon/red SHO with 92K miles on it for $6800.As far as I can tell, this is about $2000 under Blue Book and I stillhave another 8000 miles before the Extended Service Plan runs out.    As one should with any pre-1991 SHOs, I made sure that the car wasalready refit with the upgraded clutch and pressure plate, as well ashaving been recalled for upgraded rotors and seatbelt attachments.However, my SHO does not have the newer rod shifter -- I understand Ican get this for $230 from any Ford service center.  In addition, thecar received the full tune-up at 60K miles, receiving new platinumplugs and valve adjustment.    For a car with 92K miles on it, the car was virtually immaculate.The clearcoat paint job was devoid of any large chips or dents,although the front air-dam/molding was covered with lots of smallscratches -- not surprising since most of the miles were spent on thehighway.    Having driven a smaller two-door coupe for so long, I was a bitconcerned about whether I could get used to driving a larger car.  Tomy surprise, the size of the car doesn't bother me at all -- it seemsjust as nimble as my Celica!  (No comparisons with my Oldsmobile.  :-)Visibility from the driver's seat is excellent, helped mostly by ofthe small the quarter-windows, aft of the back-seat door windows andin front of the C-pillar and rear window.  Parallel parking is a bitmore difficult, but other than that, I love the size.    In fact, I'm starting to appreciate the large trunk as I pack upfor a 14-hour drive to Washington, DC for the summer.  More on theride later in this review.Engine:        As with anyone even slightly interested in SHOs, I was veryinterested in the 24-valve 3.0L Yamaha ""Shogun"" engine.  I was notdisappointed.  Base performance of the engine under 4000 rpms isgood.  You can even do reasonable launches from second gear, althoughI don't make a practice of this.  The engine revs smoothly and eagerly-- tooling around town does not require many shifts.  This is goodsince the shifter is definitely one of the weakest points of the car.(More on this later.)    While the performance of the engine under 4000 rpms may beunremarkable, it undergoes a Jekyll/Hyde transformation once you hithigher revs.  At 4500 rpms, a butterfly valve opens and you canliterally hear and feel the geometry of the engine changing as twelvemore valves open up.  The engine soars to its 7000 rpm redline, andyou are treated to, in my opinion, the sweetest sounding V6 around.The engine inexplicably sounds OVERJOYED to be at 6500 rpm!    I've noticed that when I drive around town, I constantly watch thetach to see how far below 4000 rpm I am.  To go from 2000 rpm to 4000,you may have to punch the accelerator -- while torque is more thanadequate, it doesn't come fully online until those other 12 valvesare used.Transmission:    When _Car and Driver_ first reviewed the car in 1988, theymarvelled at how Ford had put such a wimpy clutch and balky shifterinto the car.  I remember driving a friend's parent's SHO in 1990, andremember thinking about whether I had the leg strength to drive thecar in traffic -- the clutch was that stiff.  That was back then.    The entire clutch assembly on my SHO has been replaced under aFord recall in 1991.  The clutch on the SHO feels no stiffer than theone on my Toyota Celica.  In fact, the friction point seems a bitlarger and more forgiving.    When playing with the shifter with the car parked, the shifterfelt very reasonable.  The 1-2 and 3-4 gates were where you'd expectit to be, and the shifting action was smooth.  On the road, it'smuch the same -- but you have to shift SLOWLY!  Make no mistake, it'sa clumsy shifter.    When hurrying shifts, like when I was initially trying to impressfriends, I consistently miss the 1-2 shift, often grope clumsily forthe 2-3 shift, and sometimes even muff the 3-4 shift.  I find thispretty amazing in a car like this.    It also took me several days to realize that you get the smoothestshifts when you take your time.  Seems obvious, but compared to myToyota and my friend's Honda, this seems atrocious and clumsy.Someone on rec.autos noted that CRXs should blow SHOs off-the-linebecause of the incredibly clumsy shifter.    I now shift much more sedately, and the shifter seems morereasonable.  When you play within these bounds, the shifter workssmoothly with no surprises.  I don't know whether the rod shifterupgrade would help at all.    Along these same lines, I initially had trouble shifting gearssmoothly.  Again, slowing down the shifts and taking more care tomatch revs when letting out the clutch helped immensely.  This tookseveral days for me to get the hang of.  (I think some of my problemswere because I've never had a car with enough power to balk at badshifts in higher gears.)    Occasionally, I have trouble shifting into reverse.  The shifterrefuses to enter the gate, and I often grind the synchros trying to get it into gear.  I'll be watching this carefully in the next coupleof months.    A quirk:  When I upshift and the engine drops back to 1000-2500rpm, I hear a whirring and then a grinding noise coming from the theengine compartment.  Not terribly loud, but the passenger candefinitely hear it.  I asked about it when I was looking at the car,as do all my passengers.  Apparently, this is a definitely a ""SHOsound"" and is the gearbox -- apparently called ""gear rollover"".Replies to my queries on rec.autos are at the end of this review.Exterior:    As I mentioned before, I am astounded by how well the body of thisSHO has stood up.  Paint chipping on the front bumper and grille arevirtually non-existent.  Looking at how older Tauri sometimesdon't age so gracefully, I wonder what the guys at Ford diddifferently to the SHO bodies.    The body, in my opinion, is extremely attractive with matchingcolor body moldings than the stock Tauri.  For some odd reason, theSHO seems different enough from vanilla Tauri to get stares atstoplights -- of course, this could be my overactive imagination.:-)  SHOs get fog lights, a more open grille, a completelymonochromatic exterior, and a deeper ground skirt in the back with""SHO"" stenciled in relief.  I've seen a couple SHOs whose owners havecolored these in with florescent colors or in black.  Yuck.    I don't think the car is flashy.  I like it that way.  I feelalmost anonymous with all those Tauri out there, but different anddistinctive enough to those of us who care.  :-)Interior:    The interior is what really makes me feel like I don't deserve thecar.  The seats are grey leather, the steering wheel and shifter arecovered with black leather, and the entire instrument panel is done ina black/grey/metallic scheme.      The instrumentation is stock Taurus, except for the 140 mph speedoand 8000 rpm tach.  You get a center console with two cupholders, alarge compartment under the radio (great for a CD player), an armrestthat contains yet another compartment, three appropriately sized coinholders for tollways (I think), and a compartment for holdingcassette tapes.  There's map-holders in the doors, and an oddly smallglove compartment.    I spilled a whole can of Coke in the cupholder and was delightedto find that the entire rubber holder can be removed and washed in asink.  Hey, I'm really impressed with the ergonomics andthoughtfulness that went into its design.  And it's a 1989, before theinterior was upgraded!    The backseat is bigger than any car I've had.  Why do they need somuch space?  :-)  (No smart-ass comments, please.  :-)    The driver and passenger seat have lumbar and side bolsters.  Fromwhat I hear, it's not uncommon for the side bolsters to show wear.Mine is no exception.  The left side bolster on the driver's hascracked and I'm not convinced the right bolster is inflating all theway.    A big surprise for me:  I forgot that SHOs don't have a normalhand parking brake.  Instead, they have the regular parking brake thatyou press with your left foot.  Too bad.  Again, I'm getting used toit, but it seems a bit anachronistic to me.Ride:    The suspension is nice and stiff.  Too stiff?  It's stiffer thanany car I've had.  A friend's new 1993 Toyota Celica ST seems tauterand is still able to soak up bumps better.  The SHO seems stiffer withless ability to soak up bumps.  Driving over railroad tracks is anoisy and jarring affair.  On the other hand, taking turns feelswonderful because the body is so rigid and doesn't flex at all -- Ilistened for that before I bought the car.    On the highway, the ride is great.  When I drove the car fromChicago back to Purdue, I had trouble keeping under 85 mph, let alonefrom trying to see what 100 mph really feels like.  It's a relativelyquiet ride, but the sunroof rattles.  I've tried to find out whatexactly makes all the noise up there, but it seems to be the windowthat rests on the rails.  No easy way to get rid of it, I think.    Over the past three days, I've oscillated between thinking thesuspension is wonderful and perfect and thinking that the ride is waytoo rough.  (Not for me, mind you.  But I wonder whether I wouldadvise my dad to buy one for himself.)  But, I've discovered, as withthe shifter, if you take your time with shifts, you'll have no reasonto complain.  Let me explain...    The ride is worst when turning and applying lots of power to thewheels.  I feel the wheels scrabbling for traction and torque steermaking the car skitter left and right.  After I understood this, Iavoid the limits of traction -- and I'm a happy camper again.    It's not body rigidity, but the composure of the car.    As if matching the suspension, the steering feel is quite heavy.My first impression of driving my SHO was how hard you had to turn thewheel at highway speeds.  It tracks straight as an arrow, but whendriving around a parking lot, the high-effort steering didn't seem souseful.  However, it's reasonable, but it doesn't communicate the roadto the driver as well as a 1993 Ford Probe GT.  IMHO, it's much betterthan the steering on my Celica ST.    I wonder how bad this car is during winter?Miscellaneous notes:    GRIPES:    The rattles from the sunroof is intermittent -- some days it rattles        loudly, other days I look up wondering where all the noise went.    Activating the sunroof is sometimes very noisy -- loud squealing as	it retracts on its rails.  I wonder if there is a quick fix for this.	Again, other days it completely disappears.  (Function of humidity?)    Once I made the connection between the sometimes awful feeling suspension	and torque steer, I've never complained about ride.    I wish the seats had more support under the thighs.  Also, I wish the	side bolsters would close more tightly.      I hear that tires for this car can get really expensive.  I	currently have Goodyear GT+4s that cost the previous owner $500	for four.    I used to hate the Ford stereo systems -- whose idea was it	to use a volume *paddle*?  Now, to my amazement, I don't	really mind...  and sometimes think it's an okay idea!!!	Pretty ridiculous, though.    Getting up to 4000 rpm sometimes seems to be a chore.  But,	this is no big deal.  There is more than enough torque	down low.    I often goof up the shifting when driving with friends.  It	took me a couple of days before I could really shift	smoothly from 2nd to 3rd gear.  (Hard to believe, isn't it?)    My car has almost 93,000 miles on it.  My parents noted that	it is almost impossible to find a low-mileage SHO. 	Astute observation, IMHO.  I wonder how long I can make	my SHO last -- I just bought a book titled ""Drive It Forever""	for tips in this department.  :-)    The goofy parking brake pedal still throws me for a loop.  I once	parked the car in gear, and then accidentally let out the clutch	after I started it.  The car jolted forward, and bounced off	the car in front of me -- no paint damage at all, but starting the car 	is a whole new ritual for me with that fangled pedal!  Also, I began 	to wonder how strong that brake really is.  (Today, I backed out of 	parking spot today and started to drive away before I noticed 	the glowing brake light.  Oops.)    The driver's power window creaks when closed all the way.  The same    	thing happens in my parents 1989 Mercury Sable.  Oddly, all the	other windows work smoothly.    LIKES:    I'm liking the interior amenities more and more each day.  The    	cupholders are great.    I didn't expect to use the keyless entry buttons so much, but	it really is handy.  You can lock all the doors by	pressing the 7/8 and 9/10 buttons together!  Neat!  And	you can never lock yourself out of the car.    I really feel like I don't deserve this car.  I really can't	believe that I could afford it.  I got this car ten years 	ahead of schedule.  :-)    I love this car so much that I've been telling my parents to	look into buying one.  I love this car so much that I	wrote this 13K file -- I meant to write a couple of lines	and ended up with this.      If there were a J.D. Powers Survey for used car owners, I would have	an opportunity to express my incredible satisfaction of owning this 	car.  I don't like thinking about getting another car, but at this	point in time, I'm sure I'd buy another SHO.  For under $7000, you	can't beat it.  (Next time with an airbag and ABS, though.)    Insurance-wise, this car is also a big win.  I pay the same premiums	as on my 1987 Toyota Celica -- despite that it has nearly twice	the horsepower.  Other Odds and Ends:    Much to my amazement, there is no SHO mailing list anywhere.Maybe because the _SHO Registry_ publication has filled this void.  Ihaven't joined yet, but I've noticed that queries about SHOs stillappear on rec.autos about once a month.  Owners of SHOs are alwaysquick to respond, and are very vocal fans of the cars.  (Maybe someof the most vocal on rec.autos.  :-)    I've put together the responses to my questions about the cars, aswell as other posts with useful information on these cars.  I'll be posting this in the form of a FAQ soon.      If anyone is interested in starting a mailing list, please speak up!I don't know if I have the resources here at Purdue to start one, but maybe someone out there does.Gene Kim(genek@mentor.cc.purdue.edu)"	rec.autos

What do you think 75% of you is?But whatever the neutrons hit has a good chance of absorbing theneutron and becoming radioactive itself. Mostly, that means waterturning into (harmless) heavy water. But some neutrons would also hit bones, and the resulting harmfull, secondard radioactiveswould remain in the body for decades. I think an unshielded nuclearwarhead could reasonably be considered a public health hazard.As for a shielded warhead, I think a fair amount of maintainceis required for it to remain safely shielded (e.g. storage ina dry, temperature-regulated facility, etc...) For privateownership to be unregulated, I think a single individual mustbe able not only to keep the weapon, but keep it in a safecondition. If any random private citizen could not properlykeep, maintain and store a nuclear weapon, then some regulationis clearly appropriate.>>  Plus these things have no self->>defense purposes.

If you look at the American revolution as an example, the militias won by seperating themselvesfrom, and becoming independent of, a repressive government. Theydidn't overthrow it, and those communities (Canada and England, for example) that didn't defend themselves were still under that sameold regime. If the role of the militia were offensive, to go out anddestroy repressive governments, nuclear weapons _might_ be appropriate.But their jobs is defensive, and nuclear weapons aren't suitedfor that.There is also the question of personal and collective arms: TheSecond Amendment definately protects ownership of personalweapons (since the very nature of the militia requires membersto provide their own arms.) But it isn't clear if it coversother arms. Certainly, not all members would supply (for example)a tank, only a few could or (if they were to be used effectively)should. However, those providing the heavy weapons have a disproportionate control over the militia and its fierpower.The militias, as the framers envisioned them, were extremelydemocratic: If only 50% of the members supported the cause, only50% would respond to a muster, and the militia's firepower wouldbe proportionately reduced. Militia firepower and the popularwill were, therefore, linked. But if a small minority of themembers supplied a large fraction of the firepower (in theform of heavy weapons) this would all change: The militia'sfirepower would depend on the will of a small minority, notof the general public. Worse, that minority would be quitedifferent from the general public (at the very least, theywould be much richer.) As a result, I think the nature andcharacter of the militia requires that each member providea roughly equal share of the militia's firepower: His personalweapons, and some equitable fraction of a squad's heavier firepower.

It might be that pre-backproblems, he was quick enough to cover up any deficiencies the stancecaused, but now he's lost just enough bat speed that the stance hurtshim.

He changes his stance so much, he losestrack of where the strike zone is. In Wednesday's night game, he was clearly mad at strike calls on both corners that looked pretty good tome. I think he no longer knows where the strike zone really is becausehe's changed his stance so much.I'm also a bit concerned that because he's got Palmer and Gonzalez hittingall the homeruns, he'll become competitive, swing even harder and screwhimself up even worse.

There's no question that theNanao monitors are the best available this year, just as they were lastyear.  The difference between my ranking of the best in Windows and theranking in Windows Sources is due mainly to a difference in the testingcriteria and the scoring.  I used different tests than they did, and Iscored differently.  There's nothing wrong with the Mitsubishi, and itscored very highly in my tests, but it was a few points shy of perfect.Incidentally, one of the things everyone should do when they're readingreviews of any product, whether it's monitors or mice, is to read thecriteria and methodology carefully.  Unless you know how the producttesting was done, and on what the scores are based, you can't possiblyknow what they really mean.  Just seeing that I rank a monitor differentlyfrom Windows Sources is meaningless without knowing how we did theranking.  Likewise, it's impossible to tell whether a monitor will meetyour needs unless you know how we did the testing.  After all, some ofwhat we do may not apply to you.  Likewise, some of what we do may applymore closely in one review than in another.

The initiative will involve the creation of new products to   accelerate the development and use of advanced and secure   telecommunications networks and wireless communications links.   For too long there has been little or no dialogue between our   private sector and the law enforcement community to resolve the   tension between economic vitality and the real challenges of   protecting Americans.  Rather than use technology to accommodate   the sometimes competing interests of economic growth, privacy and   law enforcement, previous policies have pitted government against   industry and the rights of privacy against law enforcement.   Sophisticated encryption technology has been used for years to   protect electronic funds transfer.  It is now being used to   protect electronic mail and computer files.  While encryption   technology can help Americans protect business secrets and the   unauthorized release of personal information, it also can be used   by terrorists, drug dealers, and other criminals.   A state-of-the-art microcircuit called the ""Clipper Chip"" has   been developed by government engineers.  The chip represents a   new approach to encryption technology.  It can be used in new,   relatively inexpensive encryption devices that can be attached to   an ordinary telephone.  It scrambles telephone communications   using an encryption algorithm that is more powerful than many in   commercial use today.   This new technology will help companies protect proprietary   information, protect the privacy of personal phone conversations   and prevent unauthorized release of data transmitted   electronically.  At the same time this technology preserves the   ability of federal, state and local law enforcement agencies to   intercept lawfully the phone conversations of criminals.    A ""key-escrow"" system will be established to ensure that the   ""Clipper Chip"" is used to protect the privacy of law-abiding   Americans.  Each device containing the chip will have two unique				   2   ""keys,"" numbers that will be needed by authorized government   agencies to decode messages encoded by the device.  When the   device is manufactured, the two keys will be deposited separately   in two ""key-escrow"" data bases that will be established by the   Attorney General.  Access to these keys will be limited to   government officials with legal authorization to conduct a   wiretap.   The ""Clipper Chip"" technology provides law enforcement with no   new authorities to access the content of the private   conversations of Americans.   To demonstrate the effectiveness of this new technology, the   Attorney General will soon purchase several thousand of the new   devices.  In addition, respected experts from outside the   government will be offered access to the confidential details of   the algorithm to assess its capabilities and publicly report   their findings.   The chip is an important step in addressing the problem of   encryption's dual-edge sword:  encryption helps to protect the   privacy of individuals and industry, but it also can shield   criminals and terrorists.  We need the ""Clipper Chip"" and other   approaches that can both provide law-abiding citizens with access   to the encryption they need and prevent criminals from using it   to hide their illegal activities.  In order to assess technology   trends and explore new approaches (like the key-escrow system),   the President has directed government agencies to develop a   comprehensive policy on encryption that accommodates:	--   the privacy of our citizens, including the need to	     employ voice or data encryption for business purposes;	--   the ability of authorized officials to access telephone	     calls and data, under proper court or other legal	     order, when necessary to protect our citizens;	--   the effective and timely use of the most modern	     technology to build the National Information	     Infrastructure needed to promote economic growth and	     the competitiveness of American industry in the global	     marketplace; and 	--   the need of U.S. companies to manufacture and export	     high technology products.   The President has directed early and frequent consultations with   affected industries, the Congress and groups that advocate the   privacy rights of individuals as policy options are developed.				   3   The Administration is committed to working with the private   sector to spur the development of a National Information   Infrastructure which will use new telecommunications and computer   technologies to give Americans unprecedented access to   information.  This infrastructure of high-speed networks   (""information superhighways"") will transmit video, images, HDTV   programming, and huge data files as easily as today's telephone   system transmits voice.   Since encryption technology will play an increasingly important   role in that infrastructure, the Federal Government must act   quickly to develop consistent, comprehensive policies regarding   its use.  The Administration is committed to policies that   protect all Americans' right to privacy while also protecting   them from those who break the law.   Further information is provided in an accompanying fact sheet.    The provisions of the President's directive to acquire the new   encryption technology are also available.     For additional details, call Mat Heyman, National Institute of   Standards and Technology, (301) 975-2758.   ---------------------------------   QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ABOUT THE CLINTON ADMINISTRATION'S   TELECOMMUNICATIONS INITIATIVE   Q:   Does this approach expand the authority of government	agencies to listen in on phone conversations?   A:   No.  ""Clipper Chip"" technology provides law enforcement with	no new authorities to access the content of the private	conversations of Americans.   Q:   Suppose a law enforcement agency is conducting a wiretap on	a drug smuggling ring and intercepts a conversation	encrypted using the device.  What would they have to do to	decipher the message?   A:   They would have to obtain legal authorization, normally a	court order, to do the wiretap in the first place.  They	would then present documentation of this authorization to	the two entities responsible for safeguarding the keys and	obtain the keys for the device being used by the drug	smugglers.  The key is split into two parts, which are	stored separately in order to ensure the security of the key	escrow system.   Q:   Who will run the key-escrow data banks?   A:   The two key-escrow data banks will be run by two independent	entities.  At this point, the Department of Justice and the	Administration have yet to determine which agencies will	oversee the key-escrow data banks.   Q:   How strong is the security in the device?  How can I be sure	how strong the security is?     A:   This system is more secure than many other voice encryption	systems readily available today.  While the algorithm will	remain classified to protect the security of the key escrow	system, we are willing to invite an independent panel of	cryptography experts to evaluate the algorithm to assure all	potential users that there are no unrecognized	vulnerabilities.   Q:   Whose decision was it to propose this product?   A:   The National Security Council, the Justice Department, the	Commerce Department, and other key agencies were involved in	this decision.  This approach has been endorsed by the	President, the Vice President, and appropriate Cabinet	officials.   Q:   Who was consulted?  The Congress?  Industry?   A:   We have on-going discussions with Congress and industry on	encryption issues, and expect those discussions to intensify	as we carry out our review of encryption policy.  We have	briefed members of Congress and industry leaders on the	decisions related to this initiative.   Q:   Will the government provide the hardware to manufacturers?   A:   The government designed and developed the key access	encryption microcircuits, but it is not providing the	microcircuits to product manufacturers.  Product	manufacturers can acquire the microcircuits from the chip	manufacturer that produces them.   Q:   Who provides the ""Clipper Chip""?   A:   Mykotronx programs it at their facility in Torrance,	California, and will sell the chip to encryption device	manufacturers.  The programming function could be licensed	to other vendors in the future.   Q:   How do I buy one of these encryption devices?    A:   We expect several manufacturers to consider incorporating	the ""Clipper Chip"" into their devices.   Q:   If the Administration were unable to find a technological	solution like the one proposed, would the Administration be	willing to use legal remedies to restrict access to more	powerful encryption devices?   A:   This is a fundamental policy question which will be	considered during the broad policy review.  The key escrow	mechanism will provide Americans with an encryption product	that is more secure, more convenient, and less expensive	than others readily available today, but it is just one	piece of what must be the comprehensive approach to	encryption technology, which the Administration is	developing.	The Administration is not saying, ""since encryption	threatens the public safety and effective law enforcement,	we will prohibit it outright"" (as some countries have	effectively done); nor is the U.S. saying that ""every	American, as a matter of right, is entitled to an	unbreakable commercial encryption product.""  There is a	false ""tension"" created in the assessment that this issue is	an ""either-or"" proposition.  Rather, both concerns can be,	and in fact are, harmoniously balanced through a reasoned,	balanced approach such as is proposed with the ""Clipper	Chip"" and similar encryption techniques.   Q:   What does this decision indicate about how the Clinton	Administration's policy toward encryption will differ from	that of the Bush Administration?     A:   It indicates that we understand the importance of encryption	technology in telecommunications and computing and are	committed to working with industry and public-interest	groups to find innovative ways to protect Americans'	privacy, help businesses to compete, and ensure that law	enforcement agencies have the tools they need to fight crime	and terrorism.   Q:   Will the devices be exportable?  Will other devices that use	the government hardware?   A:   Voice encryption devices are subject to export control	requirements.  Case-by-case review for each export is	required to ensure appropriate use of these devices.  The	same is true for other encryption devices.  One of the	attractions of this technology is the protection it can give	to U.S. companies operating at home and abroad.  With this	in mind, we expect export licenses will be granted on a	case-by-case basis for U.S. companies seeking to use these	devices to secure their own communications abroad.  We plan	to review the possibility of permitting wider exportability	of these products."	sci.crypt

"Newsgroup:soc.religion.christiandocument_id: 21363From: jwindley@cheap.cs.utah.edu (Jay Windley)Subject: Mormon templesmserv@mozart.cc.iup.edu (Mail Server) writes:| One thing I don't understand is why being sacred should make the| temple rituals secret.The ""so sacred it's secret"" explanation is a bit misleading.  Whilethere is a profound reverence for the temple endowment, there is noinjunction against discussing the ceremony itself in public.  Butsince public discussion is often irreverent, most Mormons would ratherkeep silent than have a cherished practice maligned.But there are certain elements of the ceremony which participantsexplicitly covenant not to reveal except in conjunction with theceremony itself.| Granted, the Gnostic ""Christians""| had their secret rituals, but these seem to have been taken entirely| from pagan pre-Christian mystery religions.There are other interpretations to Christian history in this matter.One must recall that most of what we know about the Gnostics waswritten by their enemies.  Eusebius claims that Jesus imparted secretinformation to Peter, James, and John after His resurrection, and thatthose apostles transmitted that information to the rest of the Twelve(Eusebius, _Historia Ecclesiastica_ II 1:3-4).Irenaeus claims this information was passed on to the priests andbishops (_Against Heresies_ IV 33:8), but Eusebius disagrees.  Heclaims the secret ceremonies of the Christian church perished with theapostles.  Interestingly enough, Eusebius refers to the groups whichwe today call Gnostics as promulgators of a false gnosis (Eusebius,op. cit., III, 32:7-8).  His gripe was not that thay professed *a*gnosis, but that they had the *wrong* one.Writings dealing with Jesus' post-resurrection teachings emphasizesecrecy -- not so much a concealment as a policy of not teachingcertain things indiscriminately.  In one story, Simon Magus opens adialog with Peter on the nature of God.  Peter's response is ""You seemto me not to know what a father and a God is: But I could tell youboth whence souls are, and when and how they were made; but it is notpermitted to me now to disclose these things to you"" (_ClementineRecognitions_ II, 60).  If any one theme underlies the _Recognitions_it is the idea that certain doctrines are not to be idly taught, butcan be had after a certain level of spiritual maturity is reached.Now one can approach this and other such evidence in many ways.  Idon't intend that everyone interpret Christian history as I do, but Ibelieve that evidence exists (favorably interpreted, of course) ofearly Christian rites analogous to those practiced by Mormons today.| Neither New Testament| Christianity nor Biblical Judaism made a secret of their practices.But if Judaism and Christianity had such ceremonies, would you expectto read about them in public documents?  One can search the Book ofMormon and other Mormon scripture and find almost no information ontemple worship.  Yes, you could establish that Mormons worship intemples, but you would probably be hard pressed to characterize thatworship.  On that basis, can we conclude that the Bible explains *all*practices which might have taken place, and that absence of suchdescriptions proves they did not exist?Mormon scholar Dr. Hugh Nibley offers us a list of scriptures fromwhich I have taken a few:1. ""It is given unto you to know the mysteries of the kingdom ofheaven, but to them it is not given"" (Matt. 13:11).2. ""All men cannot receive this saying, save they to whom it is given""(Matt. 19:11).3. ""I have yet many things to say unto you, but ye cannot bear themnow"" (John 16:12).4. ""The time cometh, when I shall no more speak unto you in proverbs,but I shall shew you plainly of the Father"" (John 16:25).5. ""... unspeakable words, which it is not lawful for a man to utter""(1 Cor. 3:1-2).6. ""Many things ... I would not write with paper and ink; but I ...come unto you and speak face to face"" (2 Jn. 1:12).(Nibley, _Since Cumorah_, pp. 92-94)Again, these can also be interpreted many different ways.  I believethey serve to show that not all doctrines which could have been taughtwere actually taught openly.| I have heard that Joseph Smith took the entire| practice (i.e. both the ritual and the secrecy surrounding the ritual)| from the Freemasons.  Anybody in the know have any authoritative| information on whether or not this claim is true?Historically, Joseph Smith had been adiministering the templeendowment ceremony for nearly a year before joining the Freemasons.There is diary evidence which supports a claim that the rite did notchange after Smith became a Mason.  It can be argued that Smith hadample exposure to Masonic proceedings through the burlesque of histime and through his brother Hyrum (a Mason), though no specificconnection has yet been established.My conversations with Masons (with respect to temple ritetranscriptions which have appeared on the net) have led me to believethat the connection from Masonry to Mormonism is fairly tenuous.  Asour moderator notes, most of what was similar was removed in therecent revisions to the temple ceremony.  I believe that critics whocharge that Mormon rites were lifted from Freemasonry do not haveadequate knowledge of the rites in question.-- ------------------------------------------------------------------------         Jay Windley  *  University of Utah  *  Salt Lake City                    jwindley@asylum.cs.utah.edu------------------------------------------------------------------------"	soc.religion.christian

The reflected| ray (R) and the transmitted ray (T) is calculated from the formulae.| | Calling the routine recursively on R and T will return the colours | along the rays (R and T) as rCol and tCol.

First of all (this is NOT a snide response), if you're confused aboutthis issue, you will stumble over a lot of other things as well.  I suggestthat the weakness is your reference material.  Get ""An Introduction to RayTracing"" by Andrew Glassner for very good coverage of the raytracingalgorithm.  You could also refer to the 2nd edition of Foley & Van Dam.    On to the question.  The simple answer is that you just keep adding upall the contributions and then clamping at the maximum intensity.  Forexample, if your intensity values range from 0.0 to 1.0, then keep adding upand clamp the resultant values to 1.0 (you might have to clamp the lowerbound to 0.0 if you have dark bulbs, but that's another issue =^).  So, youget some illumination equation like this:        I = Lambient + Ldiffuse(light[n]) + Lreflected + Ltransparent    The contribution due to reflection is just summed with the lightintensity, as is the light due to transparency.  Now, a slightly lesshand-waving illumination equation is this:        I = KaLa + KdLd(light[n]) + KrLr + KtLt    That is, each component of the illumination equation is governed by thematerial constants Ka, Kd, Kr and Kt.  So the maximum you can get fromtransparency for a given object, for example, might be [0.4, 0.1, 0.5] for apurple-colored glass object.    Hopefully this answers your question.  I'll forward my ""illuminationequation sermon"" to you also.______________________________________________________________________________Steve Hollasch                                   Kubota Pacific Computer, Inc.hollasch@kpc.com                                 Santa Clara, California"	comp.graphics

At that village, whose name was publicizedthroughout the world, both sides suffered heavy casualties. We hadfour killed and nearly forty wounded. The number of casualties wasnearly forty percent of the total number of the attackers. The Arabtroops suffered casualties neraly three times as heavy. The fightingwas thus very severe. Yet the hostile propaganda, disseminatedthroughout the world, deliberately ignored the fact that the civilianpopulation of Dir Yassin was actually given a warning by us before thebattle began. One of our tenders carrying a loud speaker was stationedat the entrance to the village and it exhorted in Arabic all women,children and aged to leave their houses and to take shelter on theslopes of the hill.  By giving this humane warning our fighters threwaway the element of complete surprise, and thus increased their ownrisk in the ensuing battle. A substantial number of the inhabitantsobeyed the warning and they were unhurt. A few did not leave theirstone houses - perhaps because of the confusion. The fire of the enemywas murderous - to which the number of our casualties bears eloquenttestimony. Our men were compelled to fight for every house; toovercome the enemy they used large numbers of hand grenades. And thecivilians who had disregarded our warnings suffered inevitablecasualties.    ""The education which we gave our soldiers throughout the years ofrevolt was based on the observance of the traditional laws of war. Wenever broke them unless the enemy first did so and thus forced us, inaccordance with the accepted custom of war, to apply reprisals. I amconvinced, too, that our officers and men wished to avoid a singleunnecessary casualty in the Dir Yassin battle. But those who throwstones of denunciation at the conquerors of Dir Yassin [1] would dowell not to don the cloak of hypocrisy [2].    ""In connection with the capture of Dir Yassin the Jewish Agencyfound it necessary to send a letter of apology to Abdullah, whom Mr.Ben Gurion, at a moment of great political emotion, called 'the wiseruler who seeks the good of his people and this country.' The 'wiseruler,' whose mercenary forces demolished Gush Etzion and flung thebodies of its heroic defenders to birds of prey, replied with feudalsuperciliousness. He rejected the apology and replied that the Jewswere all to blame and that he did not believe in the existence of'dissidents.' Throughout the Arab world and the world at large a waveof lying propaganda was let loose about 'Jewish attrocities.'    ""The enemy propaganda was designed to besmirch our name. In theresult it helped us. Panic overwhelmed the Arabs of Eretz Israel.Kolonia village, which had previously repulsed every attack of theHaganah, was evacuated overnight and fell without further fighting.Beit-Iksa was also evacuated. These two places overlooked the mainroad; and their fall, together with the capture of Kastel by theHaganah, made it possible to keep open the road to Jerusalem. In therest of the country, too, the Arabs began to flee in terror, evenbefore they clashed with Jewish forces. Not what happened at DirYassin, but what was invented about Dir Yassin, helped to carve theway to our decisive victories on the battlefield. The legend of DirYassin helped us in particular in the saving of Tiberias and theconquest of Haifa.""[1] (A footnote from _The Revolt_, pp.226-7.) ""To counteract the lossof Dir yassin, a village of strategic importance, Arab headquarters atRamallah broadcast a crude atrocity story, alleging a massacre byIrgun troops of women and children in the village. Certain Jewishofficials, fearing the Irgun men as political rivals, seized upon thisArab gruel propaganda to smear the Irgun. An eminent Rabbi was inducedto reprimand the Irgun before he had time to sift the truth. Out ofevil, however, good came. This Arab propaganda spread a legend ofterror amongst Arabs and Arab troops, who were seized with panic atthe mention of Irgun soldiers. The legend was worth half a dozenbattalions to the forces of Israel. The `Dir Yassin Massacre' lieis still propagated by Jew-haters all over the world.""[2] In reference to denunciation of Dir Yassin by fellow Jews."	talk.politics.mideast

You still haven't offeredI've been watching this knife verses gun bit for a while now, (evencontributed a few comments) but this stuff ""I'd rather face a knife thana gun"" has GOT to come from ignorance!  I used to think pretty much thesame thing, then I got 'educated.'People do not as a rule understand how deadly knives can be, or howquickly you can be killed with one.  Most people don't understand thatit takes less than an inch of penetration in some areas to cause quick(within a minute or so) death.The death rates from handguns and knives are within a few percentagepoints of each other.  Many people not realizing how deadly knives are'try their luck' and thus more get injured by knives.  A gun is deadlyonly in a single direction and it's only advantage is that it is aremote control weapon.  A contact weapon such as a knife controls aspherical area 7 to 10 feet in diameter.Most people have never seen knife wounds, aside from slicing a finger byaccident.  From 21 feet or so, a knife is very nearly an even match fora holstered gun in experienced hands, even if the knife wielder has onlymoderate skill.  From inside 10 feet or so, a knife is a match for aDRAWN gun.  A knife is utterly silent, it never jams and never runs outof ammunition.  It is limited only by the speed, dexterity skill andability of it's wielder.  Criminals in general are young, fast andstrong.  It's interesting to note that the patterned slashing attacksused by many martial artists remarkably resemble the wild uncontrolledslashing attacks of novices.  I've talked to several well trainedmartial artists.  They have unanimously agreed that if they ever go upagainst a knife they simply plan on being cut, hopefully not as bad asthe attacker.Practicing with firearms requires facilities and equipment.  Practicingwith knives requires only a small area and something to simulate aknife, say a popsicle stick or tooth brush.  Criminals practice theirknife attacks in prison.If you have not trained against knives with a firearm and do not realizethese facts the first inkling you will have that something is wrong isthe knife ripping through your throat, or in the case of an experiencedattacker, parts of your body falling off onto the ground.  A 60 year oldman with arthritis can close that 7 yard distance and gut you in aboutone and a half seconds.  Dennis Tueller with a broken leg in a walkingcast managed it in two.  I've seen people close that distance and strikein 1 second.  I'm old, over weight and slow.  I can do it in 1.3seconds.  I've seen morgue footage of people killed with edged weaponsthat you would not believe.  (How about a single stab wound to the chestwith a TABLE FORK!  In this case the attacker used the HANDLE, not thepointed end.)Add to this the 'fact' that hand gun 'stopping' power is largely a myth.Except in the case of a central nervous system shot, or a round thatdestroys the skeletal structure, it takes anywhere from 3 to twelveseconds for a bullet wound to 'take effect.'This is true of even heart shots.  There is the case of the police womanin L.A., the first recorded survivor of a .357 shot to the heart.  Thatlady not only killed her attacker, but chased him down to do it!  Allfour of her shots, fired after SHE had been shot, struck the perp.  Attagirl!  The bullet entered her on a downward angle, went through the apexof her heart, down through the diaphragm, clipped her liver anddestroyed her spleen.  It then exited her back leaving a tennis ballsized hole.  She died about six times on the operating table, but wasout of the hospital in 15 days and was back on full duty in eightmonths!  She was off duty at the time and not wearing her vest.  She wason her way home so happened to have her gun.  No, she doesn't thinkcivilians should have the same rights.  Sigh.The moral of the story is that even if you DO manage to shoot a knifeattacker, you'd better be planning on doing some dodging.  A goodalternative is to shoot for and break the pelvis.  People can often walk(a little) on broken legs but a broken pelvis will nearly always anchorthem.  Many firearms schools recommend pelvis shots against contactweapons.  The target is as large as the traditional 'center of mass' andis more reliable to STOP somebody with a contact weapon, assuming acaliber powerful enough to 'do the job.'  Hot .38's on up will usuallydo this.Remember folks, the idea isn't to 'take em with you' but for you to liveand them to fail, whatever the consequences for them.  This the reason'killing them' isn't our goal, or in many cases even good enough to keepus alive.I don't want to face a violent attack of any sort.  Knowing what I nowknow, I can't rightly say I'd rather face a knife than an gun.  It wouldhave to depend on the attacker, and if I could pick and choose, IWOULDN'T BE THERE.  This is really the bottom line.  Criminals do notfear the law.  Criminals do not fear the weapon.  They fear the citizenbehind the weapon that has shown the resolution and determination to dowhatever it takes.Rick."	talk.politics.guns

Liberty is never free, it is always purchased at some cost, almost always at the cost to another.  Whos liberty is more inalienable?Similarly for right of life.  When one person must die if he is to saveanother, or even a group of others, whos life is more inalienable?  That leads into the classic question of the value of the death penalty, especially for serial killers.  Whos life and liberty is more valuable,the serial killer, or the victim?  According to that beautiful line,those two rights should be completely inviolate, that is, noone should beable to remove them.  This _includes_ government.  Admittedly the serialkiller has restricted some people's life and/or liberty, but is not hisown life/liberty inviolate also?

The comment about contact lenses not being an option for any remainingcorrection after RK and possibly after PRK is interresting.  Why isthis?  Does anyone know for sure whether this applies to PRK as well?Also, why is it possible to get a correction in PRK with involvement ofonly about 5% of the corneal depth, while RK is done to a depth of up to95%?  Why such a difference?  I thought the proceedures were simmilarwith the exception of a laser being the cutting tool in PRK.  I must notbe understanding all of the differences.In the FAQ, the vision was considered less clear after the surgery thanwith glasses alone.  If this is completly attributable to theintentional slight undercorrection, then it can be compensated for whennecessary with glasses (or contacts, if they CAN be worn afterall!).  Itis important to know if that is not the case, however, and some otherconsequence of the surgery would often interfere with clear vision.  Thefirst thing that came to my mind was a fogging of the lense, whichglasses couldn't help. would not help.-- | Daniel R.

For those who've nothad the pleasure:It is a MIDI controlled (no keyboard of it's own) rackmountable digital voiceprocessor.  What can it do with your voice?  It can pitch-shift it (change thenotes you sing).  It can add harmonies to your singing (up to 5 parts at onetime).  It can change your voice into a synthesizer's voice but leave whatyou say alone and intelligible.  This works well for a ""computerized"" soundingsinger, or robot voice.  For those of you who just thought about that, yes -you can do the voices from Robo-Cop, and the old ELO lead-ins with it, and yes -I'm a little red-faced to say that I tried those specifically.  For an input,it takes both: XLR (3-prong mic) and 1/4"" cables.  For output, you can havea combination of the original-input-only, and your choice of mix between theoriginal signal and the effect (can be effect only if desired).  It has presetsetups, which you can edit and save for your own preferences.  It has a coupleof light scratches, but does not look bad, and works flawlessly.  Even when wedon't use it in my music, it's been good for after-hours fun in the studio.The manual is included.  I never got around to getting rack-ears for it, butit has only gotten studio use from me - no roading, so it's not beaten.--       oooooooo       o     o                      Steve Hitch     oo      o     oo    oo       My opinions are my own.

I still believethat doing your own research is very, very necessary.  I wouldnot have progressed as much as I have today, unless I had spentthe many hours in Stanford's Med Library as I have done.And 5 years ago, it was clear that there was no medicine that would help me.  So should I have stopped searching.  Thankgoodness I didn't.  Now I found that there is indeed medicinethat helps me.  I think that what you've said is kind of idealistic.  That youwould go to one doctor, get a diagnosis, maybe get a secondopinion, and then move on with your life.Just as an example... having seen 6 of the top specialists in this field in the country, I have received 6 different diagnoses.These are the top names, the ones that people come to from all overthe country.  I have HAD to sort all of this out myself.  Goingto a support group (and in fact, HEADING that support group) was helpful for a while, but after a point, I found it veryunproductive.  It was much more productive to do library research,make phone calls and put together the pieces of the puzzle myself.A recent movie, Lorenzo's Oil, offers a perfect example of whatI'm talking about.  If you haven't seen it, you should.  It's nota put down of doctor's and neither is what I'm saying.  Doctors areonly human and can only do so much.  But there are those of usout here who are intelligent and able to sometimes find a missingpiece of the puzzle that might have otherwise gone unnoticed.I guess I'm biased because dizziness is one of those weird thingsthat is still so unknown.  If I had a broken arm, or a weak heart,or failing kidneys, I might not have the same opinion.  That's because those things are much more tangible and have much more concise definitions and treatments.  With dizziness, you just have todecide to live with it or decide to live with it while trying tofind your way out of it.I have chosen the latter.Lindalindae@netcom.netcom.com>>-- >---------------------------------------------------------------------------->Gordon Banks  N3JXP      | ""Skepticism is the chastity of the intellect, and>geb@cadre.dsl.pitt.edu   |  it is shameful to surrender it too soon."" >----------------------------------------------------------------------------"	sci.med

However, I don't know anyone who hasone.  I have my eye on two choices.Dexxa:  This scanner is available at Wal-Mart for $90.  It includes GrayWorkssoftware and provides 400 dpi and 32 grayscales (I think).  The OCR softwareCatchword is available through mail-order for about $90 also.Mustek:  (Gray Artist for Windows)  This scanner offers 256 grayscales(according to Cad & Graphics) and 800 dpi.  It is available for $169mail-order and comes with Perceive OCR and Picture Publisher LE.I am also looking at a Genius hand scanner (B105) from Cad & Graphics.  Itis basically the same as the Mustek scanner except for the resolution (400dpi) and price ($149).  Basically, I would like recommendations on which to buy.  I have heard thatLogitech makes the best and manufactures Dexxa scanners.  But which one is thebest buy?  Would 800 dpi really be helpful (output would be no better than HPLaserJet III or Canon BJ-200 - 300x300 to 360x360)?  I am leaning toward theMustek because it offers the most features and is in the middle in terms ofprices.  Which should I buy?If you have a hand scanner, please let me know whether or not you wouldrecommend it.  Also, if you know of another scanner within the price range(under $225) that would be a better deal, please E-Mail me.

XAll Rights Reserved.  Permission for personal, education or non-profit use is Xgranted provided this this copyright and notice are included in its entirety Xand remains unaltered.  All other uses must receive prior permission in writing Xfrom both Landon Curt Noll and Larry Bassel.XXABOUT THIS FILE:XX    This file is intended to help people who wish to submit entries toX    the International Obfuscated C Code Contest (IOCCC for short).XX    This is not the IOCCC rules, though it does contain comments aboutX    them.  The guidelines should be viewed as hints and suggestions.X    Entries that violate the guidelines but remain within the rules areX    allowed.  Even so, you are safer if you remain within the guidelines.XX    You should read the current IOCCC rules, prior to submitting entries.X    The rules are typically sent out with these guidelines.XXXWHAT IS NEW IN 1993:XX    The entry format is better (for us anyway).  The program mkentry.cX    has been updated.  See ENTRY FORMAT.XX    We will reject entries that cannot be compiled using an ANSI CX    compiler.  Certain old Obfuscation hacks that cause ANSI C compilers X    fits are no longer permitted.  Some of the new issues deal with X    non-integral array types, variable number of arguments, C preprocessor X    directives and the exit() function.  See OUR LIKES AND DISLIKES.XXXHINTS AND SUGGESTIONS:XX    You are encouraged to examine the winners of previous contests.  SeeX    FOR MORE INFORMATION for details on how to get previous winners.XX    Keep in mind that rules change from year to year, so some winning entriesX    may not be valid entries this year.  What was unique and novel one yearX    might be 'old' the next year.XX    An entry is usually examined in a number of ways.  We typically applyX    a number of tests to an entry:XX	* look at the original sourceX	* convert ANSI tri-graphs to ASCIIX	* C pre-process the source ignoring '#include' linesX	* C pre-process the source ignoring '#define' and '#include' linesX	* run it through a C beautifierX	* examine the algorithmX	* lint itX	* compile itX	* execute itXX    You should consider how your entry looks in each of the above tests.X    You should ask yourself if your entry remains obscure after it has beenX    'cleaned up' by the C pre-processor and a C beautifier.XX    Your entry need not do well under all, or in most tests.  In certainX    cases, a test is not important.  Entries that compete for theX    'strangest/most creative source layout' need not do as well asX    others in terms of their algorithm.  On the other hand, givenX    two such entries, we are more inclined to pick the entry thatX    does something interesting when you run it.XX    We try to avoid limiting creativity in our rules.  As such, we leaveX    the contest open for creative rule interpretation.  As in real lifeX    programming, interpreting a requirements document or a customer requestX    is important.  For this reason, we often award 'worst abuse of theX    rules' to an entry that illustrates this point in an ironic way.XX    If you do plan to abuse the rules, we suggest that you let us knowX    in the remarks section.  Please note that an invitation to abuseX    is not an invitation to break.  We are strict when it comes to theX    3217 byte size limit.  Also, abusing the entry format tends toX    annoy more than amuse.XX    We do realize that there are holes in the rules, and invite entriesX    to attempt to exploit them.  We will award 'worst abuse of the rules'X    and then plug the hole next year.  Even so, we will attempt to useX    the smallest plug needed, if not smaller.  :-)XX    Check out your program and be sure that it works.  We sometimes makeX    the effort to debug an entry that has a slight problem, particularlyX    in or near the final round.  On the other hand, we have seen someX    of the best entries fall down because they didn't work.XX    We tend to look down on a prime number printer, that claims thatX    16 is a prime number.  If you do have a bug, you are better offX    documenting it.  Noting ""this entry sometimes prints the 4th powerX    of a prime by mistake"" would save the above entry.  And sometimes,X    a strange bug/feature can even help the entry!  Of course, a correctlyX    working entry is best.XXXOUR LIKES AND DISLIKES:XX    Doing masses of #defines to obscure the source has become 'old'.  WeX    tend to 'see thru' masses of #defines due to our pre-processor testsX    that we apply.  Simply abusing #defines or -Dfoo=bar won't go as farX    as a program that is more well rounded in confusion.XX    Many ANSI C compilers dislike the following code, and so do we:XX	#define d defineX	#d foo		   <-- don't expect this to turn into #define fooXX	int i;X	j;		   <-- don't use such implicit type declarationX	int k;XX    We suggest that you compile your entry with an ANSI C compiler.  If you X    must use non-ANSI C, such as K&R C, you must avoid areas that result in X    compile/link errors for ANSI C compilers.XX    Unfortunately, ANSI C requires array indexes to be of integral type.X    Thus, the following classical obfuscation hacks are no longer allowed:XX	int i;X	char *c;X	i[c];		   <--- use c[i] insteadX	(i+3)[""string""];   <--- use ""string""[i+3] insteadXX    If your entry uses functions that have a variable number ofX    arguments, be careful. Systems implement va_list as a wide varietyX    of ways.  Because of this, a number of operations using va_list areX    not portable and must not be used:XX	* assigning a non-va_list variable to/from a va_list variableX	* casting a non-va_list variable into/from a va_list variableX	* passing a va_list variable to a function expecting a non-va_list argX	* passing a non-va_list variable to a function expecting a va_list argX	* performing arithmetic on va_list variablesX	* using va_list as a structure or unionXX    In particular, do not treat va_list variables as if they were a char **'s.XX    Avoid using <varargs.h>, use <stdarg.h> instead.XX    If you use C preprocessor directives (#define, #if, #ifdef, ...),X    the leading '#' must be the first character on a line.  While someX    C preprocessors allow whitespace the leading '#', many do not.XX    Because the exit() function returns void on some systems, entriesX    must not assume that it returns an int.XX    Small programs are best when they are short, obscure and concise.X    While such programs are not as complex as other winners, they doX    serve a useful purpose.  They are often the only program that peopleX    attempt to completely understand.  For this reason, we look forX    programs that are compact, and are instructional.XX    One line programs should be short one line programs, say around 80X    bytes long.  Getting close to 160 bytes is a bit too long in our opinion.XX    We tend to dislike programs that:XX	* are very hardware specificX	* are very OS or Un*x version specificX	     (index/strchr differences are ok, but socket/streams specificX	      code is likely not to be)X	* dump core or have compiler warningsX	     (it is ok only if you warn us in the 'remark' header item)X	* won't compile under both BSD or SYS V Un*xX	* abusing the build file to get around the size limitX	* obfuscate by excessive use of ANSI tri-graphsX	* are longer than they need to beX	* are similar to previous winnersX	* are identical to previous losers  :-)XX    Unless you are cramped for space, or unless you are entering theX    'best one liner' category, we suggest that you format your programX    in a more creative way than simply forming excessively long lines.XX    The build file should not be used to try and get around the sizeX    limit.  It is one thing to make use of a several -D's to help out,X    but it is quite another to use 200+ bytes of -D's in order toX    try and squeeze the source under the size limit.  You should feelX    free to make use of the build file space, but you are better offX    if you show some amount of restraint.XX    We allowed whitespace, and in certain cases ; { or } do not impactX    your program size (up to a certain point), because we want to getX    away from source that is simply a compact blob of characters.XX    Given two versions of the same program, one that is a compact blobX    of code, and the other that is formatted more like a typical CX    program, we tend to favor the second version.  Of course, a thirdX    version of the same program that is formatted in an interestingX    and/or obfuscated way, would definitely win over the first two!XX    We suggest that you avoid trying for the 'smallest self-replicating'X    program.  We are amazed at the many different sizes that claimX    to be the smallest.  There is nothing wrong with self-replicatingX    programs.  In fact, a number of winners have been self-replicating.X    You might want to avoid the claim of 'smallest', lest we (or others)X    know of a smaller one!XX    X client entries should be as portable as possible.  Entries thatX    adapt to a wide collection of environments will be favored.  Don'tX    depend on a particular type of display.  For example, don't dependX    on color or a given size.  Don't require backing store.XX    X client entries should avoid using X related libraries andX    software that is not in wide spread use.  We ask that such X clientX    entries restrict themselves to only the low level Xlib and theX    Athena widget set (libX11.a, libXaw.a, libXmu.a and libXt.a).X    Don't use M*tif, Xv*ew, or OpenL*ok toolkits, since not everyoneX    has them.  Avoid depending on a particular window manager.  NotX    everyone has X11r5, and some people are stuck back in X11r4 (orX    earlier), so try to target X11r5 without requiring X11r5.  BetterX    yet, try to make your entry run on all version 11 X Window Systems.XX    X client entries should not to depend on particular items onX    .Xdefaults.  If you must do so, be sure to note the required linesX    in the ---remark--- section.XX    We like programs that:XX	* are as concise and small as they need to beX	* do something at least quasi-interestingX	* pass lint without complaint (not a requirement, but it is nice)X	* are portableX	* are unique or novel in their obfuscation styleX	* MAKE USE OF A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT TYPES OF OBFUSCATIONX	* make us laugh and/or throw up  :-)XX    Some types of programs can't excel in some areas.  Of course, yourX    program doesn't have to excel in all areas, but doing well in severalX    areas really does help.XX    We freely admit that interesting, creative or humorous comments inX    the ---remark--- section helps your chance of winning.  If you had toX    read of many twisted entries, you too would enjoy a good laugh or two.X    We think the readers of the contest winners do as well.XX    Be creative!XXXENTRY FORMAT:XX    In order to help us process the many entries, we must request yourX    assistance by formatting your entries in a certain way.  This format,X    in addition, allows us to quickly separate information about theX    author from the program itself.  (see JUDGING PROCESS)XX    We have provided the program, mkentry, as an example of how toX    format entries.  You should be aware of the following warning thatX    is found in mkentry.c:XX	This program attempts to implement the IOCCC rules.  EveryX	attempt has been made to make sure that this program producesX	an entry that conforms to the contest rules.  In all cases,X	where this program differs from the contest rules, theX	contest rules will be used.  Be sure to check with theX	contest rules before submitting an entry.XX    You are not required to use mkentry.  It is convenient, however,X    as it attempts to uuencode the needed files, and attempt to checkX    the entry against the size rules.XX    If you have any suggestions, comments, fixes or complaints aboutX    the mkentry.c program, please send Email to the judges.  (see below)XX    The following is a sample entry:XX---entry---Xrule:	1993Xfix:	nXtitle:	chonglabXentry:	0Xdate:	Mon Mar  1 08:45:20 1993Xhost:	Un*x v6, pdp11/45X	2.9BSD, pdp11/70X---remark---X    This is a non-obfuscated obfuscated C program.XX    It is likely not to win a prize.

If an entry wins, we will renameX    its source and binary to avoid filename collision.  By tradition,X    we use the name of the entry's title, followed by an optionalX    digit in case of name conflicts.XX    If the above entry somehow won the 'least likely to win' award,X    we would use chonglab.c and chonglab.XX    If your entry depends on, or requires that your build, sourceX    and/or binary files be a particular name, please say so in theX    ---remark--- section.  If this case applies, it would be be helpfulX    if you did one of the following:XX	* Tell us how to change the filename(s) in your entry.XX	* Have the build file make copies of the files.  For example:XX		cc prog.c -o special_name		need special binaryXX	    or  rm -f special_src.c			need special sourceX		cp prog.c special_src.cX		cc special_src.c -o special_nameXX	    or  rm -f special_build			need special buildX		tail +4 build > special_buildX		sh < special_buildXX	* Assume that we will use the entry title.  Send us a version of X	  your build/program files that uses the name convention.  You X	  should uuencode these files in ---data--- sections.XX    If your entry needs to modify its source, info or binary files,X    please say so in the ---remark--- section.  You should try to avoidX    touching your original build, source and binary files.  You shouldX    arrange to make copies of the files you intend to modify.  ThisX    will allow people to re-generate your entry from scratch.XX    Remember that your entry may be built without a build file.  WeX    typically incorporate the build lines into a Makefile.  If theX    build file must exist, say so in the ---remark--- section.XX    If your entry needs special info files, you should uuencode themX    into ---info--- sections.  In the case of multiple info files,X    use multiple ---info--- sections.  If no info files are needed,X    then skip the ---info--- section.XX    Info files are intended to be input, or detailed information thatX    does not fit well into the ---remark--- section.  For example, anX    entry that implements a compiler might want to provide some sampleX    programs for the user to compile.  An entry might want to include aX    lengthy design document, that might not be appropriate for aX    'hints' file.XX    Info files should be used only to supplement your entry.  ForX    example, info files may provide sample input or detailedX    information about your entry.  Because they are supplemental,X    the entry should not require them exist.XX    In some cases, your info files might be renamed to avoid nameX    conflicts.  If info files should not be renamed for some reason,X    say so in the ---remark--- section.XX    Info files must uudecode into the current directory.  If theyX    absolutely must be renamed, or moved into a sub-directory, sayX    so in the ---remark--- section.XX    When submitting multiple entries, be sure that each entry hasX    a unique entry number from 0 to 7.  Your first entry shouldX    have entry number 0.XX    With the exception of the header, all text outside of the entryX    format may be ignored.  That is, don't place text outside of theX    entry and expect the judges to see it.  (Our decoding tools aren'tX    AI progs!) If you need tell the the something, put it in the X    ---remark--- section, or send a Email to the judges at:XX	...!{apple,pyramid,sun,uunet}!hoptoad!judges	(not the address forX	judges@toad.com					 submitting entries)X    X    The date should be given with respect to UTC.  (Some systems refer X    to this as GMT or GMT0)  The format of the date should be that as X    returned by asctime() in the C locale.  An example of such a string is:XX	Thr Apr 01 00:47:00 1993XX    This format is similar to the output of the date(1) command.  TheX    string does not include the timezone name before the year.  On many X    systems, one of the following command will produce a similar string:XX	date -u ""+%a %h %d %T 19%y""X	date -u | sed -e 's/... \(19[0-9][0-9]\)$/\1/'X	sh -c 'TZ=UTC date | sed -e ""s/... \(19[0-9][0-9]\)$/\1/""'X	sh -c 'TZ=GMT date | sed -e ""s/... \(19[0-9][0-9]\)$/\1/""'X	sh -c 'TZ=GMT0 date | sed -e ""s/... \(19[0-9][0-9]\)$/\1/""'XX    You are allowed to update/fix/revise your entry.  To do so, setX    the 'fix' line in the ---entry--- section to 'y' instead of 'n'.X    Be sure that the resubmittion uses the same title and entry numberX    as well, as these are used to determine which entry is to beX    replaced.XXXJUDGING PROCESS:XX    Entries are judged by Larry Bassel and Landon Curt Noll.XX    Entries are unpacked into individual directories.  The Email messageX    is unpacked into individual files, each containing:XX	---entry--- sectionX	all ---author--- sectionsX	all ---info--- sectionsX	---build--- sectionX	---program--- sectionX	any other text, including the Email message headersXX    Prior to judging, the 'any other text' file is scanned to be sureX    it does not contain useful information (or in case the entry wasX    malformed and did not unpack correctly).  Information from theX    ---author--- sections are not read until the judging process isX    complete, and then only from entries that have won an award.XX    The above process helps keep us biased for/against any one particularX    individual.  We are usually kept in the dark as much as you areX    until the final awards are given.  We like the surprise of findingX    out in the end, who won and where they were from.XX    We attempt to keep all entries anonymous, unless they win an award.X    Because the main 'prize' of winning is being announced, we make allX    attempts to send non-winners into oblivion.  We remove all non-winningX    files, and shred all related paper.  By tradition, we do not evenX    reveal the number of entries that we received.  (for the curious,X    we do indicate the volume of paper consumed when presenting the IOCCCX    winners at talks)XX    After the Usenix announcement, we attempt to send Email to theX    authors of the winning entries.  One reason we do this is to giveX    the authors a chance to comment on the way we have presented theirX    entry.  They are given the chance to correct mistakes, typos.  WeX    often accept their suggestions/comments about our remarks as well.X    This is done prior to posting the winners to the wide world.XX    Judging consists of a number of elimination rounds.  During a round,X    the collection of entries are divided into two roughly equal piles;X    the pile that advances on to the next round, and the pile that doesX    not.  We also re-examine the entries that were eliminated in theX    previous round.  Thus, an entry gets at least two readings.XX    A reading consists of a number of actions:XX	* reading the ---entry--- sectionX	* reading the uudecoded ---build--- sectionX	* reading the uudecoded ---program--- sectionX	* reading the uudecoded ---info--- section(s), if anyX	* passing the source thru the C pre-processorX	    shipping over any #include filesX	* performing a number of C beautify/cleanup edits on the sourceX	* passing the beautified source thru the C pre-processorX	    shipping over any #include filesXX    In later rounds, other actions are performed:XX	* linting the sourceX	* compiling/building the sourceX	* running the programX	* performing misc tests on the source and binaryXX    Until we reduce the stack of entries down to about 25 entries, entriesX    are judged on an individual basis.  An entry is set aside because itX    does not, in our opinion, meet the standard established by the round.X    When the number of entries thins to about 25 entries, we begin to formX    award categories.  Entries begin to compete with each other for awards.X    An entry often will compete in several categories.XX    The actual award category list will vary depending on the types of entriesX    we receive.  A typical category list might be:XX	* best small one line programX	* best small programX	* strangest/most creative source layoutX	* most useful obfuscated programX	* best game that is obfuscatedX	* most creatively obfuscated programX	* most deceptive C codeX	* best X client (see OUR LIKES AND DISLIKES)X	* best abuse of ANSI CX	* worst abuse of the rulesX	* <anything else so strange that it deserves an award>XX    We do not limit ourselves to this list.  For example, a few entries are soX    good/bad that they are declared winners at the start of the final round.X    We will invent awards categories for them, if necessary.XX    In the final round process, we perform the difficult tasks ofX    reducing the remaining entries (typically about 25) down to 8 or 10X    winners.  Often we are confident that the entries that make it intoX    the final round are definitely better than the ones that do notX    make it.  The selection of the winners out of the final round, isX    less clear cut.XX    Sometimes a final round entry good enough to win, but is beat outX    by a similar, but slightly better entry.  For this reason, it isX    sometimes worthwhile to re-enter an improved version of an entry X    that failed to win in a previous year.  This assumes, of course, X    that the entry is worth improving in the first place!XX    More often that not, we select a small entry (usually one line), aX    strange/creative layout entry, and an entry that abuses the contestX    rules in some way.XX    In the end, we traditionally pick one entry as 'best'.  Sometimes suchX    an entry simply far exceeds any of the other entry.  More often, theX    'best' is picked because it does well in a number of categories.XXXANNOUNCEMENT OF WINNERS:XX    The first announcement, occurs at a Summer Usenix conference.  By tradition,X    this is done during the latter part of the UUNET/IOCCC BOF, just prior toX    the Berkeley BSD, and BSDI BOF.XX    Winning entries will be posted in late June to the following groups:XX	    comp.lang.c		  comp.unix.wizards	alt.sourcesXX    In addition, pointers to these postings are posted to the followingXX	    comp.sources.d	  alt.sources.d		misc.miscX	    comp.sources.misc	  comp.windows.xXX    Winning entries will be deposited into the uunet archives.

I received 20responses and 4 requests for summary. Thanks to everyone who made itpossible.On my own I was able to find out about Codebase, Accsys, and Q+E. Codebaseand Accsys are C libraries without SQL. Q+E is a Windows applicationthat can be communicated through Windows DDE calls, where you send a SQLstring and receive the results.Most people wrote to tell me about the Paradox Engine from Borland. Other products mentioned were: Microsoft's ODBC, Accsys, Quadbase, Codebase,RBASE, and Q+E. Only ODBC, Quadbase, RBASE, and Q+E have SQL.For myself, I decided on Codebase, mostly because it has an ANSI Cportability version that runs under DOS, UNIX, etc, and includes thesource code, and portability is important in my application. It workswith DBASE, FoxPro, or Clipper files.However, I feel that Microsoft's ODBC looks very promising.It's mostly a formalisation of building and submitting SQL queries, andformatting query results. As the responses say, it's available via ftp,except it's effectively unusuable without two manuals:the ""ODBC Programmer's Reference"" and the ""ODBC SDK Guide"". Moreover,ODBC doesn't actually interpret SQL and liase with databases, that's up to drivers that should be provided by database manufacturers. Also,it's Windows only (it's actually an extension to the Windows SDK). Nevertheless, it's a start at a SQL interface standard, and shouldmake life interesting in the future.Here's my original post, followed by the responses, separated by a line of asterisks (*).> Does anyone know if Borland or Microsoft have libraries for accessing> their respective databases (Paradox, FoxPro) from within C programs?> I'd really like to be able to build a SQL query string and pass it> to a function which returns the query results in some format.

The current version is 3.0, which is fully compatible with (ack) Paradox4.0.  (Why the versions are different, I don't know. PD Engine 2.0 wascompatible with Pdox 3.0 and 3.5...).  It consists of a rather broadlibrary of functions for accesing database files from both Pascal (I thinkturbo Pascal 5.5 and up) and C (I think either Microsoft or Borland).Now.. reading the box... it's ""Borland Paradox Engine & DatabaseFrameworks"".  Works with any Borland C/C++, Mocrosoft C 6.01 or later,Turbo C++ for Windows, Turbo Pascal 6.0 or later, TP for Windows 1.0 orlater.  For Framework applications, BC++ 3.0 or later or MS C/C++ 7.0.

At least four federal agents and two cult members    were reported killed.  [...]    The gun battles began when federal agents hidden in livestock    trailers stormed the sect's head-quarters Sunday morning,             ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^    witnesses said.  The agents had warrants to search for guns and    explosives and to arrest Howell, said Les Stanford of the ATF in    Washington.  [...]    Witnesses said the law officers stormed the compound's main home,    throwing concussion grenades and screaming ""Come out,"" while three    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^    National Guard helicopters approached.  For a moment, there was no    response.  Then the shooting began.

In addition, it requirs anyonewith a used car dealer's license to own at least 10 cars at a time, all thetime. Let me continue with this example and try to answer Steve's questions.Steve, let's say you have the talent and inclination to fix up and resellcars.  Either you've gotten good enough at it in your spare time to bumpup against these limits, or you would like to do it full-time but thesestupid, arbitrary laws prevent you from starting out small and pullingyourself up.  So I'm protected from a hungry neighborhood competitor willingto take a low profit while working extra hard to fulfill my needs, and you'reprotected from doing what you want with your life.Here's what I see libertarianism offering you:Your money is truly yours; it belongs to you.  You can use it to buy a car.If you use it to buy a car, it is truly your car; it belongs to you.  Youcan use your money to fix up that car.  Since it is your car, you can sellthat car.Your life is truly yours; it belongs to you.  It matters not if someonethinks that it's ""wrong"" for you to buy and sell 10 cars within 12 monthsrather than, say, 9 cars.  They may dissaprove, but it is not their life ortheir money, it is your life and your money.My money is truly mine; it belongs to me.  I can use it to buy a car.Perhaps your car.  Perhaps that 10th car, the one that someone, somewheredissaproves of you selling and, presumably, of me buying.That someone could go to the government and insist that the government makeus stop it.  But the government would be powerless to stop us from doingwhat we like with our own property, in the abscence of fraud or agression.And it would be powerless to stop us from associating with each other.This does not seem to me to be a utopian dream, but basic human decencyand common sense.  A real grass-roots example of freedom and liberty.And yes, not having a few people acting as our masters, approving orrejecting each of our basic transactions with each other, does strike meas a wonderful way to improve the human condition.

We're talking prudent policy in>infant nutrition here, yet you're misrepresenting it as received wisdom.Who said anything about 'received wisdom'? There is no question thatorally administered doses of MSG are capable of destroying nearly allneurons in the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus and the medianeminence. These areas are responsible for the production ofhormones critical to normal neuroendocrine function and the normaldevelopment of the vertabrate organism. Humans are vertebrates. Nowwhat, pray tell, do you think will happen when the area of the brainnecessary for the normal rhythm of gonadotropin release is missing?Are you trying to say that humans have no need of their pituitary,ANH, and ME, of that part of the brain that is responsible forcontrolling the realease (albeit indirectly) of estradiol and testosterone? How do you expect anyone to do the studies on this? It's unethical to""sacrifice"" humans to check out what effects chronic, acute, etc dosesof these compounds are having on the brain tissue in humans.  The foodindustry knows this. That's why the animal model is used in medicineand psych.  If you're talking about straight sensitivity, it would beuseful to define the term.  There are plenty of studies onpsychoneuroimmunology showing the link between attitude andphysiology.I suspect we may be arguing about separate things; *only* adult sensitivities(You), and late-occuring sequelae of childhood ingestion and itsimplication for adults (me).  Certainlythe doses for excitotoxicity in adults are considerably larger thanfor the young, but the additivity of Glu and Asp, and their copiousand increased presence in modern processed foods (jointly), and theirhidden presence in HVP, necessitates extreme caution. Why would anyonewant to eat compounds which have been shown to markedly perturb theendocrine system in adults?  The main point is *blood levels*attained, and oral doses would likely have to be greater than SC. >>Between who? Over what? I would be most interested in seeing you>>provide peer-reviewed non-food-industry-funded citations to articles>>disputing that MSG has no effects whatsoever. >>You mean ""asserting"".  You're being intellectually dishonest (or just>plain confused), because you're conflating reports which do not necessarily>have anything to do with each other.

It says nothing about the frequent>inability to replicate anecdotal reports of MSG sensitivity in the lab.Olney's work provides a putative causal mechanism for somesensitivities. Terry, Epelbaum and Martin have shown that orallyadministered MSG causes changes in normal gonadotropic hormonefluctutations in adults. Glu also was found to induce immediate and persistantsupression of rhythmic GH secretion, and to induce rapid and transientrelease of prolactin in adults chronically exposed to MSG. GH isresponsible not only for control of growth during development, butalso converts glycogen into glucose. Could this be the cause ofheadaches? I don't know.>>>dyer@ursa-major.spdcc.com >>Hmm.

If you have corrections or answers to other frequently askedquestions that you would like included in this posting, send email toleech@cs.unc.edu (Jon Leech).    If you don't want to see the FAQ, add 'Frequently Asked Questions' toyour KILL file for this group (if you're not reading this with a newsreaderthat can kill articles by subject, you're out of luck).    The FAQ volume is excessive right now and will hopefully be trimmed downby rewriting and condensing over time. The FAQ postings are available inthe Ames SPACE archive in FAQ/faq<#>.    Good summaries will be accepted in place of the answers given here. Thepoint of this is to circulate existing information, and avoid rehashing oldanswers. Better to build on top than start again. Nothing more depressingthan rehashing old topics for the 100th time. References are providedbecause they give more complete information than any short generalization.    Questions fall into three basic types:    1) Where do I find some information about space?    Try your local public library first. The net is not a good place to ask    for general information. Ask INDIVIDUALS (by email) if you must. There    are other sources, use them, too. The net is a place for open ended    discussion.    2) I have an idea which would improve space flight?    Hope you aren't surprised, but 9,999 out of 10,000 have usually been    thought of before. Again, contact a direct individual source for    evaluation. NASA fields thousands of these each day.    3) Miscellanous queries.    These are addressed on a case-by-case basis in the following series of    FAQ postings.    SUGGESTIONS FOR BETTER NETIQUETTE    Read news.announce.newusers if you're on Usenet.    Minimize cross references, [Do you REALLY NEED to?]    Edit ""Subject:"" lines, especially if you're taking a tangent.    Send mail instead, avoid posting follow ups. (1 mail message worth	100 posts).    Internet mail readers: send requests to add/drop to SPACE-REQUEST	not SPACE.    Read all available articles before posting a follow-up. (Check all	references.)    Cut down attributed articles (leave only the points you're	responding to; remove signatures and headers). Summarize!    Put a return address in the body (signature) of your message (mail	or article), state your institution, etc. Don't assume the	'reply' function of mailers will work.    Use absolute dates. Post in a timely way. Don't post what everyone	will get on TV anyway.    Some editors and window systems do character count line wrapping:	keep lines under 80 characters for those using ASCII terminals	(use carriage returns).

"Newsgroup:comp.graphicsdocument_id: 38475From: zyeh@caspian.usc.edu (zhenghao yeh)Subject: Ellipse AgainHi! Everyone,Because no one has touched the problem I posted last week, I guessmy question was not so clear. Now I'd like to describe it in detail:The offset of an ellipse is the locus of the center of a circle whichrolls on the ellipse. In other words, the distance between the ellipseand its offset is same everywhere.This problem comes from the geometric measurement when a probe is used.The tip of the probe is a ball and the computer just outputs thepositions of the ball's center. Is the offset of an ellipse stillan ellipse? The answer is no! Ironically, DMIS - an American IndutrialStandard says it is ellipse. So almost all the software which wasimplemented on the base of DMIS was wrong. The software was also soldinternationaly. Imagine, how many people have or will suffer from this bug!!!How many qualified parts with ellipse were/will be discarded? And mostimportantly, how many defective parts with ellipse are/will be used?I was employed as a consultant by a company in Los Angeles last yearto specially solve this problem. I spent two months on analysis of thisproblem and six months on programming. Now my solution (nonlinear)is not ideal because I can only reconstruct an ellipse from its entireor half offset. It is very difficult to find the original ellipse froma quarter or a segment of its offset because the method I used is notanalytical. I am now wondering if I didn't touch the base and make thingscomplicated. Please give me a hint.I know you may argue this is not a CG problem. You are right, it is not.However, so many people involved in the problem ""sphere from 4 poits"".Why not an ellipse? And why not its offset?Please post here and let the others share our interests (I got several emails from our netters, they said they need thesummary of the answers).YehUSC"	comp.graphics

Specifically the 48-bit color?  That's 280: trillion colors, many more than the human eye can resolve.  Is this an anti-aliasing thing?  Or: is this just some magic number to make it work better with a certain processor.	I'm pretty sure most industry strength image processing specific systems (i.e. photo processing gear) use as much as 96 bits of color info.Why? Why not, oversampling is never a bad idea especially if thehardware's only task is image manipulation, and profressional photographersdemand professional results.: 	Also, to settle a bet with my roommate, what are SGI's flagship products?  I know of: Iris, Indigo, and Crimson, but what are the other ones, and which is their top-of-the-line?: (sadly, I have access to none of them.  Just a DEC 5000/25.  Sigh.)	Strange question, but anyway, there's the VGX line, the newerIndigo^2, and the Onyx systems are the new big boys on the block (youcan get a 24 processor system with twice the graphics performance ofa reality engine).

The facts are quitemuddled at this point and will likely be for quite a while.Secondly, things do not improve by pointing blame and accusatoryfingers.  Pointing fingers is a destructive action.  If everyonesat around pointing fingers all the time, nothing would get doneand nothing would ever get any better.  And despite the tragedy,we can learn something from this - if it is approached in a constructive manner.  Doesn't it seem that working together ismore productive than working against one another?Thirdly, it seems incredibly hypocritical to place blame giventhe benefit of hindsight - something that those who made thedecisions did not have the benefit of.  Why not give them the courtesyof acknowledging that they did the best they could with thedata they had - in a very, very difficult situation.  Someresponses have gone so far to suggest that the actions were donewithout regard for the lives of the people in the compound - giveme a break.Be part of the solution - not the problem.And that's MY opinion -david	talk.politics.misc
"Newsgroup:comp.os.ms-windows.miscdocument_id: 10011From: ashok@biochemistry.cwru.edu (Ashok Aiyar)Subject: Setting up a SLIP client under DOS and Windows (long)I have been posting monthly ""how-to-setup a SLIP client on a PC"" posts for a few months.  Lots of work, and imminent graduation have come in the way of posting one of these for March or earlier this month -- for which I apologize.This file includes information on writing a script for University of MinnesotaPHONE, and also a batch file hack that lets you use other packet drivers with PHONE. For additions, modifications and corrections, I can be reached at<ashok@biochemistry.cwru.edu>Best wishes,Ashok-- begin SLIP.TXT --Based on my experiences on setting up SLIP under DOS and Windows,  hereare my comments on setting up SLIP in this environment.  I thank theTrumpet beta testers and the CWRU SLIP beta testers for their comments.----------------------------------------------------------------------Configuring your Modem:a) Turn off DTR (AT&D0&W)   I have to disable DTR because the communication program that I use   to dial my SLIP server (QMODEM) drops DTR when I exit the program   and therefore hangs up the line.  If you use a program like Kermit   or Conex to establish the SLIP connection, then this need not be done.   These programs do not necessarily hangup the line when you exit.   NOTE: If you use Univ. of Minn. PHONE to dial and establish a         SLIP connection, you do not need to turn off DTR.b) Dial and establish the SLIP connection first.  This can be done   automatically if you use a program like PHONE (from the University of   Minnesota) which will dial and establish a SLIP connection then load the   SLIP packet driver.  The PHONE scripting language is simple and   phone scripts can be easily written to configure PHONE to work with   other SLIP server.  In addition, while the only packet driver   that PHONE works with is UMSLIP (currently), it is easy to write a   batch file hack that lets PHONE work with other packet drivers.   There is a section on PHONE in the document with both script and   batch file examples.----------------------------------------------------------------------Configuring the SLIP drivers:There are five SLIP packet drivers commonly availableCSLIPPER.EXE    Peter Tattam's compressed SLIP driverSLIPPER.EXE     Peter Tattam's SLIP driverSLIP8250.COM    Crynwr driver (I like Phil Burn's modified driver)ETHERSL.COM     Crynwr driver (ethernet simulation over SLIP)UMSLIP.COM      Univ. of Minnesota driver (based on SLIP8250)Of these four, I vastly prefer C/SLIPPER.EXE over SLIP8250.COM orETHERSL.COM for the following reasons:a) It is much faster even though my modem has just a 16450 UARTb) While using EtherSLIP/SLIP8250/UMSLIP, myself and several others   have noticed that the PC clock gets messed up after performing a   long FTP transfer.c) It supports PKTMUX when used in ethernet simulation moded) When used in Ethernet simulation mode C/SLIPPER seem to work with   every TCP/IP application that I have tested it with.Instructions for C/SLIPPER.EXE (and you do not use PHONE)a) Load SLIPPER in your AUTOEXEC.BAT file according to instructions:   For instance if you have a v.32bis modem on COM1   slipper com1 vec=62 baud=57600b) If you use DOS TCP/IP applications in Win 3.1 DOS boxes, then use the   double-ended packet driver shim WinPKT.COM -- this creates a virtual   packet driver at 0x60.  DOS applications in native mode, DOS   applications in Windows 3.1 DOS boxes and Windows applications can all   use this virtual driver at 0x60.   winpkt.com 0x60 0x62c) If you use QVT/Net, load PKTINT.COM next.  QVT/net is configured in   QVTNET.INI to use the interrupt at 0x60.   pktint.comInstructions for SLIP8250.COM:a) Try getting a version 10 SLIP driver.  Philip Burns of Northwestern   University has a modified SLIP8250.COM driver that is better at hardware   handshaking.  This driver is distributed along with NuPOP.b) Load the driver AFTER establishing the SLIP connection.  My modem is a   V.32bis modem on COM1, so here is how I would load the driver.   slip8250 -w 0x62 -h 4 SLIP 0x03f8 57600c) As discussed above if you use DOS TCP/IP applications in Windows 3.x   DOS boxes, you probably want to use WINPKT.COM   winpkt.com 0x60 0x62d) If you use WinQVT/net, load PKTINT.COM   pktint.comInstructions for ETHERSL.COM:If you choose to use ETHERSL.COM instead of SLIP8250.COM, theinstructions are exactly the same with one crucial difference.  Youwill have to DELETE the line ""device=*vcd"" from the [386Enh] sectionof SYSTEM.INI.  This will interfere with running regular Windows Commapplications (such as Crosstalk), and you will get lots of droppedcharacters etc. in these applications.  This is therefore notrecommended.  ETHERSLIP would be loaded as:   ethersl -w 0x62 -h 4 0x03f8 57600----------------------------------------------------------------------Configuring Windows 3.1:a) Make the following modifications to the SYSTEM.INI file [386Enh]   section.   i) List all your COM ports, with their addresses and interrupts.       COM1Base=03F8       COM1Irq=4       COM2Base=02F8       COM2Irq=3       COM3Base=03E8       COM3Irq=5       This can also be done from within Windows - Control Panel,       but double-clicking on the ""Ports"" icon.   ii) Give the port to which your modem is attached a generous COM buffer       COM1Buffer=10000   iii) Change the COM port AutoAssign value for the COM port that you wish       to use for your modem to ZERO.  This is the amount of time that       Windows waits in seconds before handing control of that COM port to       another application.  If you use WinQVT/net and then want to switch       from one session to another, and this value is at the default value       of 2 seconds, you are will get a GPF and Windows will crash.       COM1AutoAssign=0       This can also be done from within Windows - Control Panel.       Double-click on 386 Enhanced, and under ""Device Contention"", set       the device contention for the COM port your modem is on to       ""Never Warn""----------------------------------------------------------------------Additional notes:----------------------------------------------------------------------What to do if you are assigned a different IP address for eachSLIP session?I am fortunate in that our campus SLIP server assigns each usera permanent IP address, so I do not have worry about editing QVTNET.INIeach time that I establish a SLIP connection.If you are assigned a new IP address on every occasion that you dial in,please try to use BOOTP aware software, and let BOOTP do theconfiguration for you.  However, QVTnet is not BOOTP aware and RARPwill not work over a SLIP connection.  To get QVTNet working in asituation such as this, you must do the following:Edit the QVTNET.INI file.  Let the [net] section look like this:[net]name=ip=netmask=255.255.255.0 (or whatever is appropriate for you)arptime=20packet_vector=60 (or whatever is appropriate)Save the changes, and then *write-protect* this file""attrib +r qvtnet.ini""Start your slip connection, and *remember* the name and IP addressthat you are assigned.  Each time you start QVT/net 3.1x, thegeneral configuration dialog box will open.  Enter the name andIP address and you were assigned for that session, click on [OK],and you should be up and running.  The changes you make will notbe saved, as QVTNET.INI is write-protected.A more elegant solution to the problem of dynamic SLIP IP addressassignment is provided by Victor Menayang (victor@ccwf.cc.utexas.edu)Victor uses the program bootpq to semi-automate qvtnet preparation.Bootpq is used to inquire the assigned IP, which is then saved to afile called ""myip"".  Another file ""noip"" is essentially a completeQVTNET.INI file that lacks the IP address.  In the final step ""myip""and ""noip"" are copied into a single QVTNET.INI file.  An example ofVictor's batch file is provided below:=====================================================slipper com2pktint.combootpq -i ""ip=\""%%s\""""  >> myipbootpq -i ""My IP# is: %s""copy /q net + myip + noip e:\com\qvtnet\qvtnet.inidel /q myip@echo offecho .echo Ready to run WinQVTnet=====================================================For questions and more details about bootpq, please contact VictorMenayang (victor@ccwf.cc.utexas.edu)QPC Software is attempting to add BOOTP capability to WinQVT/net.----------------------------------------------------------------------How do you use PKTMUX over SLIP?PKTMUX will not work over the SLIP8250.COM packet driver, and crashesimmediately if used with ETHERSL.COMPKTMUX will work with C/SLIPPER.EXE, when C/SLIPPER is used in ethernetsimulation mode.  An example of this configuration is shown below:The latest release of PKTMUX is 1.2c; and it is important that youuse this version, if you want to use virtual packet drivers withapplications like Trumpet for Windows (to be released very shortly).[from AUTOEXEC.BAT]lh c/slipper com1 vec=65 baud=57600 ether         (packet driver)lh pktmux 5 65 /5       (pktmux loaded for 5 virtual packet drivers)lh pktdrv 7f 65         (first virtual packet driver used for QVT/net)lh pktint.com           (QVT/net pktint.com)pktdrv 63 65            (PKTDRV for use in native DOS or WinTrumpet)Additional virtual packet drivers can be loaded directly from withinWindows 3.1 DOS boxes.  For example, my PIF file to load POPmail isdirected to the file ""popmail.bat"".  This is what popmail.bat readslike:pktdrv 60 65            loads a virtual packet driver at 0x60cd \popmailpopmailcd \pktdrv 60 /u            unloads the packet driver at 0x60exit                    causes the DOS window to closeI have similar batch files that load other DOS TCP/IP applicationslike PC Gopher.  It is my experience that PKTMUX works fineeven if the virtual packet drivers in two independent virtual DOSsessions, are loaded at the same software interrupt.  For examplewithin two different DOS boxes -- one for POPmail and the other forGopher, the virtual packet driver (pktdrv) is loaded at 0x60 in eachinstance.----------------------------------------------------------------------How much does PKTMUX degrade the performance of C/SLIPPER?I have a V.32bis/V.42bis modem in a 386-33 running Windows 3.1 witha reasonably fast video card (ATI Graphics Ultra).  Under theseconditions, when I have three virtual packet drivers loaded andbeing used as follows:a) Driver at 0x7f -- QVTNet FTP client sessionb) Driver at 0x60 in one DOS Window -- CUTCP tn3270 sessionc) Driver at 0x60 in another DOS Window -- Trumpet for DOSI get FTP transfer rates of 0.8 - 1.0 kb/sec while transferringcompressed files.  This rate is comparable to that which I get withSLIP8250 loaded as a packet driver, and where a single TCP/IP sessionis active.  If CSLIPPER is used a packet driver and a single sessionis active, I get transfer rates of 1.3 - 1.4 kb/sec on the samefiles.While there is about 40% degradation in the performance of SLIPPER,for me the benefits of being able to use PKTMUX outweigh theperformance hit.----------------------------------------------------------------------C/SLIPPER and ethernet simulation modeIn ethernet simulation mode, C/SLIPPER ver 1.3 works with all theapplications that I have tested it with.  One or two applicationsthat required ethernet simulation balked at C/SLIPPER 1.2, but eventhese rare problems have been resolved with ver 1.3When SLIPPER is used in ethernet simulation mode, and used with PKTMUX,I get some an error message in the QVTNet Console window that reads""IP:incorrect packet type"" or ""IP:bad version number"".  This does notseem to prevent QVTnet from functioning, although I cannot comment onloss of performance.----------------------------------------------------------------------What can you do if your DOS TCP/IP application does not work withC/SLIPPER in ethernet simulation mode?In the rare event that you find a package that does not work withC/SLIPPER in ethernet simulation mode, first contact the author --Peter Tattam -- PETER@psychnet.psychol.utas.edu.au, and let himknow.  Chances are that he can fix it.In the meanwhile, you can try the following.  I do not know if it iskosher, but it worked when I had problems with C/SLIPPER ver 1.2(C/SLIPPER is loaded at 0x62 as described above under the PKTMUX section)I load ETHERSL.COM at 0x60, run the application and then terminateETHERSL.COMThis also works within Windows 3.1 virtual DOS boxes.  However apacket driver like ETHERSL can be used in only one virtual DOS boxat a time.So for example, here is my batch file to run Grateful Med (amedical reference retrieval program developed at the National Libraryof Medicine).ethersl -w 0x60 -h 4 0x03f8 57600       loads ETHERSLIPcd \gm6searchcd \termin 0x60                             terminates ETHERSLIPexit            closes the DOS box and returns me to WindowsIf you use this method, be cautious about one thing -- don't haveany active PKTMUX DOS sessions open at the same time.  After closingthe ETHERSL window, you can run your PKTMUX DOS sessions with noproblem.  BTW, the example above -- Grateful Med, works with noproblems with C/SLIPPER ver 1.3----------------------------------------------------------------------PHONE Script Files:The documentation that accompany PHONE, provide good instructions onwriting script files to get PHONE to dial SLIP servers other thanthe University of Minnesota server.  For example here is a scriptthat I use to dial a CISCO server at the University that I attend.Background:  To start a SLIP connection, I dial our terminal server,and login with a username and password.  After doing so, I start a SLIPsession with the following command ""slip username-slip.dialin.cwru.edu"",followed by my password -- again.Here then is the relevant portion of the PHONE.CMD script file -## CWRU-TS2 SLIP login script by Ashok Aiyar 3/26/93# Last revised 3/28/93Procedure    Host.CWRU.LoginTimeOut 60      'CWRU-TS2 terminal server is not responding'Message         ""CWRU-TS2 SLIP login script -- Version 1.1""Message         'Waiting for SLIP server to respond'Quiet ONExpect 'Verification'Message         'Request for User Verification Received from CWRU-TS2'Message         'Sending your user name and password'Quiet OFFExpect   'Username:'Send '%u<'Expect   'Password:'PrivateSend '%p<'Reject    'Access denied'   'Your user name or password was not accepted'TimeOut 30    'SLIP server did not respond to your validation request'Expect 'CWRU-TS2>'Send 'SLIP<'TimeOut 10    'SLIP server did not respond to SLIP command'Expect 'IP hostname or address:'Send '%u-slip.dialin.cwru.edu<'TimeOut 10 'SLIP server did not respond to hostname'Reject    'Bad IP address'   'Incorrect Hostname'Expect 'Password:'Send '%p<'Reject    'Access denied'    'Password not accepted.'TimeOut 10Expect 'Header Compression will match your system'Message 'Login to CWRU SLIP server successful'Wait 1.0EndProcedure   Host.CWRU.Login##Procedure      Host.CWRU.LogOut# Nothing special needs to be done to logoutEndProcedure   Host.CWRU.LogOut##   End of Script file#----------------------------------------------------------------------How to use packet drivers other than UMSLIP with PHONE?The quick answer -- there is no ""clean"" way.  Below is a batch filehack that I wrote to use PHONE with other packet drivers.  In thisexample, the packet driver is Peter Tattam's CSLIPPER.  To use abatch file like this, you must know the parameters with which youplan to use the packet driver -- i.e interrupt vector, baud rate,port address, and IRQ.  This batch file requires UMSLIP.COM,CSLIPPER.EXE, and TERMIN.COM to be in the same directoryor in your path ...All that the BATCH file does is to let you dial the SLIP connectionusing PHONE, load the appropriate packet driver, hangup theconnection, and unload the driver when you are done ...-- being CWRUSLIP.BAT --@echo offrem   this batch file is an ugly hack of U. of Minn.

So far, Israe continues to propose that they remain. The Palestinians propose that they leave. Why should either change their view? It is worth pointing out that the only area of compromise accomodating both views seems to require areduction in the Israeli presence. Israel proposes no such reduction....and in fact may be said to *not* be negotiating.------------------------------------------------------------------------Tim: There seem to be two perceptions that **have to be addressed**. Thefirst is that of Israel, where there is little trust for Arab groups, sothere is little support for Israel giving up **tangible** assets in exchange for pieces of paper, ""expectations"", ""hopes"", etc. The secondis that of the Arab world/Palestinians, where there is the demand thatthese ""tangible concessions"" be made by Israel **without** it receivinganything **tangible** back.  Given this, the gap between the two stancesseems to be the need by Israel of receiving some ***tangible*** returnsfor its expected concessions. By ""tangible"" is meant something that1) provides Israel with ""comparable"" protection (from the land it is to give up), 2) in some way ensures that the Arab states and Palestine **will be** accountable and held actively (not just ""diplomatically) responsible for the upholding of all actions on its territory (by citizens or ""visitors"").In essence I do not believe that Israel objections to Palestinianstatehood would be anywhere near as strong as they are now IF Israelwas assured that any new Palestinian state *would be committed to** co-existing with Israel and held responsible for ALL attacks on Israel from its territory.	Aside from some of the rather slanted proposals above,	how *could* such ""guarantees"" be instilled? For example,	how could such ""guarantees""/""controls"" be added to the	Palestinian PISGA proposals?Israel is hanging on largely because it is scared stiff that the minuteit lets go (gives lands back to Arab states, no more ""buffer zone"", givesfull autonomy to Palestinians), ANY and/or ALL of the Arab partiescould (and *would*, if not ""controlled"" somehow) EASILY return to the traditional anti-Israel position. The question then is HOW to *really*ensure that that will not happen.Tim"	talk.politics.mideast

Increasing this value increases the	amount of available linear address space, causing the size of data	structures to increase.

If Mary was Immaculately concieved, so she   could be a pure vessel, does this mean that she was without sin   and, therefore, the perfect (meaning sinless) female human being?   Is this why she is held so highly in the Catholic Church despite   it's basically patriarchical structure?She was immaculately conceived, and so never subject to Original Sin,but also never committed a personal sin in her whole life.  This waspossible because of the special degree of grace granted to her by God.She is regarded so highly because of her special relationship to God,and everything that flows from that relationship.The Catholic Church sees her as the new Eve.  (The Fathers in theearly Church use this particular figure a lot.)Eve is the mother of all the living in a genetic sense.  Mary is themother of all the living in the order of grace.  As sin came throughEve, so Grace -- Jesus Christ -- came through Mary.	soc.religion.christian
"Newsgroup:soc.religion.christiandocument_id: 20937From: REXLEX@fnal.fnal.govSubject: Assurance of HellI dreamed that the great judgment morning had dawned,     and the trumpet had blown.I dreamed that the sinners had gathered for judgment     before the white throne.Oh what weeping and wailing as the lost were told of their fate.They cried for the rock and the mountains.They prayed, but their prayers were too late.The soul that had put off salvation, ""Not tonight I'll get saved by and by. No time now to think of ....... religion,"" Alas, he had found time to die.And I saw a Great White Throne.Now, some have protest by saying that the fear of hell is not good formotivation, yet Jesus thought it was.  Paul thought it was.  Paul said, ""Knowing therefore, the terror of the Lord, we persuade men.""Today, too much of our evangelism is nothing but soft soap and some ofit is nothing but evangelical salesmanship.  We don't tell people anymore, thatthere's such a thing as sin or that there's such a place as hell.  As Jayne has said, this doesn't mean we have to come on so strong so as to hitpeople over the head with a baseball bat.  Yet the fact remains, there is aplace called hell.  A place so fearful that God died to save us from having toexperience it.  Whatever you or I, as Christians, do, we should do whatever wecan to win people to the Lord, if for no other reason, to keep them from goingto ""outer darkness."".  Jesus, in Mt. 25, tells us that He didn't prepare hell for people.  He preparedit for the Devil and his angels.  No where in the Bible do I read -anywhere,that God predestined anybody to go to hell.  D.L. Moody use to say that theelect are the ""whosoever will"" and the nonelect are the ""whosoever wont's."" Whether or not that's theologically sound, I couldn't defend, but itspractical.  Jesus said to the people of Israel, ""Ye would not.""  Now, some of you may not be students of the Bible, heck -some of you may not beChristians.  Have you ever said to somebody, ""I don't believe in hell.  Ibelieve in the religion of Jesus.""  But did you know that Jesus talked moreabout hell than He did about heaven!  ""Oh I believe in the religion of thesermon on the mount.""  You find hell taught by Jesus in the sermon on themount.  You'll read that Jesus talked about the tree being cast into the fire. Several times he talks about hell and about judgment.  In fact, over and overin the synoptics, Matthew, Mark and Luke, Jesus talks about hell.  Not Isaiah. Not Moses.  Not John the Baptist, though he did, but Jesus, the Son of God. The great Beloved One preached about hell because He loved people and didn'twant to see them go there.Now, if there is no hell then Jesus preached in vain.  It was our Lord Jesus,not some angry Baptist preacher, that said, ""where the worm never dies, andwhere the fire never goes out.""  Jesus said that.  It was Jesus who called hella ""furnace of fire.""  It was Jesus that used the word, ""condemnation.""  ""Andthis is the condemnation, that men love darkness rather than light becausetheir deeds are evil.  Jesus said that.  How can we get it across to you that a loving, dying Jesus preached about hell? Not only that, but He went through hell.  That's what Calgary was all about. When my Lord was on the cross, darkness fell.  He called hell, ""outerdarkness.""  Do you have this idea that hell is a place where the gamblers are gambling overhere, the drunks are getting drunk over there, and the prostitutes areprostituting their bodies over there?  That's not what hell is.  Hell's not aparty.  There's no fellowship there.  He called it ""outer darkness.""  ""Outer""-away from God.  ""Darkness"" -God is light.  No when He was on the cross, He was made sin for you and for me.  God treatedJesus the way sinners have to be treated.  That's is a sobering thought.  As myson would say, an ""awesome"" thought.  ""My God, My God why hast Thou forsaken me?""  Hell is isolation.  There's nofellowship in hell.  There's no friendship in hell.  There's no loving embracein hell.  There's no hand shake in hell.  There's no word of encouragement inhell.  ""I thirst.""  It goes much deeper than physical thirst.  Hell is eternal cravingwith no satisfaction.  The man whose life was lived for drugs, will crave iteternally.  The man whose life was lived for the lust of a woman's body, willcrave it eternally -and not be satisfied.  One theologian has put it this wayand I think it deserves merit.  What is hell?  Hell is just the kind ofenvironment that matches the internal condition of the lost.  In a recent post, I was trying to remember the founder of The Word of Lifeministries.  I've remembered his name, Jack Wertzen, and found that theillustration that I gave wasn't his.  His illustration was that he was talkingto his barber and his barber's wife and daughter had just recently been savedand he was commenting about it to Jack.  ""They sing these songs and read Bibleverses, and their praising this and that -I can't stand it!  Jack, do you thinkGod would send me to hell?""  Jack answered by saying, ""Yes I think he would!"" Of course the barber said, ""What do you mean by that.""  ""Well if you can'tstand living at home with your wife and daughter who sing hymns and praises toGod now, what would you do in heaven where they'll do it for eternity?  You'dbe miserable.  Because God loves you, He'd put you where it would match whatyou really are.""   It makes a man think.The crucifixion of Jesus Christ is a fact that necessitates the eternalexistence of hell because on the cross He performed an eternal act.  Don't askme how, I don't know.  But He is God and He is the infinite/eternal and when Hedied, He died an infinite/eternal death.  It is by that eternal act that Hepurchased eternal life for the ""whosoever wills.""  He suffered eternaljudgment.  A lot of people would like to detour around hell by saying ""Everybody is goingto be saved eventually.""  -universalism.  My Bible says no, He'll separatethem.  The sheep from the goats.  "".After you die there's a probationary periodin which God prepares you for heaven.""  No, my Bible says that ""It is appointedunto men once to die and then comes judgment.""  Some of the cultist believe inannihilation.  After you die, sssswish.  Just like a mosquito you're squishedout.  No, in Rev we are told that their is eternal existence in hell just asthere is in heaven.  I don't enjoy making these kind of statements and maybe you don't enjoylistening to them, but we have to preach the entire Word of God.  -There is aplace called hell.  If I could give one verse of Scripture that could give anyhope that people aren't going there, I'd give it to you, but I haven't foundit.  That fact that there is a place called hell, the fact that our God is aGod of holiness and must judge sin, the fact that He has made us the kind ofcreatures we are and therefore we're responsible, the fact that He has placedus in a ""uni""verse that has purpose and design behind it, the fact that sin issuch an awful thing and the fact that God Himself went through hell to save usfrom hell leads us to two applications.1)  As I've already mentioned.  If you are a Christian, you must worn others. Its not good enough to stop and fix their flat tire and not tell them that justaround the bend the bridge is out.  ""Knowing therefore the terror of Lord, wepersuade men.""2)  If you haven't accepted Jesus are your Savior, you're taking an awfulchance.  As I say to the Jehovah Witnesses (who no longer frequent my door), ifyou are right and I am wrong, then I will have lived a good life and will dieand cease to exist, but if I am right and you are wrong, then you will die andsuffer eternal damnation.  I don't mean to make fun at this point, but its likeDirty Harry said, ""You've got to ask yourself, 'Do I feel lucky?'  Well doyou?""  ""A man's got to know his limitations.""  Don't be one of the ""whosoeverwont's.""  ""Because while I was yet a sinner, He died for me.""""There's no greater love than this, that a man lay down his life for another.""--Rex"	soc.religion.christian

Taking this at face value (though it seems quite dissonant with   much else that has been published here about brute force DES   cracking, unless Russell was lucky with respect to the key), I'd be   very interested in whether the program Russell used is available?key search is very practical in many real situations since people usesuch stupid keys on the average.  password crackers know this well.   Depending on his answer, this could be an appalling development   calling into question both DES and RSA/DES.not really.  in fact, public key based communication systems veryoften pick keys automatically which are much better than passwords orpass phrases.   If any bright programmer with a little idle machine time can crack   a single DES message in a couple of days (assuming no tricks that   are message-specific),if a person picked the password or pass phrase, then the key search ispretty straightforward.  in running english text, the average contentof a single word is about 8 bits.  in pass phrases, this may increaseto 10 bits or so.  searching 30bit spaces is semi-practical even insoftware and searching 40bit spaces isn't outrageous to imagine withhardware assists of moderate size.	sci.crypt

Installing second IDE driveRecently my cousin got a second internal IDE drive (a Seagate 210MB,I can look up the model number if it's important) and I've beentrying to help him install it.  [I've got a vested interest, sincemy machine's busted and I have to use his until I get mine fixed.]He already has a Seagate 85MB IDE HD (again, I forget the model numberbut I can find out.)Anyway, I can't seem to get the bloody thing up.  I've managed to getone or the other drive up (with the other disconnected), but not bothat the same time; whenever I try, the thing hangs during bootup -never gets past the system test.  The IDE controller's instructionsheet says it supports two drives; I think I've configured the CMOScorrectly; the power's plugged in properly; I even learned about themaster/slave relationship that two HDs are supposed to have (didn'tknow PCs were into S&M! 8^) and I think I configured the jumpersproperly (the 85MB one is the master, the new 210MB one is the slave).The only thing I can think of is maybe I'm doing the cabling wrong.  I'vetried several combinations:controller - master - slavecontroller - slave - mastermaster - controller - slaveNone of them worked.  Unfortunately, I can't think of any others.Another possibility is that the 85MB one is already partitioned intotwo seperate drives, C and D, and the CMOS asks for ""C: drive"" and ""D:drive"" setup info rather than ""drive 1"" and ""drive 2"" like most othersI've seen.  Could this be confusing things?So, I need HELP!  The drive came bereft of any docs, except for someinfo for the CMOS setup; the controller has a little piece of paperabout the size of an index card; I cannibalized the cable (it's oneof those with a connector at each end and the one in the middle, soit looks like a serial connection); now I be lost!Many, many thanks in advance!

It just might be a bad idea for them, too.OK, suppose the NY State Police want to tap a suspect's phone.  Theyneed a warrant, just like the old days.  But unlike the old days, theynow need to    (a) get two federal agencies to give them the two parts of       the key.Now, what happens if there's a tiff between the two escrow houses?Posession/release of keys becomes a political bargaining chit.  Stateand lower-level police agencies have to watch the big boys play politics,while potentially good leads disappear, lives and property are lost,statutes of limitations run out, etc.  Not to mention: a moderatelyclever person who suspects the police are after her/him will be buyingnew phones faster than tap requests can be processed.  Or using stolenones.  [Will the Turing Police come and arrest you for transmittingwithout a dialing license?]There's also bureacracy and security problems -- within each escrow house, how will requests for key disclosure be authenticated?  Put in enoughsafeguards of the kind bureaucrats and activists feel comfortable with, and it might take a LONG time to get that key.  [Even when a request is approved, how is the key going to be disclosed?  Will it be encrypted by a Clipper-typechip for transmission?  In a bureaucracy the size of the FederalGovernment, with a databank of the necessary size, and data traffic ofthe projected volume, there's going to be a lot of weak links.  How many of these kinds of problems will be open for public or ""expert"" scrutiny?]  Furthermore, the Feds might be leery of handing completed keys around, even to State Police agencies: a trust and security issue.  This would be an especially acute issue if some other State's Police had mishandled a key, resulting in lawsuits, financial settlements, and political embarassment.  So, the Feds implement it this way:    (b) some federal agency gets the keys, performs the tap, and       turns the results over to the NY State Police.But let's say Cuomo's been causing some problems over a ClintonAid-To-Urban-Areas proposal.  Or there just happens to be a turf wargoing on between the State cops and the Justice department on a case.Now, not only do we have the keys as a political chit, we have anextra player in the game *and* we have the tap's tapes as anotherbargaining chit.  Again, the State Police lose.I understand that (legal) wiretaps are quite expensive to maintain.

As for them 'playing on a team that is not so much in need of another bigbat', I disagree here too. About the only chink in the Braves' armor is thatthey're weak offensively at several positions (CF, C, 2B, SS if Belliardplays, 1B unless Bream and Hunter form another super-platoon) and very weak defensively if Blauser plays.

Some>send data to both, some only send data to the left channel>(the first is preferrable, of course)Okay, I guess its time for a quick explanation of Mac sound.The original documentation for the sound hardware (IM-3) documents how tomake sound by directly accessing hardware.  Basically, you jam valuesinto all the even bytes from SoundBase to SoundBase+0x170. This wasbecauseof how the Mac 128 (and some later machines) generated sound was byscanningthis block and D/Aing every even byte (the odd bytes went to the floppy onsome machines).When the Mac II (and Apple Sound Chip) was invented, it was designed togenerate stereo sound. It was also designed to be compatible with we hadoncedocumented. So storing bytes at the even values at SoundBase meant ""Iwant toplay a mono sound"" and so it was emulated. But Apple had since retractedthedocumentation on SoundBase and decided not to document the lowest layersofsound generation. So apple never explained where to stuff bytes if youwantto make stereo sound.Enter game developers. The sound driver and current sound manager areinconveniently lame for making games. Furthermore, people who port fromtheIBM don't want to learn more APIs. So, it has become popular for gamewriters to write to SoundBase to make sound, since it is very easy.Since the Mac II, Apple has had many different kind of sound outputhardware,and the only things they have in common are that writing to SoundBaseworks.On some hardware, (Mac II, IIx, IIcx, IIci at least), writing to SoundBasegets you mono sound through both speakers. On some Macs (Quadra700/900/950at least) writing to SoundBase gets you mono sound on the left channelonly.Both are technically correct interpretations of the originalspecification,but one is obviously preferable for asthetic reasons.If developers use the Sound Manager (and I think the sound driver), monosounds will (typically) come out through both channels regardless of theunderlying hardware. It is possible to specify you want to generate leftchannel only, but no one does. If developers write to sound base, theirgames will only come out the left on some games.The other problem, the original Mac II only producing left channel soundon the internal speaker, while the SE/30 mixes both, isn't really related.It is due to the post generation amplification used on the motherboards ofthe different machines. It only affects true stereo sounds. Sounds whichare actually mono, will play on the internal speaker, no matter whatmachineyou have.Now, to more directly address the question, the games you list:>Lemmings>Out of This World  (awesome game, BTW)>Glider 4.0>OIDSand alsoHellcats,Super TetrisOxyd(and many more, these are just what I've tested)Cheat and write to SoundBase and so are only left channel on Quadras.Other games you list:>Armor Alley>Spectre>Spaceward Ho!and alsoPGA Tour GolfCivilization(and more, these are again only from personal experience)Use the sound manager and work fine on all machines.The more of the story is to developers: DON'T CHEAT!Really, I am absolutely, positively not allowed to do what I am about todo,but I'm going say it anyway.Stop cheating on sound!Really soon, you will be sorry, as even those without external speakerswill be disappointed with your sound on future hardware. The grace periodis about to end.The Sound Manager is understandable now, and works pretty well and willworkeven better soon, so use it.In conclusion:To Doug, it isn't a hardware problem, at least, not a bug.To Jon, it isn't a choice to developers as to whether they want to sendsoundto both channels. If they do it the right way, it is taken care ofautomatically. If you cheat, there is not way to make it work on allhardware.Have fun.Disclaimer number 1:I don't work on sound here at Apple, I'm just pretty well informed.So don't write me with sound questions.Disclaimer number 2:If it says up above that I wrote anything like ""the grace period is aboutto end"" then it is a bug in your news feed, since I am catagorically notallowed to say anything like that. You know what I mean.Disclaimer number 3:I don't speak for Apple, just me.-Steve Bollinger"	comp.sys.mac.hardware

I spoke to the pastor of my parish (Catholic) recently, by coincidence, on this subject.  His explaination was that while it is possible for a couple to marry without the presenceof a priest, it is important to have it recognized by the Church as soon as it is possible.  Because the Church recoginizes itself as a community of believers, membersof the church, to some degree, are to be held accountableto each other.  To be less hypothetical than that mythicalcouple on the desert island, there are many places in theworld that do not have priests availible for marriageson a regular basis.  Therefore, couples get married withoutthe priest being present, but get the priest to testify totheir marriage when one comes through the area.  	I remember a religion teacher in high school sayingthat the marriage ceremony is not for the benefit of the coupleas much as it is for the benefit of the community.  Thus,married couples have some responsibility to the communityto stay married, as divorce sets a bad example for thecommunity.  Also, the couple has vowed to become one withone another--the community should be able to rely on that couple to be as one.	While couples may marry without witnesses, they may NOT get anulments without a priest present.  An anulment is simply an admission of the church that whatthey had declared a marriage was not, in fact, a marriageat all, for whatever reason.  So don't start getting marriedin the back seat of a station wagon and giving yourselvesanulments a half-hour later!!	I tend to agree with the response back there thatsaid couples become married as soon as they consumate theirmarriage, but I would add that couples should consider theirmarriage consumated if they have sex, whether or not theyintended to be married, assuming they were both willingpartners to the sexual act.  The couple must be preparedto raise any children they may have as a result of thatsexual act with the benefit of both parents.  Sex IS acommitment, I believe, in God's eyes.	But I'm digressing....

During the years of World War I, the x-Soviet Armenian Government has planned and perpetrated the 'Genocide' of the Muslim people, which not only took the lives of 2.5 million Muslim people, but was also the method used to empty the Turkish homeland of its inhabitants. To this day, Turkish historic lands remain occupied by the x-Soviet Armenia. In order to cover up the fact of its usurpation of the historic Turkish homeland, which is the crux of Turkish political demands, fascist x-Soviet Armenia continues its anti-Turkish policy in the following ways:1. x-Soviet Armenia denies the historical fact of the Turkish Genocidein order to shift international public opinion away from its politicalresponsibility.2. x-Soviet Armenia, employing ASALA/SDPA/ARF Terrorism and Revisionism Triangle, attempts to call into question the veracity of the Turkish Genocide.3. x-Soviet Armenia has also implemented state-sponsored terrorism throughthe ASALA/SDPA/ARF Terrorism and Revisionism Triangle in an attempt to silence the Turkish people's vehement demands and protests.4. Using all its human, financial, and governmental resources, x-SovietArmenia and its tools in the United States attempt to silence throughterrorism, bribery and other subversive methods, non-Turkish supportersof the Turkish cause, be they political, governmental and humanitarian.Using all the aforementioned methods, the x-Soviet Armenian Government is attempting to neutralize the international diplomatic community frommaking the Turkish Case a contemporary issue.Yet despite the efforts of the x-Soviet Armenian Government and its terrorist and revisionist organizations, in the last decades, thanks to the struggle of those whose closest ones have been systematically exterminated by the Armenians, the international wall of silence on this issue has begun to collapse, and consequently a number of governments and organizations have become supportive of the recognition of the Turkish Genocide.With the full knowledge that the struggle for the Turkish territorialdemands are still in their initial stages, the Turkish and Kurdish peoplewill unflaggingly continue in this sacred struggle, therefore the victimsof the Turkish Genocide demand:1. that the x-Soviet Armenian Government, as the heirs of the Armenian Dictatorship, recognize the Turkish Genocide;2. that x-Soviet Armenia return the historic homeland to the Turkish andKurdish people;3. that the x-Soviet Armenian Government make material reparations for their heinous and unspeakable crime to the victims of the Turkish Genocide;4. that all world governments, and especially the United States, officiallyrecognize the Turkish Genocide and Turkish territorial rights and refuseto succumb to all Armenian political pressure;5. that the U.S. Government free itself from the friendly position it has adopted towards its unreliable ally, x-Soviet Armenia, and officially recognize the historical fact of the Turkish Genocide as well as be supportive of the pursuit of Turkish territorial demands;6. that the x-Soviet Republics officially recognize the historical fact of the Turkish Genocide and include the cold-blooded extermination of 2.5 million Muslim people in their history books.Serdar Argic                           'We closed the roads and mountain passes that                             might serve as ways of escape for the Turks                             and then proceeded in the work of extermination.'

I am, however,  a devoted Quicken user, and I can tell youhow to set up the weekly, monthly, quarterly, yearly transactions.  Firstuse the Memorize feature (CTRL-M) to record the recurring transactions. Next, define a transaction group which uses these memorized transactionsand specify the frequency that it should be used (i.e. monthly).  Quickenwill/can not automatically make the transactions for you, but now all youdo is recall the group and all of the individual transactions will beentered at once.  Additionally if you are using the Bill Minder, it willremind you when each transaction group is due.  For example, you could havethree transaction groups.  One for payments at the beginning of the month,middle of the month, and one for quarterly payments.  I hope this helps.Mike	comp.os.ms-windows.misc

It is what you feel if you are overwhelmed by a feelingof comfort, such as seeing or thinking about something beautiful.     Another thing.  When you sleep, you lie down facing up, with yourpalms aside of you and facing down on the surface of the bed.  Then yourelax, and there start involuntary nerve firings inside your flesh.

[...]B >  Marty B. Marty, I personally wouldn't be so quick and take that NEJM article  on kidney stones as gospel. First of all, I would want to know who sponsored that study. I have seen too many ""nutrition"" bulletins over the years from local newspapers, magazines, to TV-guide, with disclaimers on the bottom informing us that this great health news was brought to us compliments of the Dairy Industries. There are of course numerous other interest groups now that thrive financially on the media hype created from the supposedly enormous  benefits of increasing one's calcium intake. Secondly, were ALL the kidney stones of the test subjects involved  in that project analysed for their chemical composition?  The study didn't say that, it only claimed that ""most kidney stones are large- ly calcium."" Perhaps it won't be long before another study comes up with the exact opposite findings. A curious phenomenon with researchers is that they are oftentimes just plain wrong. It wouldn't be the first time.  Sodium/magnesium/calcium/phosphorus ratios are, in my opinion, still  the most reliable indicators for the cause, treatment, and prevention  of kidney stones. I, for one, will continue to recommend the most logical changes in one's diet or through supplementation to counteract or prevent kidney stones of either type; and they definitely won't include an INCREASE in calcium if the stones have been identified as being of the calcium type and people's chemical analysis confirms that they would benefit from a PHOSPHORUS-raising approach instead!

Which leads to below:>and he was as poor a coach as you claim- he would have been intelligent>enough to hire the coach to push the team to the next level of success.I think at this point there's a personal, emotional element involved herewhich transcends Murray's logical thought.  As outsiders, it's fine for us to say, ""He should hire a different coach.""  In fact, he has talked aboutdoing so in the past.  But, the press (here in Detroit, at least) has sobuilt up this business about Murray never getting past the second round ofthe playoffs as a coach, that I think he has taken it upon himself to prove to the world that he *is* capable of coaching a team past the secondround.  He needs to, as the papers say, ""get that monkey off his back.""So it becomes a matter not of intelligence, but of pride.  Is it foolishto let pride stand in the way of sound logic?  Perhaps, but we're alla little that way from time to time.  I think eventually he'll step downfrom behind the bench and concentrate on his GM duties, and the team willimprove as a result.I think his coaching duties take away time he might have otherwise spenton GM work.  In that sense, once he steps down as coach, we'll see howgood of a GM he really is.>But Murray is an average (unspectacular) NHL coach and a pretty good GM>so none of this is true anyway.I may not agree with everything you've said, but it's been fun discussingit with you.>Gregmeister--Randy"	rec.sport.hockey

On-ice, the Leafs won the Atlantic Division title butoff ice was less happy. A strike by public workers has forced theleafs out of the Newfoundland city for much of the last half ofthe seaosn (since mid-Jan). They have played ""home"" games in placeslike Montreal, Cornwall and Charlottetown. Their playoff ""home""games will be played in the Metro Center in Halifax, NS. Onedemostration got violent. Workers attacked a Leafs' bus androcked it and broke windows in the St John's Memorial Stadium.Despite the problems, Toronto officials insist that the Leafswill return to St John's once the strike ends.===================================================SENATORS SOLDThe New Haven Senators have been sold by Peter Shipman tothe Ottawa Senators NHL organization. They are the only CanadianNHL team with an American AHL affiliate, and have made it clearthey intend to move the team to somewhere in the Canadian AtlanticProvinces. This sale and move has yet to be approved by the AHLhead office, but is expected to pass easily at the general meetingin May. The quote in the story from Jack Butterfield made it clear the league was more interested in the stability of the AHL franchise accompanied by NHL ownership, rather than maintainingthe 56-year history of the AHL in New Haven. The Senators are currently in serious negotiations with CharlottetownNew Brunswick and are expected to move there.==================================================DALLAS HELPS HAWKS STAY IN MONCTONAfter announcing that they would pull their affiliation outof Moncton, the Winnipeg Jets changed their mind. The Jets announced the move when they said that they would be slashingtheir minor league roster from 20-something to around a dozen; and theywanted to share with an existing AHL or IHL franchise.Enter the Dallas Lone Stars. Dallas agreed to supply the remaining6 or 8 players to the Moncton franchise. Thus keeping the Hawksin the New Brunswick city.The deal is for one year and will be extended to three years ifthe season ticket base increases to over 3000. The Hawks only sold1400 for this year.============================================================SAINT JOHN FLAMES OFFICIALThe Calgary Flames have officially signed a deal with the city ofSaint John, NB. The Saint John Blue Flames will play in the 6200Exhibition Center. The Flames still have to apply for an expansionfrnachise from the AHL but are expected to have no trouble.=========================================================CAPS FOLLOW JACKS TO MAINEDespite rumors to the contrary, the Capitals will follow the BaltimoreSkipjacks to Maine. The Caps' current farm team, the Baltimore Skipjacks,announced that they would move to Maine and become the Portland Pirates.There was much doubt as to if the Caps would follow but they announceda limited deal with Portland. They would supply a dozen or so playersincluding 2 goalies. They become the third team to announce a limitedfarm team along with Moncton and the Capital District Islanders.======================================================AHL GAME OF THE WEEKIn early January, the AHL started a game of the week. The game, producedby, I believe, Pyman Productions, was televised across the CanadianMaritimes and northeastern US. The first few weeks saw two games ofthe week, one in Canada and another in the US but since then, therehas been only one. Sunday afternoon and night games were covered andshown on Sportschannel NY and NE in the US and, I believe, AtlanticSports Network in Canada (but I'm not sure about that). I am notsure if playoff games will be covered.=====================================================UTICA GONE? SYRACUSE ADDED?There were heavy rumors that the Utica Devils will not be around nextseason. There were rumors that they might be headed to a midwesterncity and that the city of Syracuse is trying to lure them.=====================================================WHAT THE AHL MIGHT LOOK LIKE NEXT YEARONE OPTION				ANOTHER OPTION			Northern Division			Southern DivisionADIRONDACK RED WINGS			ADIRONDACKSPRINGFIELD INDIANS			SPRINGFIELDPROVIDENCE BRUINS			PROVIDENCECD ISLANDERS				CDIPORTLAND PIRATES			HERSHEY					BINGHAMTONSouthern Division			ROCHESTERHERSHEY BEARS				HAMILTONBINGHAMTON RANGERS			UTICAROCHESTER AMERICANSHAMILTON CANUCKS			Atlantic DivisionUTICA (?)

"Newsgroup:comp.windows.xdocument_id: 67991From: jc@minya.UUCP (John Chambers)Subject: painting with increasing resolutionSome  people working a few cubes over have come up with this need, andit seems that someone out there just might have done it  already,  andcan point me to some tools that would help. What they'd like to do is:Given a window that is taking a long time to draw (because either  thedata  is  arriving  over a slow link, or the $DISPLAY is across a slowlink), they would like to first paint a low-resolution version of  thepicture,  and then repaint it in higher resolution.  Thus, the picturemight first be generated in 1/4 resolution, with each  4x4  square  ofpixels  being  filled  in  with a single color.  Next, each 4x4 squarewould be replaced by 4 2x2 squares; finally the 1x1 version  would  bepainted.Since  one of the scenarios is with the window being on the other sideof a slow link, the low-res version obviously wouldn't be  transmittedas  a bitmap; that wouldn't help at all.  Instead, there would have tobe a process on the far end that receives the  low-res  picture  as  asmall  bitmap,  and  blows up each pixel into a square (sorta like themagnifier programs do).  This brings up the question of whether the  Xserver  can help.  That is, when a window is opened, is there a way toask that a ""filter"" program be run to process the pixels?  Or  is  theonly  way  to  use  something  like  rsh  to start up a remote process(""Permission denied"" ;-), and have it open a local window?It seems the most likely scenario is a library routine that starts  upsuch  a  program  remotely, and then accepts bitmaps, compressing eachone by some amount, and sending them to the remote program to  expand.But  if  there is something that X itself can do to help, it's be niceto hear about it.  (I looked in several FMs,  but  if  it's  there,  Iobviously  don't  know  the keywords ;-).  If someone has a nifty toolavailable that packages it all, we might want to get a copy.Oh, yes; this is to run on some Suns.  Part of the idea  is  to  builddemos  that  can  show such things as ""If this were run across, say, a4800-bps link, this is how fast the pictures would appear.""  Then  thecustomer would get a feel for the speed that they need to pay for.-- If the auto industry were like the computer industry, a car would  nowcost $5, would get 5000 miles to the gallon, and at random times wouldexplode, killing all its passengers."	comp.windows.x

Hunt)Subject: LOVE in the morning: by Malcolm Smith Ministries----- Begin Included Message -----The following teaching is brought to you on behalf of Malcolm SmithMinistries, a ministry dedicated to leading believers everywhere into aknowledge of the love of God.  If you would like more info on the ministry,and/or would like to comment on whether you found this teaching beneficial,e-mail to Randy Hunt at rlhunt@hou.amoco.com.LOVE IN THE MORNING  (Psalm 90:14)by Malcolm SmithMoses wrote this prayer at a weary time in the history of Israel. A generationbefore the time of its writing, the people of Israel had stood at Kadesh,gateway to Canaan, and made the fateful choice to go their own way ratherthan God's way. They refused an adventure of faith in God which wouldhave given them Canaan, the homeland of promise. God honored theirdecision, and said they would wander in the desert only a few miles from theland of promise until they were all buried in the sand. The young decision-makers of that fateful day were between twenty and thirty years old, anddestined to be dead within forty years... bleached bones in the desert by thetime they were seventy-- eighty, at the most. The lives of these wanderershad been unending sadness. Moses described it as ending each year with asigh (v. 9). The fact that they knew, give or take a few months, when theywere going to die, underscored the meaninglessness of their existence.Whatever heights of success they reached, they would be a heap of bleachedbones within forty years.  The only ones to live outside of that depression ofhopeless disbelief were Joshua and Caleb, who had stood against the nationat Kadesh and had God' s promise of one day entering the land. Theforty-year period was finally drawing to an end. The new generation, thosewho were children at Kadesh, were now grown and eager to take theinheritance their parents had refused to enjoy. In the light of this, Mosesprays...it is time for a new day to begin and the days of misery to be over.All these years, as Moses had walked with these moaning and complainingpeople through the wilderness of their exile, he had carried a double burden.His was not only the sadness of living in less than what could have been; buthe also knew why they had chosen as they had at Kadesh.  The problem wasthat they were ignorant of the character of their God. If asked. ""Who is yourGod?"" they would have described Him as the God who is Power. WhenAaron had created their concept of God in an idol. he chose a calf. or youngbull--a symbol of power, of virility. In their minds, God was the young bullwho had impaled Pharaoh on his horns and gored Egypt's gods as He ledIsrael to Sinai.  But when man worships a God of power, His miracles growthin and even boring. After miracle food on the desert floor and watergushing miraculously from the solid rock through the desert wasteland, theGod of Almightiness becomes ""ho-hum --What' s next on the miracle menu?""And a God of power can be as unpredictable as a young bull calf. He mightbe all they need, but then...who knows? If He has all power, He has a rightto do whatever He wants, whenever He wants. The only person these peoplehad known who had absolute power was Pharaoh, and men's lives had hungon the whim of his moods, which could change with the wind. They believedGod could work His wonders on their behalf, but they did not know HIMand, so, could not trust Him. Israel had a God based on what He DID, Hisacts; Moses knew the heart of God, the motivation behind the acts. From theday of his encounter at the burning bush, Moses had been fascinated by God.At Sinai, he asked to be shown His glory...to know who He really was. Hehad seen what God had done; he wanted to know who God was. Thisrequest was granted, and Moses was given a glimpse of God's gloriousPerson. He had come to know the heart of God as compassion andlovingkindness (Exodus 34:6,7). The word ""lovingkindness"" is not to beunderstood as a human kind of love. It speaks of the kind of relationshiparising out of the making of a covenant. It can only be understood as thelove that says, ""I will never leave you nor forsake you."" Lovingkindness is astenacious as a British bulldog; when the world walks out, this love digs in itsheels and refuses to leave.And it is not human romantic love, based onfeelings and rooted in emotions. It is a love of covenant commitment and,therefore, operates quite apart from feelings. God's love is not an emotionthat wavers day by day; it is the total commitment of His Being to seek ourhighest and best, and to bring us to our fullest potential as humans. Goddoes not see something good and beautiful in us which arouses His feelingsof love toward us...we do not woo Him and cause Him to fall in love withus! If that were the case, the first ugly, sinful thing we did would cause Himto reject us.  He is Love, and He loves us because of who He is-- notbecause of who we are. He does not love what we do, but He is committedto us, pursuing us down every blind alley and bypath of foolishness. He willnot let us go. His is a love that is not looking for what it can get out of us--but a committed love that searches for opportunities to give to us. It issaying to the recipient, ""For as long as we shall live, I am for you.""  The Godwho has revealed Himself to man through Scripture and, finally, in Jesus--inHis coming, and in His death and resurrection--is the God who islovingkindness. Thus He loves us and gives Himself to us...He will neverleave us nor forsake us.  Tragically, many believers have never seen Him aslove; they see Him as power. No one will come to faith by just seeingmiracles. Miracles point to who He is, and that is when faith springs in theheart.  Israel did not see God as lovingkindness; they saw His acts of power.Moses knew His ways, the kind of God He was, and the love that He had forthese people. Because of their total lack of understanding of His love, theycould not trust Him to be their strength in taking the land. Faith is born outof knowing the love He has for us; it is the resting response to the One whogives Himself to us. He is not the force, and to call Him the Almighty is tomiss His heart. He is Love who is the Almighty and the Infinite Force.  Ifman is to make force or raw power work for him, he must depend onknowing the forrnula and have faith in it. But the power that issues fromlove demands faith in the Person of love Himself. The forty years ofmeaningless wandering was a monument to a people who had never come toknow the God of love.  At this point, with the new generation and thepossibility of enjoying all that God promised, Moses prays verse 14. Thelanguage Moses uses is reminiscent of a baby having slept secure in itsmother's love, now waking to look up into the delight of her eyes. It iswaking to the consciousness of being loved... watched over, cared for,protected, fed, and cleaned, day and night, by the mother. Suppose we wereto ask, ""What has the baby done to deserve this?"" or, ""Have arrangementsbeen made for the child to repay the parents for this inconvenience?"" Ourquestions would be considered unnatural, even immoral. The child wasconceived in love, anticipated and prepared for with love's excitement, a lovethat has been to the gates of death to bring it into being. The parents' love isunconditional, spontaneous...it has nothing to do with the looks of the childor its performance. So God is love. He loves us unconditionally,spontaneously. We were conceived in His imagination and fashioned afterHis image, to be brought to where we are at this moment by the blood of theLord Jesus. It is slanderous, and immoral, to even ask what we must do toearn and deserve that love. The child discovers its personhood and identitythrough the eyes and touch, through the cuddles, of its parents' love. It is ascientific fact that a baby who is not touched and held will probably die or, ifit survives, will have severe emotional problems. And a person who has beenheld and loved will still never know the true meaning of life without theembrace and knowledge of love from God. Moses prays that the newgeneration will learn to wake every morning, resting with total confidence inthe love of God. and will receive all His promises and blessings with joy andgladness. Significantly, Moses prays that they will be SATISFIED with Hislove. ""Satisfied."" in the Hebrew language. is a rich picture word describingbeing filled with an abundance of gourmet food. It is also used to describethe earth after the rain has soaked it and all the vegetation has receivedenough water. Moses prays that they will awaken every morning to bedrenched in the life-giving love of God. That sense of satisfaction is thelifelong quest of every man and woman. When we are satisfied in ourdeepest selves, many of our emotional--and even our physical--problemsdisappear. Man seeks that sense of satisfaction which comes from feelingthat he is fulfilled as a human being...his hours have meaning, which makesense out of the ordinary and mundane. Apart from God, man seeks thissatisfaction through intellectual pursuit, through the exciting of theemotions, and through the feeding of his body...he will even seek it inreligious exercise. But man will always be dissatisfied until he is respondingto the love of the living God. Only in knowing God's love will the rest of lifemake sense. As the forty years drew to a close and the land of promise againbecame the inheritance to be taken, Moses prayed this psalm. I find itfascinating that he  should pray and ask God for a daily revelation of Hislove. Considering the awe with which the people held Moses. one wouldthink he could have lectured them on the subject of lovingkindness and, bythe knowledge they gained, they would live in it. But Moses knewbetter. God is the only one who can make known to us His love. We won'tfind it in a religious lecture or a formula which we can learn and use tomanipulate Him. Nor is it in a beautiful poem to titillate our emotions andgive us God feelings. It is God, himself, the Lover, who must open our eyesand satisfy us with His love. This prayer is man, in helplessness, asking Godto make the love He is real in our hearts. Moses' prayer was partiallyanswered in the next generation and seen in the exploits of faith whichworked by love in The Book of Judges. But it would not be answered in itsfullest dimensions until the coming of the Holy Spirit, who pours out thelove of God in our hearts (Romans 5:5). In the history of the early Church,we read of the Holy Spirit ""falling upon"" the believers. This is an ancientexpression that, in modern English, means to give a bear hug. It is used inLuke 15 to describe the father running to the prodigal and ""falling on hisneck and kissing him."" The Holy Spirit is God hugging you in your deepestself and smothering you with divine kisses at the deepest level of yourbeing. This is not a one-time experience to be filed in our spiritual resumes.Moses prayed that morning by morning we would awaken to the realizationthat we are loved. The world, and much of our religious training, has taughtus to perform in order to be accepted. We have spent far too long living in astate of doing in order to find satisfaction for ourselves...to find acceptanceand love from others, and from God. We now come humbled to receive lovewe cannot earn...to be still and let Him tell us we are loved: to let the HolySpirit descend into us, pouring out the love of God. We come in stillness tothink on and repeat His words of love to our minds. which have been jadedwith the doctrine of ""perform to be accepted."" We begin to realize that Heloves us as we are, and gives meaning and purpose to all of life. I challengeeveryone reading this to begin each day, from the moment you open youreyes, by celebrating the God of love and praying this prayer. You may notfeel anything, but SOMETHING ALWAYS HAPPENS. I was X-rayed theother day. I did not see or feel anything, but I noted that the technicians keptbehind protective walls. They know you cannot be exposed to those rayswithout being affected. So it is as we consciously begin our day knowingthat we are loved. Such experiential knowledge will produce, according toMoses, ""joy and gladness all our days."" Joy is the result of a life that isfunctioning as God intended us to function when He made us. You might saythat joy is the hum of an engine that is at peak performance. Man' s highestperformance is to rest in the love God has for him... the hum will be joy, andthe result will be endless creativity arising from the sense of meaning he nowhas in life. Stop wandering in the wilderness. Be satisfied with His love and,in joy, day by day, receive all His promised blessings.----- End Included Message -----"	soc.religion.christian

If you can taste the difference, psychological reaction might play a role.The fact is, MSG is part of natural substance. Everyone, I mean EVERYONE,consumes certain amount of MSG every day through regular diet withoutthe synthesized MSG additive.Chinese, and many other Asians (Japanese, Koreans, etc) have usedMSG as flavor enhancer for two thousand years. Do you believe thatthey knew how to make MSG from chemical processes? Not. They justextracted it from natural food such sea food and meat broth.Baring MSG is just like baring sugar which many people react to.Jason Chen"	sci.med

She's no artist, so she intends touse comercial clipart and customise it a bit by drawing a circle or a boxaround it etc.  We have MSPublisher for manipulating text, but it is not suitable for doingmuch with graphics, so she needs a more specialised tool. Right now she'slooking at Corel Draw and Harvard Draw. There seem to be more books in thestores on Corel than on Harvard, so she's inclined to go with Corel on thebasis of popularity. Can anyone give us an informed opinion on which package would be more suitable or if there is an even better alternativeavailable? If this is a FAQ, please withhold the flames and just send thelocation of the FAQ document. Thanks. Three PS's: 1) Is it ok to use clip art from Harvard Draw or whatever for commercial   purposes? 2) We have a 600 dpi Laser Jet 4 printer.

Asher                                          Yes, Xhibition is for the X Window System.  The X Window System Conference remains the largest and most complete conference devoted to X.  Nineteen fulland half day tutorials and thirty-six technical sessions over three daysprovide huge amounts of information for X application developers.  Add vendorexhibits and a Product Presentation track to provide information on whatfolks can purchase today, and you have a complete show focused on X11.Speakers at Xhibition 93 include:   Bob Schiefler, Lu Abel, Mark Ackerman, Paul Asente, Doug Blewett,   Donna Converse, Jim Fulton, Oliver Jones, Keith Packard, Ralph Swick,   Doug Young, and many others.Xhibition is growing (fortunately for us:-) and we have added some additionalconferences.  Surveys that we have given have indicated additional topics ofinterest.  These include: object oriented technologies such as the ObjectManagement Group's ORB and CORBA; C++ as it applies to X; client servertechnologies such as DCE; threads; databases- object oriented and relational;and (not surprisingly when you look at the audience) Windows NT.With the bulk of the Xhibition audience (and the UNIX community) developingapplications for in-house or custom use, a new 32-bit operating system from aplayer as large as Microsoft needs to be evaluated. With MS Windows on so manydesktops, and the price of computing power dropping, its successor needs to beevaluated.  As corporations begin to look at NT, so must their developers andsuppliers.The mission of the Xhibition technical conferences is to provide informationto the application developer and to the technology planner.  The NT Conferenceat Xhibition is designed to do just that.  We worked with Microsoft to providethe *only* conference this year specifically designed to show X and UNIXdevelopers the capabilities of Windows and NT.  If you aren't sure that NT haswhat you need for your application development or systems deployment, this isthe place to find out.  Ask the folks from Microsoft, get them to show youwhat you need.  Conference attendees will receive NT Software DevelopmentKits- to bang on, evaluate, and generally to see for yourself.I hope this doesn't sound like an NT commercial (it should sound like anXhibition commercial:-).  I just want to reiterate that the Xhibition audienceis growing and Xhibition is growing along with it.  The industry is aconfusing place at the moment with UNIX, COSE, NT, DCE, CORBA, and all ofthe other acronyms sprouting up.

"Newsgroup:rec.sport.baseballdocument_id: 102713From: drw3l@delmarva.evsc.Virginia.EDU (David Robert Walker)Subject: Re: Young CatchersMost of this discussion has been between Mark Singer and David Tate,with Valentine weighing in on the same side as Dave at various times.My opinion, FWIW, to all:Mark, age doesn't matter; ability does. I would rather have the untriedrookie with great minor league numbers than the veteran who has provenhimself to be average at best. I don't care if he is 15; if he playsbetter than what I have, I want him out there. Sandy Alomar had decentminor league numbers, grossly inflated by the PCL in general and LasVegas in particular; he should have been projected as an average majorleague hitter (which is good for a catcher, I'll admit). Santiago'snumbers would probably come out the same as Sandy's, but I don't havethe league data from the mid-80s to check it out.That being said, I agree with sending Lopez to Richmond, at least tostart the season. As the box below shows, he has *one* minor leagueseason in which he hit well. He has two in which he hit very, verypoorly. I want to see that the 92 Lopez is real. Olson and Berryhillare not complete mediocrities; for catchers, especially NL catchers,they are essentially average hitters, with equivalent averages around.220. If he had hit well at prior levels, I would say he belongs onthe Braves; but there is a reasonable chance that Lopez last year wasjust as much a fluke as Alomar in 90 or Santiago in 87. One year atany level, at any age, doesn't satisfy MY standards of evidence.

Granted, I thought his behavior withMcCarver last year was completely bush. Last year was the first timehe ever got 300 AB in one place, so his lines are hard to read. But hehas a combined 720 OPS in minor league play; with his speed is morevaluable than the OPS alone indicates; and at a still young age (24),had a monster year with an 868 OPS. He has a total, major and minor,EQA of .249; above major league average, and above average for CF(which was about .240 in the NL last year). He has shown at least thepotential of going into the .290s, which would make him one of the 15best hitters in the league. He has two full seasons before reachinghis ""prime"" season of 27. He should be considered as a legitimateprospect, and not as a simple side-show attraction.

"Newsgroup:sci.electronicsDocument_id: 52806From: paj@uk.co.gec-mrc (Paul Johnson)Subject: Peltier Effect Heat PumpsI was having a look through a couple of components catalogues when Icame across a range of Peltier Effect heat pumps intended for coolingcomponents.  For those who have not heard of this effect, you put acurrent through one of these devices, and it pumps heat from one sideto the other.  Reverse the current and you reverse the effect.  Ithink a temperature difference can give you an EMF as well.Anyway, it struck me that you could make a nice cool/hot box forpicnics with one of these, a power regulator, a thermostat and acouple of heat sinks.  The biggest device can shift 60W with anefficiency of 80-90%, which ain't bad (although it would flatten mycar battery in about half an hour).Unfortunately the catalogue didn't list anything more than the basicspecs as a heat pump.  I imagine that you would get a back-EMF as thetemperature gradient across the device increases.  If so, presumablyits power decreases as the back-EMF increases, until eventually wehave a steady state with no current being consumed (assuming noleakage).  If so, then the final temperature difference between thetwo sides could be set by the supply voltage and nothing more(although that would be a lousy way to control it).What I would like to know is:1: Are the above guesses correct?2: What is the open-circuit thermal resistance of a typical device?   (I just want to be sure that my coolbox is not going to get warm   too fast when I unplug it)3: How does a Peltier Effect heat pump actually work?  It looks like   magic!4: Why don't they use these things in domestic fridges/freezers?Thanks in advance,Paul.Paul Johnson (paj@gec-mrc.co.uk).	    | Tel: +44 245 73331 ext 3245--------------------------------------------+----------------------------------These ideas and others like them can be had | GEC-Marconi Research is notfor $0.02 each from any reputable idealist. | responsible for my opinions"	sci.electronics

A few sites offer direct dialup access or remote login access, while the    remainder support some form of file transfer. Many sites are listed as    providing 'anonymous FTP'. This refers to the File Transfer Protocol on    the Internet. Sites not connected to the Internet cannot use FTP    directly, but there are a few automated FTP servers which operates via    email. Send mail containing only the word HELP to ftpmail@decwrl.dec.com    or bitftp@pucc.princeton.edu, and the servers will send you instructions    on how to make requests.    The sources with the broadest selection of material are the NASA Ames    SPACE archive and the National Space Science Data Center.    Don't even ask for images to be posted to the net. The data volume is    huge and nobody wants to spend the time on it.VIEWING IMAGES    The possible combinations of image formats and machines is forebodingly    large, and I won't attempt to cover common formats (GIF, etc.) here. To    read PDS and VICAR (and many other) formats on Unix systems running X,    use XV 2.11, available by anonymous FTP from export.lcs.mit.edu    (18.24.0.12) in contrib/xv-2.11.tar.Z and the other standard X11 FTP    sites.    The FAQ for the Usenet group alt.binaries.pictures discusses image    formats and how to get image viewing software.

These archives include many images and    a wide variety of documents including this FAQ list, NASA press    releases, shuttle launch advisories, and mission status reports. Please    note that these are NOT maintained on an official basis.    FTP users should connect to ames.arc.nasa.gov (128.102.18.3) and look in    pub/SPACE. pub/SPACE/Index contains a listing of files available in the    archive (the index is about 200K by itself).    To access the archives by email, send a letter to    archive-server@ames.arc.nasa.gov (or ames!archive-server). In the    subject of your letter (or in the body), use commands like:	send SPACE Index	send SPACE SHUTTLE/ss01.23.91.    The capitalization of the subdirectory names is important. All are in    caps. Only text files are handled by the email server at present; use    one of the FTP email servers described in the introduction to this    section for images or programs.    The Magellan Venus and Voyager Jupiter, Saturn, and Uranus CD-ROM image    disks have been put online in the CDROM and CDROM2 directories. The    disks will be rotated on a weekly basis. Thousands of images are    available in these collections.    The GIF directory contains images in GIF format. The VICAR directory    contains Magellan images in VICAR format (these are also available in    the GIF directory). A PC program capable of displaying these files is    found in the IMDISP directory (see the item ""VIEWING IMAGES"" below).    The NASA media guide describes the various NASA centers and how to    contact their public affairs officers; this may be useful when pursuing    specific information. It's in MISC/media.guide.

NASA ASTROPHYSICS DATA SYSTEM    The ADS is a distributed data retrieval system which is easy to use and    provides uniform access to ground-based and space-based astronomy data    from NASA data centers across the country. It currently has over 140    data catalogs of radio, infrared, optical, UV, and X-ray data which can    be queried by position or any other parameter in the catalog. The ADS    also provides tools to manipulate and plot tabular results. In addition,    ADS has a Beta version of an Abstracts Service which allows users to    query over 125,000 abstracts of astronomy papers since 1975 by authors,    keywords, title words, or abstract text words.    ADS use requires direct Internet access. For more info and to sign up to    become a user, email ads@cuads.coloradu.edu.

The catalogue contains 1292 entries which represent    all known comets through November 1989 and is 96 pages long.    Non-subscribers to the Circulars may purchase the catalogue for $15.00    while the cost to subscribers is $7.50. The basic catalogue in ASCII    along with a program to extract specific orbits and calculate    ephemerides is available on MS-DOS 5.25-inch 2S2D diskette at a cost of    $75.00 (the program requires an 8087 math coprocessor). The catalogue    alone is also available by e-mail for $37.50 or on magnetic tape for    $300.00.    Except for the printed version of the catalogue, the various magnetic    media or e-mail forms of the catalogue do not specifically meantion    non-subscribers. It is possible that these forms of the catalogue may    not be available to non-subscribers or that their prices may be more    expensive than those given.

Newsgroup:talk.politics.miscDocument_id: 178418From: alaramor@magnus.acs.ohio-state.edu (Aaron C Laramore)Subject: Re: race and violenceJoe,     As usual, this issue of dysfunction, of bad values, of messed up culture is easily embraced by non african americans when it comes to explainingproblems in our community. From your post, you apparently find the idea thatsomething is wrong with African Americans, value-wise, culture wise orsomething, very appealing. I never cease to be amazed at how eager non africanamericans are to embrace theories about our problems which basically assertthat something is wrong with us. The socio-economic factors which we know help to produce high crime levels, like poverty, which exists among us in large proportion, I mean when it comes to discussion of african american problems, wesomehow become exempt from all these types of factors, and the problem is laid at the doorstep of some neboulous dysfunction we supposedly have. But nobody attributes crime amongst white americans to dysfunction. No, that has socioeconomic factors to it, but for africa americans, its gotta be a dysfunction.Basically, I think this tendency for non african americans to believe thatsomething is wrong with us exists because non african americans don't want todeal with the possiblility that the society is deeply biased against africanamericans, and that this is about 80% of the problem. It could not possible bethat the society is so deeply racist and structured against us, that this hasa very effective negative effect on us. No, something is wrong with us.Non african americans are quick to disregard what we have to say, because they are so busy trying to find something wrong with us, instead of taking a good hard look at the thing we say are doing us damage. I would get angry if it werent' so damn typical.Peace - Aaron	talk.politics.misc
