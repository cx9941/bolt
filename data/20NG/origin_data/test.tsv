Luckilythe current email carriers are less picky about what goes over theirnetworks :-).In case people think email scanning doesn't take place, I can assure youthat it is done regularly by many sites - usually not by governmentagencies (or at least not that I know of), but by local administrators who,for reasons of their own, have decided to monitor all communications(I'm sure you can all think of a whole mess of reasons - stop hackers/terrorists/child pornographers/drug dealers/evil commies/whatever).

I'm not arguing about who is the better goaltender.  I'dtake Soderstrom right now.  What I am saying is that Roussel can be a #1netminder.  The GAA difference is less than half a goal per game (less thanthat after last night), their save percentages are close, and their recordsare similar.  And with that, I just don't see how you can label Roussel asthe most disappointing player on the Flyers this season.You say Soderstrom played against better competition.  That may very wellbe, but there is no way of knowing how Roussel would have performed inthose games.  Besides, against the better scoring teams like Pittsburgh,the defense is more keyed up than they are against San Jose.> The same> for Roussel in the Ranger game. Two real scoring chances, one he made a> great play, the other he was saved by a mistake from the other player. If> you were judging Roussel on that game alone, you have very little to go by.But I'm not just judging Roussel on that game alone.  I've seen him playfor the past two seasons in Philly and before that in Hershey.  It's justmy opinion, but I think he's got what it takes.  Of course, I thought thatabout Mark LaForest, too.  But I never did about Wendell Young.  So I'mbatting .500 in judging Hershey talent since the Hextall-era.As for the Rangers game, you can say he was saved by a mistake by theoffensive player if you like.  But Rou had his leg in position to make thesave.  If he didn't, it wouldn't have mattered if the Rangers player didn'tget the puck up or not.  It would have been a goal.  On a breakaway that'swhat the goalie wants to do, take away as much as possible and force theshooter to beat him.> But if you were to look at the 0-0 tie against the Habs, you saw a goalie> stand on his head to get that shutout. THAT was a #1 goalie in action.

And not to take anything away from Soderstrom because he wassenational in that game agains the Habs.  But you can't tell me that aMontreal player had an open net to shoot at some point during that gameand just flat out missed it.  Mistakes, both on offense and defense arepart of the game.  Or there'd never be shutouts.Anyway, I'm happy the Flyers have both Soderstrom and Roussel andI'm not going to argue about it anymore.  Besides, with the current7-game winning streak and expectations soaring for next year, Idon't want to piss you off to the point that you don't sell me anytickets next season:-).                                         \ \Joe Dakes                                 \/\AT&T Microelectronics                      \/\555 Union Boulevard                         \ \Allentown, PA  18103                     LET'S GO FLYERS! alux1!jmd                                     \ \jmd@aluxpo.att.com                             \ \__________                                                \____/_//__/	rec.sport.hockey

Iguess I have some REAL ethical problems with the practices at thischurch.  I understand that Baptism is an overriding factor.  I alsounderstand that this is not an honest way to proceed.  Unfortunately,this is becoming more typical of congregations as the Second Coming isperceived to approach.There is a real element of disparation in this 'make it happen at anycost' style of theology.  I wonder where TRUST IN THE LORD fits intothis equation?Baptisms draw parents' ire -- Children at church carnival in Springstold they'd be killed by bee stings if they didn't submit to religiousrite.By Dick Foster -- Rocky Mountain News Southern BureauColorado Springs -- Outraged parents say their children were lured toa church carnival and then baptixed without their permission by aBaptist minister.Doxens of children, some as young as 8 years old and unaccompanied bytheir parents, thought they were going to a carnival at theCornerstone Baptist Church, where there would be a big water fight,free balloons, squirt guns and candy.Before that May 1 carnival was over, however, children were whiskedinto a room for religious instruction and told they should bebaptized.  In many cases they consented, although they or theirfamilies are not of the Baptist faith.The baptisms by the church have angered many parents, includingPaulette Lamontagne, a Methodist and mother of twin 8-year-old girlswho were baptized without her knowledge or consent.'My understnading was they were going to a carnival.  I feel that's afalse pretense,' said Lamontagne.  Her daughters said the ministertold them they would be killed by bee stings if they were notbaptized.Cornerstone church officials defended their actions.'We take our instructions from the word of God and God has commandedus to baptize converts.  No one can show me one passage in the Biblewhere it says that parental permission is required before a child isbaptized,' said Dan Irwin, associate pastor of the Cornerstone BaptistChurch.Church officials did not tell parents their children would be baptizedbecause 'they didn't ask,' Irwin said.Many other parents also felt they were simply sending their childrento a carnival at the invitation of their children's friends who weremembers of the Cornerstone Church.Police said chhurch officials had broken on laws in baptizing thechildren, but indicated the parents could pursue civil action.-------------------------------------------Aren't these the same behaviors we condemnin the Hari Krishnas and other cults?[I think the issues are more complex than the newspaper accountmentions.  First, I'm not entirely sure that parental consent isabsolutely required.  This would be extremely difficult, because ofthe clear commandment to obey parents.  But if an older child insistedon being baptized without their parents' consent, I might be willingto do it.  However this would be a serious step, and would warrantmuch careful discussion.  The problem I find here is not so muchparental consent as that there was nobody's consent.  Whether youbelieve in infant baptism or not, baptism is supposed to be the signof entry into a Christian community.  If there isn't a commitment from*somebody*, whether parent or child, and no intent to become part ofthe Church, the baptism appears to be a lie.  Furthermore, it islikely to raise serious practical problems.  What if the child is froma baptist tradition?  Normally when he reaches the age of decision, hewould be expected to make a decision and be baptized.  But he alreadyhas been, by a church claiming to be a Baptist church.  So does he getrebaptized?  Neither answer is really very good.  If not, he's beingrobbed of an experience that should be very significant to his faith.--clh]	soc.religion.christian

Getting an image from a computer monitor to a videotapeis harder than it looks.  The standard VGA and EGA outputs are very different than the NTSC format used by televisions.

If you have access to an Amiga computer, that has anNTSC output, you can transfer certain types of graphic files bymodem and tape them from the NTSC output.

We want to be able to print to it from our SGI iris network.  The copier/printer has both a parallel and SCSI interface.  I have configured theprinter with the ""lp"" system using the parallel interface and can print postscript files to the printer.  I can also print rgb files, but these are in turn converted to postscript by an internal filter.  The Canon CLC 500 is a publication quality printer but the quality of our postscript printouts are less than acceptable.  We create the postscript files with a variaty of programs, such as showcase, xv, and tops.  When we convert to postscript with tops and use the -l option to specify the halftone screen density of 98 rather than the default 40 the output is better, but still much less that acceptable.  Note, that we are starting with a screen image in rgb image formatand translating the image into postscript.We suspect that if we could use the SCSI interface we would get higher quality pictures.  We have not purchased the software that drives the printer from the SCSI port.  To my knowledge this software is $5000 and does not come with a warranty.  The management here does not want to spend this much money without some assurance that the product will work.Here my questions:If anybody on the net uses this printer are you using the SCSI or parallel port?  What is the quality of the printouts?Is there a way to create high quality postscript printouts?  What is thelimiting component, the postscript language or the postscript interpretor on the printer? The Big question:Where can I get some software to drive the SCSI port for this printer?Please email directly to me, I don't not read news on a regular basis.

They are news because they are the exceptions. And the 'Islamic Holocaust'is much the topic of the day. The historical evidence proves that during the period of 1914 to 1920, the Armenian Government ordered, incited, assisted and participated in the genocide of 2.5 million Muslim people because of race, religion and national origin. Armenians perpetrated acts of sabotage, destroyed telephone cables, blew up bridges, blocked passes, set up ambushes, attacked security stations and small Turkish outposts behind the Ottoman Army lines on the one hand, and on the other ruthlessly attacked Turkish and Kurdish villages, slaughtering the Turkish population indiscriminately, women, children, old and young alike. Innocent Muslims were one by one cruelly bayonetted to death, or massacred with axes and swords, or else shut up in mosques or in schools and then burntalive as can be seen below.Widespread Armenian massacres of innocent Muslims took place in regions of Van, Kars, Sivas, Erzurum, Bitlis, Erzincan, Mus, Diyarbakir and Maras. The Ottoman Army, while fighting to prevent the Russian invasion,also had to deal with Armenian genocide squads who cowardly hit from behind. The Armenian genocide of the Muslims spread to all parts of Eastern Anatolia. Starting from late 1914, Armenians committed widespread massacres and genocide in Eastern Anatolia, because the arenawas left to the Armenians. Almost every Turkish town and village from Erzincan up to Azerbaidjan suffered large scale massacres and genocide by Armenians and the Turkish genocide has been documented by Armenian, Russian, American, British, Ottoman, German, Austrian and French journalists and officers who observed the first genocide of this centurycommitted by the blood-thirsty Armenian genocide squads.The Ottoman Army, liberating Trabzon, Bayburt, Erzincan, Erzurum, Kars and other regions from the Russians, saw that the cities and their villages had been destroyed and burnt, people slaughtered, massacred.The massacres conducted by Armenians, which became a black stain forhumanity, shocked and disgusted even the Russian, British, German,Austrian, French and American authorities.Almost every Ottoman document is related to Armenian massacres and cruelties. The inhuman treatment, cruelties, atrocities, genocide by Armenian genocide squads perpetrated against innocent Moslem Turkish and Kurdish people, are sufficiently reflected in historical documents. Even today over seventy-five years later, the terrifying screams of the victims of these cruelties can be heard.Source: Documents: Volume I (1919).

Although two months have elapsed since the clearing of the territories of Armenian gangs, I have been observing the evidence of the cruelties of the Armenians at  almost every step. All the villages from Trabzon to Erzincan and from Erzincan to Erzurum are destroyed. Corpses of Turks brutally and cruelly slain are everywhere. According to accounts by those who were able to save their lives by escaping to mountains, the first horrible and fearful events begun when the Russian forces evacuated the places which were then taken over by Armenian gangs. The Russians usually treated the people  well, but the people feared the intervention of the Armenians. Once these places had been taken over by the Armenians, however, the massacres begun. They clearly announced their intention of clearing what they called the Armenian and Kurdish land from the Turks and thus, solve the nationality problem. Today I had the opportunity to meet Austrian and German soldiers who had escaped from Russian prison camps and come from Kars and Alexander Paul (Gumru-Leninakan)...Russian officers tried to save the  Turks and there were clashes between Russian officers and Armenian gangs.  I am now in Erzurum, and what I see is terrible. Almost the whole city is  destroyed. The smell of the corpses still fills the air. Although there are  speculations that Armenian gangs murdered Austrian and German prisoners as  well, I could not get the supporting evidence in this regard, but there is  proof of murdering of Turkish prisoners of war.""

Here is my quandary:  you seem to be arguing that certain types of guns fall outside the scope of the Second.  This isn't a useful argument unless you believe that some significant gun or class of gun belongsin that class.  I think we both agree that zip guns probably aren't protected.  Maybe we also both agree that all the weapons that random state governments have been banning or trying to ban because they have ""no sporting purpose"" and ""no provate citizen would ever need these guns"" DO fall under the protection of the Second.  So, given that damn near any gun of any practical utility is or has at some time been used by the military, even if only for marksmanship training purposes, I need to understand why you are intent on pressing this point, arguing that that SOMETHING is not protected by the Second.> Just because I don't whole-heartedly endorse the NRA position does not> mean that I oppose the RKBA.

Since there is a lot of crossover between gamers andscience fiction and fantasy fans, I will mention that I am the editorand publisher of RADIO FREE THULCANRA, a Christian-oriented sciencefiction fanzine.  It is not a Christian magazine with a specialinterest in science fiction.  It is a science fiction fanzine with aspecial interest in Christianity.  Gaming is not a major topic ofdiscussion but it has come up in some letters.  (No, there are noarguments about whether D&D is satanic.  People who think it is arenot likely to be reading RFT.)

Read it again yourself, then re-apply the admonition you gave to theprevious poster to yourself, as well.  The first clause is not a condition,it is a reason for explicitly supporting the right WHICH EXISTS, MILITIAOR NOT, that the people have a right to keep and bear arms.  This isNOT a right granted by the Constitution, it is a right presumed to existby default.  The Constitution mentioning a right is to prevent thegovernment from removing that right by stating very clearly the governmentshall NOT infringe (mess with, block, limit) that right.  Remember theConstitution is a bunch of negative things - things the government CANNOTdo.  All rights, etc not epxressly given to the government go to thestates and the PEOPLE (the same people the other 9 Amendments in theBill of Rights talk about).Since I am sure you will summarily reject my interpretation, I amappending a linguistic analysis by one far more expert than myself (andyou, I suspect).

Neil SchulmanIf you wanted to know all about the Big Bang, you'd ring up Carl Sagan,right ?  And if you wanted to know about desert warfare, the man to callwould be Norman Schwarzkopf, no question about it.  But who would you callif you wanted the top expert on American usage, to tell you the meaningof the Second Amendment to the United States Constitution ?That was the question I asked A.C. Brocki, editorial coordinator of the LosAngeles Unified School District and formerly senior editor at HoughtonMifflin Publishers -- who himself had been recommended to me as theforemost expert on English usage in the Los Angeles school system.  Mr.Brocki told me to get in touch with Roy Copperud, a retired professorjournalism at the University of Southern California and the author of""American Usage and Style: The Consensus.""A little research lent support to Brocki's opinion of Professor Copperud'sexpertise.Roy Copperud was a newspaper writer on major dailies for over three decadesbefore embarking on a a distinguished 17-year career teaching journalism atUSC.  Since 1952, Copperud has been writing a column dealing with theprofessional aspects of journalism for ""Editor and Publisher"", a weeklymagazine focusing on the journalism field.He's on the usage panel of the American Heritage Dictionary, and MerriamWebster's Usage Dictionary frequently cites him as an expert.  Copperud'sfifth book on usage, ""American Usage and Style: The Consensus,"" has been incontinuous print from Van Nostrand Reinhold since 1981, and is the winnerof the Association of American Publisher's Humanities Award.That sounds like an expert to me.After a brief telephone call to Professor Copperud in which I introducedmyself but did not give him any indication of why I was interested, I sentthe following letter:""I am writing you to ask you for your professional opinion as an expert inEnglish usage, to analyze the text of the Second Amendment to the UnitedStates Constitution, and extract the intent from the text.""The text of the Second Amendment is, 'A well-regulated Militia, beingnecessary for the security of a free State, the right of the people to keepand bear Arms, shall not be infringed.'""The debate over this amendment has been whether the first part of thesentence, 'A well-regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of afree State', is a restrictive clause or a subordinate clause, with respectto the independent clause containing the subject of the sentence, 'theright of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed.'""I would request that your analysis of this sentence not take intoconsideration issues of political impact or public policy, but be restrictedentirely to a linguistic analysis of its meaning and intent.  Further,since your professional analysis will likely become part of litigationregarding the consequences of the Second Amendment, I ask that whateveranalysis you make be a professional opinion that you would be willing tostand behind with your reputation, and even be willing to testify underoath to support, if necessary.""My letter framed several questions about the test of the Second Amendment,then concluded:""I realize that I am asking you to take on a major responsibility and taskwith this letter.  I am doing so because, as a citizen, I believe it isvitally important to extract the actual meaning of the Second Amendment.While I ask that your analysis not be affected by the political importance ofits results, I ask that you do this because of that importance.""After several more letters and phone calls, in which we discussed terms forhis doing such an analysis, but in which we never discussed either of ouropinions regarding the Second Amendment, gun control, or any other politicalsubject, Professor Copperud sent me the follow analysis (into which I haveinserted my questions for the sake of clarity):[Copperud:] ""The words 'A well-regulated militia, being necessary to thesecurity of a free state,' contrary to the interpretation cited in yourletter of July 26, 1991, constitutes a present participle, rather than aclause.  It is used as an adjective, modifying 'militia,' which isfollowed by the main clause of the sentence (subject 'the right', verb'shall').  The to keep and bear arms is asserted as an essential formaintaining a militia.""In reply to your numbered questions:[Schulman:] ""(1) Can the sentence be interpreted to grant the right to keepand bear arms solely to 'a well-regulated militia'?""[Copperud:] ""(1) The sentence does not restrict the right to keep and beararms, nor does it state or imply possession of the right elsewhere or byothers than the people; it simply makes a positive statement with respectto a right of the people.""[Schulman:] ""(2) Is 'the right of the people to keep and bear arms' grantedby the words of the Second Amendment, or does the Second Amendment assume apreexisting right of the people to keep and bear arms, and merely statethat such right 'shall not be infringed'?""[Copperud:] ""(2) The right is not granted by the amendment; its existenceis assumed.  The thrust of the sentence is that the right shall bepreserved inviolate for the sake of ensuring a militia.""[Schulman:] ""(3) Is the right of the people to keep and bear armsconditioned upon whether or not a well regulated militia, is, in factnecessary to the security of a free State, and if that condition is notexisting, is the statement 'the right of the people to keep and bear Arms,shall not be infringed' null and void?""[Copperud:] ""(3) No such condition is expressed or implied.  The right tokeep and bear arms is not said by the amendment to depend on the existenceof a militia.  No condition is stated or implied as to the relation of theright to keep and bear arms and to the necessity of a well-regulatedmilitia as a requisite to the security of a free state.  The right to keepand bear arms is deemed unconditional by the entire sentence.""[Schulman:] ""(4) Does the clause 'A well-regulated Militia, being necessaryto the security of a free State,' grant a right to the government to placeconditions on the 'right of the people to keep and bear arms,' or is suchright deemed unconditional by the meaning of the entire sentence?""[Copperud:] ""(4) The right is assumed to exist and to be unconditional, aspreviously stated.  It is invoked here specifically for the sake of themilitia.""[Schulman:] ""(5) Which of the following does the phrase 'well-regulatedmilitia' mean: 'well-equipped', 'well-organized,' 'well-drilled,''well-educated,' or 'subject to regulations of a superior authority'?""[Copperud:] ""(5) The phrase means 'subject to regulations of a superiorauthority;' this accords with the desire of the writers for civiliancontrol over the military.""[Schulman:] ""(6) (If at all possible, I would ask you to take account thechanged meanings of words, or usage, since that sentence was written 200years ago, but not take into account historical interpretations of theintents of the authors, unless those issues can be clearly separated.""[Copperud:] ""To the best of my knowledge, there has been no change in themeaning of words or in usage that would affect the meaning of theamendment.  If it were written today, it might be put: ""Since awell-regulated militia is necessary tot he security of a free state, theright of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be abridged.'[Schulman:] ""As a 'scientific control' on this analysis, I would alsoappreciate it if you could compare your analysis of the text of the SecondAmendment to the following sentence,""A well-schooled electorate, being necessary to the security of a freeState, the right of the people to keep and read Books, shall not beinfringed.'""My questions for the usage analysis of this sentence would be,""(1) Is the grammatical structure and usage of this sentence and the waythe words modify each other, identical to the Second Amendment's sentence?;and""(2) Could this sentence be interpreted to restrict 'the right of the peopleto keep and read Books' _only_ to 'a well-educated electorate' -- forexample, registered voters with a high-school diploma?""[Copperud:] ""(1) Your 'scientific control' sentence precisely parallels theamendment in grammatical structure.""(2) There is nothing in your sentence that either indicates or implies thepossibility of a restricted interpretation.""Professor Copperud had only one additional comment, which he placed in hiscover letter: ""With well-known human curiosity, I made some speculativeefforts to decide how the material might be used, but was unable to reachany conclusion.""So now we have been told by one of the top experts on American usage whatmany knew all along: the Constitution of the United States unconditionallyprotects the people's right to keep and bear arms, forbidding allgovernments formed under the Constitution from abridging that right.As I write this, the attempted coup against constitutional government in theSoviet Union has failed, apparently because the will of the people in thatpart of the world to be free from capricious tyranny is stronger than theold guard's desire to maintain a monopoly on dictatorial power.And here in the United States, elected lawmakers, judges, and appointedofficials who are pledged to defend the Constitution of the United Statesignore, marginalize, or prevaricate about the Second Amendment routinely.American citizens are put in American prisons for carrying arms, owningarms of forbidden sorts, or failing to satisfy bureaucratic requirementsregarding the owning and carrying of firearms -- all of which is anabridgement of the unconditional right of the people to keep and bear arms,guaranteed by the Constitution.And even the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), staunch defender of therest of the Bill of Rights, stands by and does nothing.it seems it is up to those who believe in the right to keep and bear arms topreserve that right.  no one else will.  No one else can.  Will we beg ourelected representatives not to take away our rights, and continue regardingthem as representing us if they do?  Will we continue obeying judges whodecide that the Second Amendment doesn't mean what it says it means butmeans whatever they say it means in their Orwellian doublespeak ?Or will be simply keep and bear the arms of our choice, as the Constitutionof the United States promises us we can, and pledge that we will defendthat promise with our lives, our fortuned, and our sacred honor ?(C) 1991 by The New Gun Week and Second Amendment Foundation.Informational reproduction of the entire article is hereby authorizedprovided the author, The New Gun Week and Second Amendment Foundation arecredited.

An averageeuropean player from Sweden, Finland, Russian or Tsech/Slovakia is a better skater and  puckhandler than his NHL colleague. Especially defenders in NHLare mainly slow and clumsy. Sel{nne has also said that in the Finnish Sm-leaguegame is more based on skill than in NHL. In Finland he couldn't get so many breakaways because defenders here are an average much better skaters than inNHL. Also Alpo Suhonen said that in NHL Sel{nne's speed accentuates becauseof clumsy defensemen.I have to admit that the best players come from Canada, but those regularsaren't as skilful as regulars in the best european leagues. Also top europeansare in the same level as the best north-americans.(except Lemieux is in theclass of his own). Tommi	rec.sport.hockey

A 3-D widget is usually located in the same scene as other 3-D objects of the application.  It may let you- manipulate application data, the camera,  3-D objects in the scene and so on, or- view the status of the application or 3-D objects  via the widget's shape, color, position, orientation and so on, or- do whatever I missed but you think is possible.For example, a manipulative widget can be virtual trackball (shown as apartially transparent sphere) super-imposed on the object to be rotated.A feedback widget can be a ruler with ends anchored to 2 objects.  The lengthof the ruler changes as the objects move and a numeric value is shown on theruler indicating the distance.  A widget can provide both manipulation andfeedback.  For example, the ruler can be used to change the distance betweenthe objects along its own axis.Please e-mail me or post your opinions on 3-D interaction.  The informationI gathered will help me design a 3-D UI construction tool.Your help is very much appreciated.Tony Lau<tlau@cs.ubc.ca>M.Sc. StudentDept. of Computer Science	comp.graphics

Where were they?                An Appeal to MankindDuring the last three years Azerbaijan and its multinationalpopulation are vainly fighting for justice within the limits ofthe Soviet Union. All humanitarian, constitutional human rightsguaranteed by the UN Charter, Universal Declaration of HumanRights, Helsinki Agreements, Human Problems International Forums,documents signed by the Soviet Union - all of them are violated.The USSR's President, government bodies do not defend Azerbaijanthough they are all empowered to take necessary measures toguarantee life and peace.The 140,000 strong army of Armenian terrorists with Moscow'stacit consent wages an undeclared war of annihilation againstAzerbaijan. As a result, a part of Azerbaijan has been occupiedand annexed, hundreds of people killed, thousands wounded.Some 200,000 Azerbaijanis have been brutally and inhumanlydeported from the Armenian SSR, their historical homeland.Together with them 64,000 Russians and 22,000 Kurds have alsobeen driven out, a part of them now settled in Azerbaijan.Some 40,000 Turkish-Meskhetians, Lezghins and representatives of other Caucasian nationalities who escaped from the CentralAsia where the President and government bodies did not guaranteethem the life and peace also suffered from these deportations.One of the scandalous vandalisms directed not only againstAzerbaijan science but the world civilization as well is theArmenian extremists' destruction of the Karabakh scientificexperimental base of The Institute of Genetics and Selection of the Academy of Sciences of the Azerbaijan SSR.We beg you for humanitarian help and political assistance,for the honour and dignity of 7 million Azerbaijanis areviolated, its territory, culture  and history are trampled,its people are shot. There is persistent negative image ofAzerbaijanians abroad, and this defamation is spread over the whole world by Soviet mass media, Armenian lobby in theUSSR and the United States. One of the myths is that all events allegedly involves andgenerated by interethnic collisions and religious intolerancewhile the truth is that all these shootings and recent events stem from the territorial claims of Armenia onAzerbaijan.It is a well documented fact that before the conflict therewere no frictions between Armenians and Azerbaijanis on theissue of Karabakh. Hundreds and thousands Armenians placidlyand calmly lived and worked in Azerbaijan land, had theirrepresentatives in all government bodies of the AzerbaijanSSR.We are for a united, indivisible, sovereign Azerbaijan, we are for a common Caucasian home proclaimed in 1918 by oneof the founding fathers of the Azerbaijan Democratic Republic - Muhammed Emin Rasulzade.But all these goals and expectations are trampled upon theSoviet leadership in favour of the Armenian expansionistsencouraged by Moscow and intended to create a new '1,000Year Reich' - the 'Great Armenia' - by annexing the neighboring lands.The world public opinion shed tears to save the whales,suffers for penguins dying out in the Antarctic Continent.But what about the lives of seven million human beings?If these people are Muslims, does it mean that they areless valuable? Can people be discriminated by their colour of skin or religion, by their residence or otherattributes?All people are brothers, and we appeal to our brothersfor help and understanding. This is not the first appealof Azerbaijan to the world public opinion. Our previousappeals were unheard. However, we still carry the hopethat the truth beyond the Russian and Armenian propagandawill one day reveal the extent of our suffering andstimulate at least as much help and compassion forAzerbaijan as tendered to whales and penguins.

The Armenians are Christians, theAzerbaijanis are Moslems, and Islam is a religion especially unlovedby the democrat-westernizers. Besides, at the root of this conflictlie the territorial claims on Azerbaijan, a consequence of whichwere the blood and suffering of innocent Azeri people, hundreds ofthousands of refugees, and gross violations of human rights. Recently Armenians attacked the Azeri town of Khojaly and massacredthousands of Azeris. The Paris-based 'Association for Democracy andHuman Rights in Azerbaijan' puts the number of Khojali victimsat 3,145. Some of the dead were scalped and mutilated.

The scenario and genocide staged by the Armenians 78 years ago in the Ottoman Empire is being reenacted again - this time in Azerbaijan. There are remarkable similarities between the plots, the perpetrators, and the underdogs. Report taken from The New York Times, Tuesday, March 3, 1992                    MASSACRE BY ARMENIANS BEING REPORTED     Agdam,Azerbaijan,March 2 (Reuters) - Fresh evidence emerged today of a massacre of civilians by Armenian militants in Nagorno-Karabakh, a predominantly Armenian enclave of Azerbaijan.     The republic of Armenia reiterated denials that its militants had killed1,000 people in the Azerbaijani populated town of Khojaly last week and massacred men, women and children fleeing the carnage across snow-coveredmountain passes.     But dozen of bodies scattered over the area lent credence to Azerbaijanireports of a massacre.                         Scalping Reported     Azerbaijani officials and journalists who flew briefly to the regionby helicopter brought back three dead children with the back of theirheads blown off. They said shooting by Armenians has prevented them from retrieving more bodies.     ""Women and children have been scalped,"" said Assad Faradshev, an aideto Nagorno-Karabakh's Azerbaijani Governor. ""When we began to pick up bodies,they began firing at us.""     The Azerbaijani militia chief in Agdam, Rashid Mamedov, said: ""The bodiesare lying there like flocks of sheep. Even the fascists did nothing like this.""                                                  Truckloads of Bodies     Near Agdam on the outskirts of Nagorno-Karabakh, a Reuters photographer,Frederique Lengaigne, said she had seen two trucks filled with Azerbaijanibodies.     ""In the first one I counted 35, and it looked as though there were asmany in the second,"" she said. ""Some had their head cut off, and many hadbeen burned. They were all men, and a few had been wearing khaki uniforms.Serdar Argic                           'We closed the roads and mountain passes that                             might serve as ways of escape for the Turks                             and then proceeded in the work of extermination.'

Anti-fighting people may want to skip this post.)Topics------Don's Tie, Grant Fuhr, Penalties, Wings vs Leafs, Fighting, Dale Hunter.Episode Summary---------------This episode began with the camera zoomed in on Don's tie. Don waspointing out the characters on the tie... Bugs Bunny, Foghorn Leghorn,and Yosemite Sam (who Don called Lanny Macdonald.)Ron Maclean began by mentioning that Don was almost evicted from ahotel where he was watching the previous night's games, because ofall the yelling and cheering he was doing over the play of Hunterand Fuhr.Don began to praise Fuhr, calling him the ""greatest goalie"", andsaid that he's winning the series against Boston all by himself.He then showed clips from earlier episodes (Nov. 14, Jan. 16) whenFuhr was still with the Leafs, and Don advised ""Don't Trade Fuhr!""Don went on to predict that if Buffalo gets by Boston, it wouldbe Fuhr who wins the series. Muckler took a lot of heat for thetrade, but Don feels Muckler's been vindicated.The next topic involved how playoff games are being ruined bytoo many penalty calls. He showed a clip from a Winnipeg-Vancouvergame, where Domi hit a Vancouver player, and was given a 2 min. penalty.Ron said that it was called a penalty because his stick was involved,but Don stuck with the opinion that it was a good hit, with Domihitting the Vancouver player with his shoulder. Don: ""Its sad whatthey're doing for hockey... a 5 minute penalty for a nosebleed.""Next, they went to the playoff series between Detroit and Toronto.People in Detroit were calling Wendel Clarke ""Wendy"" for not fighting.However, Don pointed out that Probert was not fighting either.This lead Don into a tirad about fighting and stickwork, and howbanning fighting leads to more high sticking: ""It's like collegehockey... The little wee guy with the visor is brave as anybody.That's why you're seeing so much stickwork. Because they know youwon't drop your gloves and give them a shot. The rules are madeby people who don't know what's going on in hockey"".The final topic Don discussed was Dale Hunter. Don pointed outthat he was leading the league in goals, and showed a clipof Hunter from a previous game. When he was younger, Hunter wastaught to ""play to win"", which differs from today's idea ofjust letting kids have fun.At then end of the episode, they showed a clip from a coach'scorner, with the tape on fast forward, so that Don sounded likeone of the chipmunks.Rating------Typical anti-fighting posturing, not too much humour, but somegood quotes.I'd give it a 7.0 out of 10.------------------------------------------------------------------------------   \  \                   |Allan Sullivan (allan@cs.ualberta.ca)    \  \                  |Department of Computing Science,     \  \_______          |University of Alberta, Edmonton, Alberta, Canada.      \    ###  \     _   |---------------------------------------------------       \___###___\   (_)  |My opinions are mine and mine alone.------------------------------------------------------------------------------""It is amazing how much can be accomplished if no one cares who gets the credit...""          - U. of A.

Let me tell you who the quacks really are, these are the physicans who have no idea how the human body interacts with it's environment and how that balance can be altered by diet and antibiotics.  These are the physicians who dismiss their patients with difficult symptomatology and make them go from doctor to doctor to find relief(like Elaine in Sci. Med. Nutrition) and then when they find one that solves their problem, the rest start yelling quack.  Could it just be professional jealousy?  I couldn't help Elaine or Jonbut somebody else did.  Could they know more than Me?  No way, they must be a quack.  I've been teaching a human nutrition course for Medical students for over ten years now and guess who the most receptive students are?  Those that were raised on farms and saw first-hand the effect of diet on the health of their farm animals and those students who had made a dramatic diet change prior to entering medical school(switched to the vegan diet).  Typically, this is about 1/3 of my class of 90 students.  Those not interested in nutrition either tune me out or just stop coming to class.  That's okay because I know that some of what I'm teaching is going to stick and there will be at least a few ""enlightened"" physicians practicing in the U.S.  It's really too bad that most U.S. medical schools don't cover nutrition because if they did, candida would not be viewed as a non-disease by so many in the medical profession.In animal husbandry, an animal is reinnoculated with ""good"" bacteria after antibiotics are stopped.  Medicine has decided that since humans do not have a ruminant stomach, no such reinnoculation with ""good"" bacteria is needed after coming off a braod spectrum antibiotic.  Humans have all kinds of different organisms living in the GI system(mouth, stomach, small and large intestine), sinuses, vagina and on the skin.  These are nonpathogenic because they do not cause disease in people unless the immune system is compromised.  They are also called nonpathogens because unlike the pathogenic organisms that cause human disease, they do not produce toxins as they live out their merry existence in and on our body.  But any of these organisms will be considered pathogenic if it manages to take up residence within the body.  A poor mucus membrane barrier can let this happen and vitamin A is mainly responsible for setting up this barrier.Steve got real upset with Elaine's doctor because he was using anti-fungals and vitamin A for her GI problems.  If Steve really understoood what vitamin A does in the body, he would not(or at least should not) be calling Elaine's doctor a quack.Here is a brief primer on yeast.  Yeast infections, as they are commonly called, are not truely caused by yeasts.  The most common organism responsiblefor this type of infection is Candida albicans or Monilia which is actually a yeast-like fungus.  An infection caused by this organism is called candidiasis.Candidiasis is a very rare occurance because, like an E. Coli infection, it requires that the host immune system be severly depressed.  Candida is frequently found on the skin and all of the mucous membranes of normal healthy people and it rarely becomes a problem unless some predisposingfactor is present such as a high blood glucose level(diabetes) or an oral course of antibiotics has been used.  In diabetics, their secretions contain much higher amounts of glucose.  Candida, unlike bacteria, is very limited in it's food(fuel) selection.  Without glucose, it can not grow, it just barely survives.  If it gets access to a lot of glucose, it blooms and over rides the other organisms living with it in the sinuses, GI tract or vagina.  In diabetics, skin lesions can also foster a good bloom site for these little buggers.  The bloom is usually just a minor irritant in most people but some people do really develop a bad inflammatory process at the mucus membrane or skin bloom site.  Whether this is an allergic like reaction to the candida or not isn't certain.  When the bloom is in the vagina or on the skin, it can be easliy seen and some doctors do then try to ""treat"" it.If it's internal, only symptoms can be used and these symptoms are pretty nondiscript.  Candida is kept in check in most people by the normal bacterial flora in the sinuses, the GI tract(mouth, stomach and intestines) and in the vaginal tract which compete with it for food.  The human immune system ususally does not bother itself with these(nonpathogenic organisms) unless they broach the mucus membrane ""barrier"".  If they do, an inflammatory response will be set up.  Most Americans are not getting enough vitamin A from their diets.  About 30% of all American's die with less Vitamin A than they were born with(U.S. autopsy studies).  While this low level of vitamin A does not cause pathology(blindness) it does impair the mucus membrane barrier system.  This would then be a predisposing factor for a strong inflammatory response after a candida bloom.  While diabetics can suffer from a candida ""bloom"" the  most common cause of this type of bloom is the use of broad spectrum antibiotics which knock down many different kinds of bacteria in the body and remove the main competition for candida as far as food is concerned.  While drugs are available to handle candida, many patients find that their doctor will not use them unless there is evidence of a systemic infection.  The toxicity of the anti-fungal drugs does warrant some caution.  But if the GI or sinus inflammation is suspected to be candida(and recent use of a broad spectrum antibiotic is the smoking gun), then anti-fungal use should be approrpriate just as the anti-fungal creams are an appropriate treatment for recurring vaginal yeast infections, in spite of what Mr. Steve Dyer says.But even in patients being given the anti-fungals, the irritation caused by the excessive candida bloom in the sinus, GI tract or the vagina tends to return after drug treatment is discontinued unless the underlying cause of the problem is addressed(lack of a ""good"" bacterial flora in the body and/or poor mucus membrane barrier).  Lactobacillus acidophilus is the most effective therapy for candida overgrowth.  From it's name, it is an acid loving organism and it sets up an acidic condition were it grows.  Candida can not grow very well in an acidic environment.  In the vagina, L. acidophilius is the predominate bacteria(unless you are hit with broad spectrum antibiotics).  In the GI system, the ano-rectal region seems to be a particularly good reservoir for candida and the use of pantyhose by many women creates a very favorable environment around the rectum for transfer(through moisture and humidity) of candida to the vaginal tract.  One of the most effctive ways to minimmize this transfer is to wear undyed cotton underwear.  If the bloom occurs in the anal area, the burning, swelling, pain and even blood discharge make many patients think that they have hemorroids.  If the bloom manages to move further up the GI tract, very diffuse symptomatology occurs(abdominal discomfort and blood in the stool).  This positive stool for occult blood is what sent Elaine to her family doctor in the first place.  After extensive testing, he told her that there was nothing wrong but her gut still hurt.  On to another doctor, and so on.  Richard Kaplan has told me throiugh e-mail that he considers occult blood tests in stool specimens to be a waste of time and money because of the very large number of false positives(candida blooms guys?).  If my gut hurt me on a constant basis, I would want it fixed.  Yes it's nice to know that I don't have colon cancer but what then is causing my distress?  When I finally find a doctor who treats me and gets me 90% better, Steve Dyer calls him a quack.Candida prefers a slightly alkaline environment while bacteria tend to prefer a slightly acidic environment.  The vagina becomes alkaline during a woman's period and this is often when candida blooms in the vagina. Vinegar and water douches are the best way of dealing with vaginal problems.  Many women have also gotten relief from the introduction of Lactobacillus directly into the vaginal tract(I would want to be sure of the purity of the product before trying this).  My wife had this vagina problem after going on birth control pills and searched for over a year until she found a gynocologist who solved the problem rather than just writting scripts for anti-fungal creams.  This was a woman gynocologist who had had the same problem(recurring vaginal yeast infections).  This M.D. did some digging and came up with an acetic acid and L. Acidophilis douche which she used in your office to keep it sterile.  After three treatments, sex returned to our marraige.  I have often wondered what an M.D. with chronic GI distress or sinus problems would do about the problem that he tells his patients is a non-existent syndrome.The nonpathogenic bacteria L. acidophilus is an acid producing bacteria which is the most common bacteria found in the vaginal tract of healthy women.  If taken orally, it can also become a major bacteria in the gut.  Through aresol sprays, it has also been used to innoculate the sinus membranes.But before this innoculation occurs, the mucus membrane barrier system needs to be strengthened.  This is accomplished by vitamin A, vitamin C and some of the B-complex vitamins.  Diet surveys repeatedly show that Americans are not getting enough B6 and folate.  These are probably the segement of the population that will have the greatest problem with this non-existent disorder(candida blooms after antibiotic therapy). Some of the above material was obtained from ""Natural Healing"" by Mark Bricklin, Published by Rodale press, as well as notes from my human nutrition course.  I will be posting a discussion of vitamin A  sometime in the future, along with reference citings to point out the extremely important role that vitamin A plays in the mucus membrane defense system in the body and why vitamin A should be effective in dealing with candida blooms.  Another effective dietary treatment is to restrict carbohydrate intake during the treatment phase, this is especially important if the GI system is involved.  If candida can not get glucose, it's not going to out grow the bacteria and you then give bacteria, which can use amino acids and fatty acids for energy, a chance to take over and keep the candida in check once carbohydrate is returned to the gut.If Steve and some of the other nay-sayers want to jump all over this post, fine.  I jumped all over Steve in Sci. Med. Nutrition because he verbably accosted a poster who was seeking advice about her doctor's use of vitamin A and anti-fungals for a candida bloom in her gut.  People seeking advice from newsnet should not be treated this way.  Those of us giving of our time and knowledge can slug it out to our heart's content.  If you saved your venom for me Steve and left the helpless posters who are timidly seeking help alone, I wouldn't have a problem with your behavior.

I argued this thoroughly about 3-4 weeks ago.  Men and women aredifferent ... physically, physiologically, and psychologically.  Muchrecent evidence for this statement is present in the book ""Brainsex"" byAnne Moir and David Jessel.  I recommend you find a copy and read it.Their book is an overview of recent scientific research on this topicand is well referenced. Now, if women and men are different in some ways, the law can onlyadequately take into account their needs in these areas where they aredifferent by also taking into account the ways in which men and womenare different.  Maternity leave is an example of this -- it takes intoaccount that women get pregnant.  It does not give women the same rulesit would give to men, because to treat women like it treats men in thisinstance would be unjust.  This is just simply an obvious example ofwhere men and women are intrinsically different!!!!!Now, people make the _naive_ argument that sexism = oppression.However, maternity leave is sexist because MEN DO NOT GET PREGNANT. Men do not have the same access to leave that women do (not to the sameextent or degree), and therefore IT IS SEXIST.  No matter however much aman _wants_ to get pregnant and have maternity leave, HE NEVER CAN.  Andtherefore the law IS SEXIST.  No man can have access to maternity leave,NO MATTER HOW HARD HE TRIES TO GET PREGNANT.  I hope this is clear.Maternity leave is an example where a sexist law is just, because thesexism here just reflects the ""sexism"" of nature in making men and womendifferent.  There are many other differences between men and women whichare far more subtle than pregnancy, and to find out more of these Irecommend you have a look at the book ""Brainsex"".Your point that perhaps some day men can also be pregnant is fallacious.If men can one day become pregnant it will be by having biologicallybecome women!  To have a womb and the other factors required forpregnancy is usually wrapped up in the definition of what a woman is --so your argument, when it is examined, is seen to be fallacious.  Youare saying that men can have the sexist maternity leave privilege that women can have if they also become women -- which actually just supportsmy statement that maternity leave is sexist.>The discrimination comes in when a woman is denied opportunities>because of her (legally determined) sexual inferiorities.

All I said was that a right is whateveryou or somebody acting for you can enforce.  The Bill of Rights didn'tcome into effect until it was ratified by the states (and indirectly,the people); from that point it defined legal rights.  ""Common law""rights are vague and situational; that's why the people insisted on aBill of Rights in the Constitution, spelling out exactly what theydemanded from the government.  Legitimate or illegitimate, power ispower.  That's why the federal government can force states to granttheir citizens rights they don't wish to: In a slugging match, the fedswin.  Period.

I think basically the reasoning was that the>tradition in the Church held that Mary was also without sin as was Jesus.Yes.  For examples of this in the writings of the early fathers, consider:    You alone and your Mother        are more beautiful than any others;    For there is no blemish in you,        nor any stains upon your Mother.    Who of my children        can compare in beauty to these?                -- St. Ephrem the Syrian, Nisibene Hymns, 27:8, around                   A.D. 370    Lift me up not from Sara but from Mary, a Virgin not only undefiled     but a Virgin whom grace has made inviolate, free of every stain of sin.                -- St. Ambrose, ""Commentary on Psalm 118"", 22:30, ca. A.D. 388There are many others.>As the tenets of faith developed, particularly with Augustine, sin was>more and more equated with sex, and thus Mary was assumed to be a virgin>for life (since she never sinned, and since she was the spouse of God, etc.)No.  We have, for instance:    Was there ever anyone of any breeding who dared to speak the name of    Holy Mary, and being questioned, did not immediately add, ""the Virgin""?    ... And to Holy Mary, Virgin is invariably added, for that Holy Woman    remains undefiled.                -- St. Epiphanus of Salamis, ""Panacea against all heresies"",                   between A.D. 374-377.    We surely cannot deny that you were right in correcting the doctrine    about children of Mary ... For the Lord Jesus would not have chosen    to be born of a virgin if He had judged that she would be so incontinent    as to taint the birthplace of the Body of the Lord, home of the Eternal    King, with the seed of human intercourse.  Anyone who proposes this is    merely proposing ... that Christ could not be born of a virgin.                -- Pope St. Siricius, Letter to Anysius, Bishop of                    Thessalonica, A.D. 392Note that St. Augustine's conversion to Christianity was in A.D. 387.  Idon't know offhand when his election as bishop of Hippo was, but I'm quitesure it was after 392.  The belief in Mary's perpetual virginity originatedlong before Augustine's time.  We hold that it originated with the Apostles.Strictly speaking, however, Mary's perpetual virginity is independentof her Immaculate Conception.  Mary could have been Immaculately Conceived and not remained a virgin; she could have remained a virginand not been Immaculately Conceived.>Since we also had this notion of original sin, ie. that man is born with>a predisposition to sin, and since Mary did not have this predisposition>because she did not ever sin, she didn't have original sin.  When science>discovered the process of conception, the next step was to assume that>Mary was conceived without original sin, the Immaculate Conception.No.  It has been held in the Church since ancient times that originalsin was transmitted at conception, when a person's life begins.Biology had nothing to do with it.  Prayerfully reflecting on thetruth of Mary's sinlessness, and the means by which God could haveachieved this, the Church arrived at the truth of the ImmaculateConception.  Thus, the Immaculate Conception is not a new doctrine,but the logical result of our understanding of two old ones.The celebration of the Feast of the Immaculate Conception itself wasgiven by Pope Sixtus IV (1471-84) and the Feast was made a preceptfeast of the Church by Pope Clement XI (1700-21).>Mary at that time appeared to a girl named Bernadette at Lourdes.  She >refered to herself as the Immaculate Conception.  Since a nine year old >would have no way of knowing about the doctrine, the apparition was deemed>to be true and it sealed the case for the doctrine.No.  First of all, Lourdes is private revelation, and doctrine is notbased on private revelation.  The most that private revelation can dois enhance and deepen our understanding of existing public revelation,which ended with the death of St. John the Apostle.Second, the ""case for the doctrine"" was irreformably sealed in 1854 with the ex cathedra promulgation of the Bull ""Ineffabilis Deus"" byPope Pius IX.  This meant that the doctrine was formally recognized asa dogma; a dogma, by definition, cannot change and is required to bebelieved by the faithful.The apparition at Lourdes happened in 1858, four years later.  The mostthat might be claimed is that Lourdes gave the infallible proclamationof 1854 a sort of heavenly stamp of approval, but the Church has neverclaimed that, nor shall she.In Christ's Peace,Brad Kaiser(bradk@isdgsm.eurpd.csg.mot.com)	  Those who trust in Him shall understand truth,	  and the faithful shall abide with Him in love;	  Because grace and mercy are with His holy ones,	  and His care is with His elect.		    -- Wis 3:9 [NAB]"	soc.religion.christian

Andrew Byler)Subject: Re: Sabbath Admissions 5of5All of the arguments concerning the Sabbath ought to make the pointpretty clear - anyone outside of the Catholic or Orthodox orAnglican orMonophysite churches ourght to worship on Saturday if they are reallysola scriptura.  Otherwise, they are following a law put into effect bythe Church, and only the above Chruches really recognize any power ofthe Chruch to do so.Andy Byler[You will note that nothing in the FAQ said anything about the Churchestablishing or changing a law.  The argument against the Sabbath isthat it is part of the ceremonial law, and like the rest of theceremonial law is not binding on Christians.  This argument is basedon Paul's letters, Acts, and in a more general sense, Jesus'teachings.  Further, most people argue that Scripture shows worshipoccuring on Sunday, and Paul endorsing it.  I understand that thesepoints are disputed, and do not want to go around the dispute one moretime.  The point I'm making here is not that these arguments areright, but that the backing they claim is Scripture.Accepting the principle of ""sola scriptura"" does not commit us toobeying the entire Jewish Law.  Acts 15 and Paul's letters are quiteclear on that.  I think even the SDA's accept it.  The disagreement ison where the Bible would have us place the line.By the way, Protestants do give authority to the church, in mattersthat are not dictated by God.  That's why churches are free todetermine their own liturgies, church polity, etc.  If you accept thatthe Sabbath is not binding on Christians, then the day of worshipfalls into the category of items on which individual Christians or(since worship is by its nature a group activity) churches are free todecide.--clh]"	soc.religion.christian

And ""valuable to his team"" was not, and should notbe, considered synonymous with ""best"".  We are talking about a time whenhonour and attitude, not measurable skills, were the most important assetsa player brought to his team, his league and his sport.

A manager, much like a military officer,needs to have his (her) players' complete obedience and respect duringa game.  After the game, it's no big deal, but when there is no time to do more than react, players must trust the manager or the team oftenfalls apart (see: Boston Red Sox, ff. :) )  Strawberry's demeanor as represented by the media, often sounds likedemands.  I suspect that a comment like ""I enjoy hitting fourth; I'mused to it"" would get pretty brutally misinterpreted by the media ifit came from Strawberry.  Russ Porter quoted Strawberry as saying,""I feel more comfortable hitting cleanup and I think I perform bestin that role.""  (Paraphrased by my memory and bias.)  That seems likea fairly non-petulant answer to what was almost certainly a question like, ""How do you feel about being moved to the third spot in the order?""A more media-sensitive player might answer ""The manager knows what he isdoing.  If he thinks that batting me third will help the team, then Iam all for it.""  We'd ignore that answer as brown stuff, so it seems alittle bit of an overreaction to brand Darryl's response as petulant.Personally, I think his argument is nonsense and that it really doesn'tmatter much in which order the #2-5 players in the order are batted,except for personal stats.  If I were Darryl, I'd probably answer thatquestion, ""The number four spot gets a few more RBI opportunities and I getpaid for RBIs.  I think it is best for me to bat fourth, but I am willingto hit third if Tommy thinks it will benefit the team.""  or something likethat.  It would be helpful at salary time--my RBIs were down because I washitting third--and make him sound like a ""team"" player.  Since Strawberrywill not likely go through arbitration, but use the free agent market forhis next contract, maybe that argument is useless, but it would help   his image with the media without appearing to be totally content-free.Remember, the media is of the belief that one's best RBI man should hitfourth, so the argument is sensible, regardless of whether or not it istrue.					--Jeff"	rec.sport.baseball

Since Matt has a terrible batting eye,this helps the Giants a lot.When Bonds gets on base all by himself, he can try to steal 2ndand then be driven in with a single by Thompson, Manwaring, or Clayton.If you bat Bonds before the other sluggers, then you don't wanthim to run because a ""caught stealing"" could take you out of abig inning.Also Bonds is less in need of protection behind him because heis such a good base stealer (a walk is a potential double).The only draw back is when Clark and Williams are clogging up the bases infront of Bonds... and I think that's a problem the Giants will be glad to see especially if Robby Thompson gets hot.Ken Kubey         kubey@wpd.sgi.com  (415) 390-3536"	rec.sport.baseball

If you get someone qualified for the 60-day that reduces the frequency of re-evaluations.  There is no longer, I believe, any limit to the number of players you can place on the DL.

If this is true,how can >this possibly be fair to the infants?What do you mean fair?  God is just, giving to everyone what theydeserve. As all infants are in sin from the time of conception (cfRomans 5.12, Psalm 1.7), they cannot possibly merit heaven, and aspurgatory is for the purging of temporal punishment and venial sins, itis impossible that origianl sin can be forgiven.  Hence, the unbaptizedinfants are cut off from the God against whom they, with the whole ofthe human race except Mary, have sinned.

We also have a new spare Connor 40MBdisk which we would like to use. The idea is to replace the brokenfloppy drive with the new hard disk, but there seems to be someproblems:The internal SCSI cable and power cable inside the cx has onlyconnectors for one single hard disk drive.If I made a ribbon cable and a power cable with three connectors each(1 for motherboard, 1 for each of the 2 disks), would it work?Is the IIcx able to supply the extra power to the extra disk?What about terminators? I suppose that i should remove the resistorpacks from the disk that is closest to the motherboard, but leave theminstalled in the other disk.The SCSI ID jumpers should also be changed so that the new disk getsID #1. The old one should have ID #0.It is no problem for us to remove the floppy drive, as we have anexternal floppy that we can use if it won't boot of the hard disk.Thank you!----------------------------------------------------------------------Torbj|rn Rognes                            Email: rogntorb@idt.unit.no	comp.sys.mac.hardware

Hence, any apparent>similarity in handling characteristics may, or may *not* be analagous>in its underlying physics to that behind motorcycle handling>characteristics.OK, as one last attempt, I'll take a different tack.We all seem to be in agreement that there are two explanations for whyone can use the handlebars to lean a moving motorcycle. The question is,is one of the effect dominant, and which one is it? The idea would be todesign an experiment which would seaprate the two characteristics, andsee which effect produces a similar result to the one with which those ofus who have bikes are familiar.Let's look at the one that, so far, has sparked no controversy on itsown, gyroscopic precession. To examine this alone, we would have toget rid of the contact patch effect, by not allowing the contact patchesto transmit any force. The wheels and steering mechanism would have toremain, and be attached to a vehicle with about the same weight as a bike,through suspension (so that the wheels transmit forces to the bike thesame way) similar to a bikes. An experiment would be to ride a bike along a dry road to get moving and to get the wheels spinning, then change surfaces to something that won't transmit forces through the contact patches, and try a steering manoeuvre to see if the bike leans. It probably would, since some of us know how easy it is to fall down on ice, but we wouldn't get a good idea of how well or what it feels like because, without the contact patches, we can't turn.  Maybe there's a better way. Besides, even ice doesn't get rid of the contact patchforces altogether, so we'd have to find a really frictionless surface.You'd have to try it again with the wheels locked to really know if itwas the rotation that did it.Looking at the contact-patch effect only, however, is fairly simple.Now we have to find a vehicle that gets the about the same magnitude anddirection of cantact patch forces as a motorcycle, and transmits themabout the same way to the vehicle, but without rotating wheels.How it gets the contact patch forces is irrelevant, we're just lookingfor something that has contact patches that can go straight and notsideways, and skis or skates would do fine. I don't know of any snow-skior skate bikes, but up here we have the Suzuki Wetbike that is arrangedlike a motorcycle but has fat water skis where there should be wheels.I think the propellor is in front of the rear ski, or something likethat, but we could try it at a coast to get rid of most of its effect.Now I admit that this is second hand info (although I'd love to tryone of these), but the review in the local cycle rag and a guy ina bike shop that sells them both say that this machine handles verymuch like a motorcycle, in that you countersteer it to turn.So we have contact patches that transmit similar forces to a bike's,a similar suspension arrangement, and no gyroscopes, but we do havecountersteering.Conclusion: you don't need gyroscopes to countersteer vehicles that havemotorcycle-like contact patch arrangements. We still don't know whatreal effect the gyroscopes have when they're there, but from my observationsof how handlebar angle, force, etc. relate to steering in general, I'm willing to bet that they're not the dominant factor in countersteering. If you don't like this conclusion, then don't accept it, but my motorcycle'sbehaviour is consistent with it. If someone can prove otherwise, go ahead.I've        bike                      like       | Jody Levine  DoD #275 kV     got a       you can        if you      -PF  | Jody.P.Levine@hydro.on.ca                         ride it                 | Toronto, Ontario, Canada"	rec.motorcycles

Some have offered to intercede in negotiations,including a young man who will identify himself only as ""Bill"" andclaims to be the ""MS-iah"".Former members of the cult, some only recently deprogrammed, speakhesitantly of their former lives, including being forced to work20-hour days, and subsisting on Jolt and Twinkies.

In order to get the brick -wall, you need enough voltage gain on the current sensor.  Normally a darlington on the current sensing resistor will be adequate, but for infinite gain.. use an op amp to sense the current releative to a stable voltage reference and use a driver to turn off the base bias on the series-pass transistor.

The shocksensor is very sensitive, but much more practical than the motion sensor I haveon my other car.  It doesn't trigger if the car is rocked gently by the wind,but any kind of shock sets it off.  Even kicking the tire sets it off.  Itworks great.> > What worries me is the hood and hatch.  If someone could pry > them up gently enough, then they could bypass the alarm.The shock sensor is adjustable and there are two cycles on it.  You can adjustit to be sensitive enough that there is no way you could open the hood withoutsetting off the alarm.  Although, I know that you cannot pop the hood on theSyclone without setting off my alarm now, and yet I have had zero (none!) falsealarms with this system.  The alarm tells you when you disarm it whether it hasbeen activated in your absence.  I have been able to trace every alarm to it'scause and it was not a false alarm.> > I'm also wondering how easy it would be for a thief to crawl> underneath the car and cut the battery cable to disable the alarm.> I guess it would be possible depending on the vehicle.  My Syclone is so tightin the engine compartment that it would be tough to do this.  There aresupplemental power supplies you can put on with this Viper alarm, but I don'thave one.  I really think that if someone wants my car that bad, the alarmwon't keep them from it, even with a supplemental power supply.> Viper also sells some fancy field disturbance sensor that> supposedly detects people approcahing the car....> This is primarily for convertibles.  I have a convertible and have looked atthis feature in detail.  Alpine actually makes a better radar unit if you wantto get one of these.  It has zones in it that can be shut down independently sothat if one side of your car has pedestrian traffic or something else thatwould trigger an alarm, it shuts down the zone, or rather, pulls it in tighter.I don't see the real benefit to these unless you have a convertible that youleave the top down on.Avoid the voice alarm that can be added to the radar package.  It talks topeople as they walk by.  I saw one installed on a Lotus Esprit.  The kids wouldtaunt it seeing how close they could get before it 'warned' them to get back. The owner finally disabled it, which defeats the purpose in my mind.> > I'm interested in the opinions of you netters about these problems> and about the viper in general.> I am real happy with my Viper.  One other feature I really like is you can tuneit to your preferences.  You can have it arm passively or not.  You can disablethe chirp for arming/disarming.  You can have it lock/unlock the doors when thealarm is armed/disarmed.  I like these features.  I hate the chirp when the alarm arms/disarms, so mineflashes the lights only.  I like the door lock feature, although I have to becareful to take my keys with me because it doesn't know if you have left yourkeys in the car when it passively arms and locks the doors.  But, if you aremeticulous about taking your keys with you, it takes care of the rest.> The car is an 89 Ford Probe GT that used to be in great shape!> > > Ron Garnett> I looked seriously at the Alpine system too.  It is a real nice system, butmore money and it has a motion sensor standard instead of the shock sensor. The shock sensor is better....and the Viper shock sensor is better (2 cycle)than the optional Alpine one, IMHO.  I think the Viper gives you a lot of goodvalue for the money.  But it isn't absolutely tamperproof.  No system is. Except maybe the one that James Bond had on his Lotus in For Your Eyes Only. Anyone know where we can get one of those installed?

Ifyou are caught with one it will be confiscated on the spot and willnot be returned until after you appear in court and pay your fine. The fine for having a radar detector accessible in a motor vehicle(even if it is not on) is $250.00.  Sorry, tourist, ignorance ofthe law is no excuse - they will get you too!It used to be that the only way the law could be enforced was foran officer to actually see the radar detector.  Not any more!  Manylaw enforcement agencies are now using radar detector detectors. Right, a super sensitive receiver that is capable of picking up RFfrom the radar detector itself.  My first reaction was ""no way!"" But, guess again, these little buggers really work and the policeare writing citations right and left for people using radardetectors.  One news story quoted an officer as saying that he hadfound the radar detector in all of the cars he stopped except one,and he could never figure out where it was - but he knew it wasthere.  This tends to make one assume there are few false arrest.Now, before I get flamed, please understand that I do drive at ornear the speed limit.  I do not need a radar detector to keep mefrom getting a speeding ticket.  But, I do like to know when myspeed is being clocked or a speed trap is functioning.  My radardetector now stays locked in my trunk when I am in Virginia (whichis what they want - and yes, what the law says, and I intend toobey the law!) and is only used in states where it is legal.For my fellow hams, I am not a microwave person - my mind onlyworks in the HF spectrum between 10 and 80 meters.  Microwaveenlightment may be necessary.So, the questions are -  What do the radar detector detectors actually detect?  Would additional shielding/grounding/bypassing shield stray RF generated by  a radar detector, or is the RF actually being emitted by the detector  antenna?  Are any brands ""quieter"" than others?==============================================================================Randy T. Agee - ARS WB4BZX       | At some point, you probably pondered The P.O.

I am going absolutely INSANE.> I wanna know if the problem is MY Duo, or all Duo 210s, or all Duos,> or just me.> Hmmm... Sounds vaguely similar to a problem I had a long time ago when I was  trying to use Kermit.  I was building a serial connection between my Duo 210  and my NeXT.  I think the problem was in the handshaking.  Basically, you need  to make sure that the handshaking protocol is the same on both sides.  A safe  place to start is by selecting NO handshaking on either end.  One problem is  that the Zilog serial chip seems to get permanently wedged if you talk to it  wrong, and only a reset will clear it.  I don't know the specifics.  But this  could be a nonlinearity that screws up your attempts at debugging the system.   It could very well be that you are doing things right--eventually-- but one  wrong move (like trying a bad handshaking protocol) can screw up any further  correct actions, until the next machine reset.  I have wedged my Mac and also  my NeXT that way.Now I can send files back and forth between the Duo and the NeXT without any  problem, and at pretty high speeds too.I don't know what kind of chip the PC uses, but I think the Zilog 8530 is  pretty standard.Hope this helps,-Avery	comp.sys.mac.hardware

"Newsgroup:soc.religion.christianDocument_id: 21567From: Rick_Granberry@pts.mot.com (Rick Granberry)Subject: Boston C of CNote:  the following article is submitted on behalf of someone (Frank daniels) who has difficulty posting to s.r.c, email replies to daniels@math.ufl.edu	I am unable to post to the bitnet groups.	Here is a capsule history of the Shepherding/Discipleship Movement inthe Churches of Christ (i.e. Crossroads/Boston):	I could trace the Movement back as far as 1800, and indeed some of itsroots go back that far, but these were really ""influences"" on the Movement,and not the actual movement, per se.	I will start in c.1920.	In that day, there were 'white' churches and 'colored' churches innearly every area (due to segregation).  Modern Pentecostalism was developingas a predominantly 'colored' phenomenon.  Here, there was great fanaticism,emphasis on emotional experiences, and belief in a personal guidance andindwelling of the Holy Spirit.	Many 'white' Protestant churches were growing into what became knownas conservative fundamentalism.  By the 1940s, the evangelical movement wasin full swing, and many groups were becoming part of it.	When the civil rights movement grew stronger (in the 1950's and 1960's),many 'white' church groups began to be influenced by the 'black' churches andby what was going on there.  This spread started in the most liberal of groupsand spread to the more conservative ones by the late '60's.  In 1969, even theCatholic Church was displaying evidence of influence by the other groups...stillevident today.	The Churches of Christ are (and were) a very conservative Protestantgroup.  When the influence from outside began to reach the CofC in c.1965, itwas generally not appreciated.  Conservative groups are very strongly resistantto change, and the new movement was VERY different from the CofC status quo.	The magazines put out at that time by CofC folks tell the story as itunfolds.  New ideas came into the CofC.  There was a big push to reach out tocollege students, young adults, and teens.  Some called this the Campus Evangel-ism Movement.  Emotions, generally not highly regarded in the CofC at large,played a more important role in the new movement.  In some places, people beganto speak in tongues (as their Pentecostal predecessors did).	This was met with extreme criticism from within the Churches of Christ.In some places, people were fired from their jobs for speaking in tongues or foradvocating the ""Holy Spirit Movement"", another name for the new branch.  Theterm ""Underground Church of Christ"" also came into use because these people hadto hide their differences (or they might be ostricised).	There were several congregations, however, whose leaderships werereceptive to the new ideas (at least in part; the tongues-speaking never reallycaught on).  One of these was the 14th Street Church of Christ in Gainesville,FL.  Campus Ministry had already been regarded as important at 14th Street, andthe new ideas seemed to be very helpful tools for evangelism.  They also seemedto put vitality into the church, which many felt had been lacking.	In October of 1967, the 14th Street congregation hired Chuck Lucas tobe its Campus Minister.  By 1970, he would move to being the congregation's(lead) Minister.  In the late 60's/early 70's, the congregation worked with manyother groups.  They held Bible discussions at Daytona Beach during Spring Break.They organized talks in the fraternities on the University of Florida campus.They also worked with UF sports people.	In 1972, the congregation ordered a larger building to be constructed.When it was finished, the group moved and changed its name (now no longerappropriate).  It became the Crossroads Church of Christ from then on, a namethat would become legendary.	By this time, Crossroads was basically the only CofC whose programswere fully aligned to the new movement.  While they didn't start it, they continued it and were responsible for where it wound up going.	By 1975, none of the other Churches of Christ in the area felt thatthey could cooperate with Crossroads, due to what they recognized as doctrinalproblems at Crossroads.	Crossroads had begun to heavily emphasize, and later require attendanceat all church functions.  It was seen as a good thing for each member to haveat least one close relationship, a person with whom you would share all ofyour problems, pray, and get help from.  The concept was called Prayer Partners,which later became Discipleship Partners and also later became mandatory.  Theleadership was assigning prayer partners to people for a while.	The book called ""The Master Plan of Evangelism"" was a strong influenceon Chuck Lucas.  He (and the group) believed that it was every person's dutyand life purpose to carry out the great commission.  Crossroads was growingin number, and numbers became VERY important (some would say all-important).	A person who ""was evangelistic"" was ""spiritual"".  Evangelism meantinviting people to Crossroads events; if you did this a lot and some of themconverted, then you were ""spiritual"".  There were sermons about how if youbought groceries, the cashier and bag boy ought to receive invitations toservices.  Everyone at your job ought to receive invitations.  Since thesepeople needed Jesus, you should be ""aggressive""--don't take 'no' for ananswer.	If you did not evangelize enough, you came to be called ""lazy"" or""unspiritual"".	By the end of the decade, the Prayer Partner system was integrated intoa structure.  The Elders and Ministers were on top (like a big pyramid).  Thenthe group leaders, Bible study leaders, and members.  Everyone who came in hadsomeone placed over them.	It is at this time, 1978-1980, that the bad press about Crossroadsbegan to circulate.  The problem with rape on the University of Florida campuswas tremendous, but Crossroads was considered a bigger and more immediateproblem.  There were many complaints about the congregation and its ""pushy""evangelistic tactics.  Crossroads was considering the other Churches of Christto be ""dead"" churches, which aggravated them; it was aggressively recruitingout of the other church groups (denominations), which aggravated THEM.	By this time, Crossroads had grown numerically to the point (1100)where not only did they believe that they would soon need a new building, butalso they were sending out ""planting"" [create a new church] and ""reconstructing""[reorganize an existing church] teams to other cities.  By this time, theCrossroads Movement was underway.	A group was sent to the 30-member Lexington Church of Christ in Boston,MA.  The team was headed up by Kip McKean, who had been converted out of afraternity by Crossroads (in Gainesville).  Kip held a still stronger view ofchurch authority, which he believed was heavily vested in the Evangelist(s),and not so much in the Elders.  He had been fired in 1977 from the congregationthat he had been working at when the elders there found numerous things wrongwith his theology, including the practice of what came to be called one-over-oneChristianity.  [Called this by critics]	In the first year, half of the 30 people felt that they did not want tobe a part of the new congregation.  They left.  But others began coming intothe new Boston Church of Christ.	Ah, but I'm ahead of myself.	At Crossroads, the heavy-handed system had begun to take its toll onthe members.  Many have said that they felt that they were working hard, butthey were not achieving the results that were so important.  The numbers weredropping.  From 1978, Crossroads membership declined steadily.  The leadershipbegan to tighten the reigns on the congregation, who was seen as being largely""unproductive"" and ""unfruitful"".  The ""fruit"" passages in the NT were interpretedas referring to new converts.  If you were not bearing fruit, said John 15, youwould be cast into the fire!  [Boston still teaches this.]	If you love your neighbor, you'll save his soul (invite him to churchand convert him).  If you're not doing that, you don't love your neighbor.And if you don't love, you're in danger of backsliding.  The logical argumentscontinue in this vein.	In 1985, Chuck Lucas was fired from his job as minister, due to recurringsins in his life.  These struggles were never revealed to the congregation atlarge, although many people outside the congregation had heard about them.  Forby now, there was very little contact (on a friendship level) between mostCrossroads members and those outside.  [If you have contact, your focus shouldbe on converting them.  Bring them to a Bible Study.]	Chuck's replacement was Joe Woods, who was fully supportive of theBoston system.  As Boston grew in number, they began to offer 'training' sessionsfor other ministers.  Joe went to Boston to be trained and returned to Cross-roads ready to emphasize the ""total commitment"" to the church that Boston andKip McKean were now emphasizing.  Eventually, in Fall of 1987, the Elders at Crossroads (now 2 in number--Dick Whitehead and Bill Hogle) made a decision.Boston was demanding that all of the other churches in the movement come underthe direction of the church in Boston.  The Elders refused, citing their beliefthat each church should be autonomous (something true in all non-Boston Churchesof Christ).  Perhaps there was also some degree of offense done here, sinceCrossroads was no longer the 'example' to the rest of the Movement.  The groupnow numbered about 800, while Boston was now larger (in membership).	The Churches of Christ generally teach that baptism is a necessaryelement of salvation.  At Crossroads, they taught what was called 'Lordship'baptism:  you had to understand the commitment involved before you could bebaptized.  You had to 'count the cost'.  At Boston, they took this a stepfurther.  If at some time you became ""unproductive"", then your spiritualitywas suspect.  People would begin to ask you if you REALLY understood what youwere getting into.  Anyone who said 'no' had their baptism deemed invalid:  theyhadn't counted the cost properly.  They still had to be baptized.  Others calledthis ""rebaptism"", and Crossroads didn't approve of this practice.	When Crossroads announced that it would not follow Boston, many of itsmembers left Crossroads and went to Movement-related ministries, which werenow called Discipling Ministries.  You were either discipling (evangelizing) oryou were ""dead"".  They also used the nickname ""Movement of God"" for a while.	By Summer of 1988, Crossroads was withdrawn from the Movement and nowstood alone.  They had few to no allies in the mainstream Churches of Christ,and now none in the Movement.	Boston, however, continued to chart its course in the direction thatthey had been following.  They sent ""reconstruction teams"" to many cities, whichusually meant that they split the church there.  They stopped acknowledging otherchurches of Christ as Christians and began to call themselves the ""remnant"".The ""remnant"" of the Jews in the OT are those who are saved by God.  It wasfelt that the ""remnant"" today represents all the Christians.  Sometimes theywould simply call their Movement ""the church"".	They usually took the name of the city for their name, implying to theother Churches of Christ that Boston did not recognize their existence.  Manycampuses have now formally forbidden Boston ministries from recruiting theredue to the number of complaints.  In some cases, it has been documented thatBoston ministries have lied to University officials in order to continue to haveaccess to the campus.  Any resistance that they experience is termed ""perse-cution"", which all true Christians are expected to experience.  Are you reallya Christian if you're not being persecuted?	The numbers at Boston peaked at c.3000 in 1989.  Since then, they havefought to remain steady.  I have heard a tape of Kip McKean shouting at theleaders for failing to fulfill the Great Commission (their life's purpose) asGod commanded them.  Their Christianity is highly centered on commands andobedience.	Crossroads once was called a cult.  Boston is now recognized by theCult Awareness Network and other national and international groups as a cult,under a formal definition, because of the techniques which they employ.  Theterm ""cult"" is usually differentiated from ""sect"" by the practice of thosetechniques.  The techniques which they employ are recognized by many as beingtechniques of destructive pursuasion, also used by other ShepherdingDiscipleship groups.  [Robert Jay Lifton, Margaret Thaler Singer, and manyothers have written about the topic.]  These techniques include guilt motivation,emotional manipulation, loaded language, the aura of sacred science (a sortof mystic element seen in everyday events), and others.	I have no particular axe to grind against the Movement.  I have numer-ous friends who are still part of the Movement.  I have never had a 'fallingout' with anyone in the Movement.  I disagree with many things which they teach.I recognize the psychological damage done by being involved in such a system.I hold no loyalty to the mainstream Churches of Christ and do not defend theirmistakes either.	I want to point out, though, that unlike in many other systems whichare in other ways similar, the Leadership of the Boston Movement are as muchvictims of the system as the members.  We do not have a leader who enjoysmanipulating his people.  The leaders believe what they teach, and they feelaccountable for the activites (and spiritual welfare) of the members.  Whenmembers do not evangelize to their expectations, for example, the leaders feelpersonally responsible as well.  The leaders are not out for money or power.They want to evangelize the world in their lifetime.	I have said too much, but there is much more to say.  There are manyexamples I could give and quotes from other sources (including Boston bulletins)that I could include.  But this is too long already.  You may post this ifyou so desire.

Here is everything that you would ever want to know about PMS.Premenstrual syndrome has been divided into four specific subgroups:	PMT-A(Anxiety)		PMT-D(depression)	anxiety			depression	irritability		forgetfulness	insomnia		confusion	depression		lethargy	PMT-C(Craving)		PMT-H(Hyperhydration)	craving for sweets	weight gain	increased appetite	breast congestion and tenderness	sugar ingestion causes: abdominal bloating and tenderness	 1. headache		edema of the face and extremities	 2. palpitations	 3. fatigue or fainting PMT-A is characterized by elevated blood estrogen levels and low progesterone levels during the luteal phase of a women's cycle.PMT-C is caused by the ingestion of large amounts of refined simple carbohydrates.  During the luteal phase of a women's cycle, there is increased glucose tolerance with a flat glucose curve after oral glucose challenge.  The metabolic findings believed to be responsible for PMT-C are a low magnesium and a low prostaglandin E1.  This condition of hypoglycemia is not unique to PMS but there are a number of different causes of hypoglycemia, magnesium and PGE1 seem to be specific to PMS hypoglycemia.	A. Am. J. Psychiatry 147(4):477-80(1990).Unrefined complex carbohydrate should be substituted for sugar, magnesium supplementation and alpha linoleic acid supplementation(increased to 5-6% of the total calories) using safflower oil or evening primrose oil as sources of alpha linoleic acid.PMT-D is characterized by elevated progesterone levels during the midluteal phase of a women's cycle.  Another cause of PMT-D has been found to be lead toxicity(in women without elevated progesterone levels during the midluteal phase). ""Effect of metal ions on the binding of estridol to human endometrial cystol"" Fertil. Steril. 28:312-18(1972).PMT-H is associated with water and salt retention along with an elevated serum aldosterone level.  Salt restriction, B6, magnesium and vitamin E for breast tenderness have all been effective in treating PMT-HThis general discussion of the PMS syndromes came form:	A. ""Management of the premenstrual tension sundromes: Rational for 	    a nutritional approach"". 1986, A Year in Nutritional Medicine. 	    J. Bland, Ed. Keats, Publishing, 1986.	B. ""Nutritional factors in the etiology of premenstrual tension 	    syndromes"", J. Reprod. Med.28(7):446-64(1983).	C. ""Premenstrual tension"", Prob. Obstet. Gynecol. 3(12):1-39(1980)Treatment has traditionally involved progesterone administration if you can find a doctor who will treat you for PMS(just about as hard as finding one that will treat you for candida blooms).  While progesterone will work, supplementation with vitamins and minerals works even better.  There really has been an awful lot of research done on PMS(much more than candida blooms).  Many of these studies have been what are called experimental controlled studies(the type of rigorous clinical studies that doctors like to see done).Here are a few of these studies:	CARBOHYDRATE: Experimental Controlled Study, ""Effect of a low-fat, 	high-carbohydrate diet on symptoms of cyclical mastopathy"" Lancet 	2:128-32(1988).  21 pts with severe persistent cyclical mastopathy 	of at least 5 years duration were randomly selected to receive 	specific training to reduce dietary fat to 15% of total calories 	and increase complex carbohydrate ingestion or given general dietary 	advise with no training.  After 6 months, there was a significant 	reduction in the severity of the breast swelling and tenderness in 	the trained group as reported by self-reported symptoms as well as 	physical exams which quantitated the degree of breast swelling, 	tenderness and nodularity.	VITAMIN A: Experimental Controlled Study, ""The use of Vitamin A in 	premenstrual tension"" Acta Obstet. Gynecol Scand. 39:586-92(1960).  	218 pts with severe recurring PMS received 200,000 to 300,000IU 	vitamin A daily or a placebo.  Serum retinol levels were monitored 	and high dose supplementation was discontinued when evidence of 	toxicity occured(serum retinol above 450ug/ml).  The intent of the 	study was to load the liver up with vitamin A and get a normal pool 	size(500,000IU to 1,000,000IU) and then see if this 	normal vitamin A pool could prevent PMS.  48% getting the high dose 	vitamin A had complete remission of the symptoms of PMS.  Only 10% 	getting the placebo reported getting complete relief of PMS sysmptoms.  	10% of the vitamin A treated group reported no improvement in PMS 	symptoms.	Experimental Controlled Study, ""Premenstrual tension treated with 	vitamin A"" J. Clinical Endocrinology 10:1579-89(1950). 30 pts 	received 200,000IU of vitamin A daily starting on day 15 of their 	cycle with supplementation continuing until the onset of PMS symptoms.  	After 2-6 months, all 30 pts reported a significant improvement in 	PMS symptoms.  Vitamin A supplementation was stopped once evidence of 	toxicity was demonstrated and all 30 pts were followed for one year 	after high dose vitamin A supplementation was stopped.  PMS symptoms 	did not reoccur in any of these 30 pts for upto one year after the 	vitamin A supplementation was stopped.Most Americans do not have a normal store of vitamin A in their liver.  These studies and several others were designed to see if getting a normal store of vitamin A into the liver could eliminate PMS.  Of all the vitamins given for PMS(vitamin A, B6, and vitamin E), vitamin A has shown the best single effect.  This is probably because vitamin A is involved in steroid (estrogen/progesterone) metabolism in the liver.  Getting your liver full of vitamin A seems to be one of the best things that you can do to prevent the symptoms of PMS.  But vitamin A is toxic and you don't want to be trying to do this without being seen by a physician who can monitor you for vitamin A toxicity.	VITAMIN B6: Experimental Double-blind Crossoverr Study, ""Pyridoxine	(vitamin B6) and the premenstrual syndrome: A randomized crossover 	trial""J.R. Coll. Gen. Pract. 39:364-68(1989).  32 women aged 18-49 	with moderate to severe PMS randomly received 50mg B6 daily or placebo.  	After 3 months the groups were switched and followed for another 	3 months.  B6 had a significant effect on the emotional aspects of 	PMS(depression, irritability and tiredness).  Other symptoms of PMS 	were not significanttly affected by B6 supplementation.	Experimental Double-blind Study, ""The efects of vitamin B6 	supplementation on premenstrual sysmptoms"" Obstet. Gynecol 	70(2):145-49(1987).  55 pts with moderate to severe PMS received 	150mg B6 daily or placebo for 2 months.  Analysis of convergence 	showed that B6 significantly improved premenstrual symptoms related 	to the autonomic nervous system(dizziness and vomiting) as well as 	behavior changes(poor mental performance, decreased social interaction)  	Anxiety, depression and water retention were not improved by B6 	supplementation.Vitamin B6 is below the RDA for both American men and women.  Birth control pills and over 40 different drugs increase the B6 requirement in man.  Women on birth control pills should be supplemented with 10-15 mg of B6 per day.  The dose should be increased if symptoms of PMS appear.  Dr. David R. Rubinow who heads the biological psychiatry branch of NIMH was quoted in Clin. Psychiatry News, December, 1987 as stating that B6 should be considered the ""first-line"" drug for PMS(over progesterone) and if the patient does not respond, then other treatments should be tried.  Vitamin B6 can be toxic(nerve damage) if consumed in doses of 500mg or more each day. 	VITAMIN E: Experimental Double-blind Study, ""Efficacy of alpha-	tocopherol in the treatment of premenstrual syndrome"" J. Reprod. 	Med. 32(6):400-04(1987). 35 pts received 400IU vitamin E daily for 3 	cycles or a placebo.  Vitamin E treated pts had 33% who reported a 	significant reduction in physical symptoms(weight gain and breast 	tenderness) while the placebo group had 14% who reported a significant 	reduction in physical symptoms. The vitamin E group reported that 38% 	had a significant reduction in anxiety versus 12% for the placebo 	group.  For depression, the vitamin E group had 27% with a significant	decrease in depression compared with 8% for the placebo group.	Experimental Double-blind Study, ""The effect of alpha-tocopherol on 	premenstrual symptomalogy: A double blind study"" J. Am. Coll. Nutr. 	2(2):115-122(1983). 75pts with benign breast disease and PMT randomly 	received vitamin E at 75IU, 150IU, or 300IU daily or placebo.  After 	2 months of supplementation, 150IU of vitamin E or higher significantly 	improved PMT-A and PMT-C.  The 300IU dose was needed to significantly 	improve PMT-D.  No dose of vitamin E significantly improved PMT-H	(other studies have shown that a higher vitamin E doses will relieve 	PMT-H symptoms).		MAGNESIUM: Experimental Double-blind Study, ""Magnesium prophylaxis 	of menstrual migraine: effects on itracellular magnesium"" Headache 	31:298-304(1991). 20 pts with perimenstrual headache received 360 mg 	daily of magnesium as magnesium pyrrolidone carboxylic acid or a 	placebo.  Treatment was started on the 15th day of the cycle and 	continued until menstruation. After 2 months, the Pain Total Index 	was significantly lower in the magnesium group.  Magnesium treatment 	was also assocoiated with a significant reduction in the Menstrual 	Distress Questionnaire scores.  Pretreatment magnesium levels in  	lymphocytes and polymorphonuclear leukocytes were significantly lower 	in this group of 20 pts compared to control women who did not suffer 	from PMS.  After treatment, magnesium levels in these cells was raised 	into the normal range.	Experimental Double-blind Study, ""Oral Magnesium successfully 	relieves premenstrual mood changes"" Obstet. Gynecol 78(2):177-81(1991). 	32pts aged 24-39 randomly received either magnesium carboxylic acid 	360mg of Mg per day or a placebo from the 15th day of the cycle to the 	onset of the menstrual flow.  After 2 cycles, both groups received 	magnesium.  The Menstrual Distress Questionnaire score of the cluster 	pain was significantly reduced during the second cycle(month) for the 	magnesium treatment group as well as the placebo group once they were 	switched to magnesium supplementation.  In addition, the total score on 	the Menstrual Distress Questionnaire was significantly decreased by 	magnesium supplementation.  The authors suggest that magnesium 	supplemenation should become a routine treatment for the mood changes 	that occur during PMS.There are numerous observational studies that have been published in the medical literature which also suggest that PMS is primarily a disorder that arises out of a hormone imbalance that is dietary in nature.  But since observational studies are considered by most physicians in Sci. Med. to be anecdotal in nature, I have not bothered to cite them.  There are also over a half dozen good experimental studies that have been done on multivitamin and mineral supplementation to prevent PMS.  I've chosen the best specific studies on individual vitamins and minerals to try to point out that PMS is primarily a nutritional disorder.  But doctors don't recognize nutritional disorders unless they can see clinical pathology(beri-beri, pellagra, scruvy, etc.).  PMS is probably the best reason why every doctor being trained in the U.S. should get a good course on human nutrition.  PMS is really only the tip if the iceberg when it comes to nutritional disorders.  It's time that medicine woke up and smelled the roses.Here's some studies which show the importance in multivitamin/mineral supplementation and/or diet change in preventing PMS.	Experimental Study, ""Effect of a nutritional programme on 	premenstrual syndrome: a retrospective analysis"", Complement. Med. 	Res.5(1):8-11(1991).  200pts were given dietary instructions and 	supplemented with Optivite(R) plus additional vitamin C, vitamin E, 	magnesium, zinc and primrose oil.  The dietary instructions were to 	take the supplements and switch to a low fat, complex carbohydrate 	diet.  On a retrospective analysis, 96.5% of the 200pts reported an 	improvement in their PMS symptoms with 30% of the sample stating that 	they no longer suffered from PMS. 	Experimental Double-blind Study, ""Role of Nutrition in managing 	premenstrual tension syndromes"", J Reprod. Med. 32(6):405-22(1987).  	A low fat, high complex carbohydrate diet along with Optivite 	supplementation significantly decreased PMS scores compared with diet 	change and placebo.  After 6 months on the experimental program, the 	vitamin/mineral supplementated group had significantly decreased 	estradiol and increased progesterone in serum during the midlutel 	phase of their cycle.	Experimental Double-blind Study, ""Clinical and biochemical effects 	of nutritional supplementation on the premenstrual syndrome"", J. 	Reprod. Med. 32(6):435-41(1987). 119pts randomly given Optivite(12 	tablets per day) or a placebo.  The treated groups showed a 	significant decrease in PMS symptoms compared to the placebo.  Another 	group of 104pts got Optivite(4 tablets per day) or placebo.  For this 	second group of patients, no significant effect of supplementation on 	PMS symptoms was observed.Martin Banschbach, Ph.D.Professor of Biochemistry and ChairmanDepartment of Biochemistry and MicrobiologyOSU College of Osteopathic Medicine1111 W. 17th St.Tulsa, Ok 74107""Without discourse, there is no remembering, without remembering, there is no learning, without learning, there is only ignorance"""	sci.med

Isit because too many people take French and German in college to makethe accusations stick? (-;) was to preserve the doctors independance.Since the provincial wings of the CMA are the ones that go to bat whenthe fee schedule hikes are presented, the politically-bent doctorswere just cackling when they realized the CMA would grow in strengthrather than diminish, especially when unopposed unlike in socializedmedicine approaches like Britain's National Health Service.>""`You've got to remember, you've got a waiting list as well, but it's  >not as obvious.

For non-life threatening things, market arguments adequately cover whycertain procedures are in scarcer demand.  I have MD friends who can'tmake a living as specialists back in Manitoba not due to the insurancerates but because they won't get enough customers -- the CMA medicalmonopoly's grip on doctors licencing (as in the US) aside -- so theymust move to larger places.  However, this does not refute debunkingof waiting lines for urgent AND routine care, as has been done in theU.S. by Consumers Reports, health policy studies cited by Prof. DennisE. Shea on USENET, CNN, NYT, etc.Doug Fierro has posted a NYT article from 3 weeks ago about Canada'shealth insurance approach, on Talk.politics.medicine.  There is onesmall error in the article: not all of our hospitals are private.>WOULDN'T NATIONAL HEALTH INSURANCE MEAN THAT AMERICANS WHO ARE NOW  >FULLY INSURED MIGHT HAVE TO SETTLE FOR LESS?  >>In Canada, provincial insurance covers all health costs except dental  >care, eyeglasses, prescription drugs, ambulance service, and private  >hospital rooms, -- so many Canadians do end up buying some private  >insurance. A policy to cover all of these things runs about #40 to $40  >a month.  Of course, the one thing to note is that in the Canada/France/Germanycase, private insurance *offloaded* the basic coverage to the publicsector.  They realized they were keeping low-risk/high-profit extrainsurance for things like private/semi-private rooms (vs. wardaccomodation), dental, glasses, etc. for corporate or personalbenefits, they'll have nothing to do with you if you want to becovered for basic care.At that point, they wouldn't even consider a ""voucher"" approachto broker the universal coverage and sell policies to make upthe difference in the federal guidelines and market stuff.>******************************************************************  >>WOULDN'T FREE CARE ENCOURAGE PEOPLE TO RUN TO THE DOCTOR FOR EVERY  >ACHE AND PAIN?  >>People who get free treatment *do* go to the doctor and hospital about  >a third more often than those who have to pay a share of their medical  >bills.  >>Still, Canadians -- who pay nothing at the doctor's -- have a lower  >per-person health bill than we do.It is ""free"" in that there are no deductibles nor copayments (twothings which I advocate to make the Canadian insurance look more likereal health insurance -- which actually it is).  I know that whenworking in Alberta, Ontario and Quebec, I was aware that I was payingfor health insurance - e.g., in Toronto, OHIP fees were listed on mypay stub; Manitoba did not collect at paycheque time, but onlyannually at income tax time (built into the tax rate).  Only fiscalnaifs will proclaim that it's free, along with the Canadian Left forthat is part of their brainwashing agenda.The French do have copayments, though.  France Magazine's Summer 1992 edition has a fantastic presentation of their basic insurancecoverage, including a sample chart of copayment percentages.  For 1-30 days, you're covered for 80% of the public hospital rate, 100%afterward.  With extra private insurance, you can get into a privatehospital and be covered for any differences beyond the public hospitalrate.  The public insurance covers 100% beyond 30 days, or the samecash amount for a private hospital and the difference is paidout-of-pocket or according to your supplementary private insurance.Over 2/3rds of French have some form of extra private insurance.  So,the other 30% of health costs in Europe are out of private funds, notgleaned from other taxes.  The GDP figures are combined public andprivate expenditures for total outlay using the same methods thatyield the 13-14% figure for the U.S.>ISN'T THE PRIVATE HEALTH INSURANCE INDUSTRY JUST TOO BIG  >AND POWERFUL TO KILL?  >>Dismantling the health segment of our insurance industry would be  >""politically thorny,"" in the quiet words of one advocate for a  >national plan.

You can opt out in Canadaand Germany, but you'll have to go uninsured as a result becausethere are too few other people that do so --- i.e., no market.When private insurance realized how much money they'd make without therisks involved in basic insurance (e.g., neurosurgery) versus deluxeamenities (e.g., having to call Granada TV to replace a rental set onthe fritz in someone's private hospital room), they started to patthemselves on the back for their social responsibility.  In Quebeclast spring, a consortium of private insurers publicly warned againstany thoughts of privatizing routine, low cost parts of that province'spublic health insurance plan.gld--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Je me souviens ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Gary L.

"Newsgroup:talk.politics.miscdocument_id: 178574From: kennejs@a.cs.okstate.edu (KENNEDY JAMES SCOT)Subject: We're winning the war on drugs.  Not!The DEA and other organizations would have the American peoplebelieve that we are winning the ""war on drugs"".  I'm going todispel the propaganda that the DEA is putting out by showingyou the drug war's *real* status. To help prove my assertionsI've also posted two articles from USA Today that clearlydemonstrate that drug use among certain age groups *is* on therise.  If WOD is working, as we're led to believe, then drugabuse should have gone down substantially by now.  The realityis, is that it has not gone down very much.  If anything,substance abuse is on the rise.  I'm also going to supply apossible solution to this problem.The following text is an excerpt from an article about rock musicand pot entitled ""Hello Again, Mary Jane"" which appears in thecurrent issue of Time magazine (April 19, 1993, p. 59).    Law-enforcement officials say pot advocates are just blowing    smoke when they talk about the comeback of the weed.  ""Perhaps    because of the change of administrations, the marijuana lobby    is out in full force,"" says Robert Bonner, head of the Drug    Enforcement Administration.  ""The fact is, they're losing the    battle.""  In 1985 more than 23% of youths ages 12 to 17 said    they smoked marijuana; in 1991 that figure was 13%, and Bonner    says it is still falling.  Bonner also offers a reminder that    studies confirm such marijuana health risks as destruction of    nerve cells in the brain and lung damage.The chart that follows was taken from the Wednesday, April 14, 1993issue of USA Today (""Drug Use Up Among U.S. Eigth-graders"" by MikeSnider, p. 6D).    Adolescents' choices    Drugs used by eighth graders in the last month:                      Estimated, per 100 students                             1991     1992   Pct. chg.

I think you can see that oneof the tactics that the DEA employs to give people the impression thatthe ""war on drugs"" is being won is to selectively quote statistics---only statistics that support their contention that drug use has gonedown.  The excerpt from Time magazine that I included in this post isan excellent example of how organizations like the DEA attempt todeceive the public.Usage of *one* particular drug may have gone down but at the sametime usage of other drugs may have gone *up* (a.k.a. substitution).Also, drug usage among *one* particular age group may have gone downbut drug usage among another age group may have gone *up*.  Therefore,if one takes a look at the big picture, taking into consideration *all*the statistics, then it's obvious that the so-called ""war on drugs"" isbeing lost.  Perhaps the drug war is being won as far as illegal drugsgo, but if one factors in alcohol abuse, smoking, and use of inhalants,then the magnitude of the drug problem in this country can then placedin its true perspective.For those of you who don't consider alcohol to be a drug then trydrinking a fifth of whiskey sometime and then come back and tell methat it's not a drug.  Agencies like the DEA only go after *illegal*drugs.  This is one of the reasons why the drug war is a fruitlessattempt at preventing substance abuse---people will merely switch toanother drug if the one they were using becomes scarce or unpopular.The solution to the drug abuse problem in this country may be tolegalize some---not all---drugs whose toxicity has been shown to bewithin reasonable limits (you won't drop dead after using it a fewtimes) and then couple this with a massive drug education program.The reason why I think legalization is *part* of the solution isbecause people seem to be able to easily obtain drugs despite thegovernment's efforts to the contrary---the money spent on druginterdiction could be spent more effectively elsewhere (e.g., drugeducation).  Additionally, legalization would reduce crime becausethe profit motive would be taken out of drug trafficking which oftengoes along with other kinds of crime.  Not to mention the fact thataddicts would have less reason to prey on innocent people for theirmoney and posessions in order to support their expensive habit;legalization would cause the street price of drugs to fallsubstantially so drugs would be much more affordable to addicts.IMHO, the way to reduce substance abuse is to do to drugs what has beendone to smokers:  make drug use socially unacceptable rather than try toemploy heavy-handed law enforcement and punish people by incarceratingthem.  As you already know, people in the U.S. smoke a lot less thanthey used to.  This reduction in the number of smokers has been broughtabout by public awareness campaigns, laws restricting where people canlight up, warning labels on cigarette packages, taxation on tobacco inorder to reduce consumption, and so on.  I propose that similar methodsbe used to reduce substance abuse after legalization has been carriedout.  They are as follows:    * Drugs being sold must come with clear, concise information which      states the possible health hazzards involved with using this      product and recommendations on how the drug should be used.      Things like dosage levels and how long the drug should be used      ought to accompany the packaging the drug is contained in.    * All drugs should be taxed at a rate that generates a lot of      revenue but not so high as to encourage people to acquire drugs      through illegal channels.  Part of the revenue collected from      drug taxes should be used to fund drug education and law      enforcement.    * Make it a felony to sell drugs to minors (people under the age of      18).  Anyone can sell drugs but they must not dodge paying the      taxes on drugs or sell drugs with the warning information absent.      Failure to pay the appropiate taxes on drugs or omitting warning      information should also be a felony.    * Establish a government agency whose job is to insure that the      purity and safety of all drugs is as high as possible.  This      agency would try to prevent people from getting a hold of bad      drugs---something that is a fairly serious problem now.I'm sure that many of the things I've discussed in this article havebeen hashed out before in this newsgroup.  Nevertheless, I thoughtit was a good idea to give my two cents (actually a buck and a half...)all at once so you could get a good idea of where I currently stand onWOD.  Go ahead and tear into my post; I'm sure there is something in itthat you may wish to take a different view on or flame. :) :) :)  BTW,I posted the articles from USA Today to not only help prove myassertions but also to provide information on LSD usage among youths---something which I noticed some posters to this group were interested in.Scott Kennedy,  Brewer and PatriotBefore:  ""David Koresh is a cheap thug who interprets          the Bible through the barrel of a gun...""  --ATF spokesmanAfter:   ""[The ATF] is a cheap thug who interprets          [the Constitution] through the barrel of a gun...""  --Me"	talk.politics.misc

Jagr did not have a better season than     Francis ... to suggest otherwise is an insult to those with a modicum of     hockey knowledge.  Save your almost maniacal devotion to the almighty     plus/minus ... it is the most misleading hockey stat available.     Until the NHL publishes a more useful quantifiable statistic including ice     time per game and some measure of its ""quality"" (i.e., is the player put out     in key situations like protecting a lead late in the game; is he matched up     against the other team's top one or two lines; short-handed, etc), I would     much rather see the +/- disappear altogether instead of having its dubious     merits trumpeted by those with little understanding of its implications.Thank you for posting this.  As the person who first brought up thefact that Jagr has a much higher +/- than Francis, I can assure youthat I brought it up as an example of the absurdity of +/-comparisons, even on the same team.  I never, ever thought that anyonewould argue that Jagr's higher +/- actually reflected better two-wayplay.In my opinion, Francis's low +/- is purely a result of him being askedto play against opponents top scorers at all times; the fact that hecan chip in 100 points while neutralizing the other team's top centeris a testament to how valuable he is, even if his +/- suffers.  On theother hand, Jagr, for how big, fast and skilled he is, can't even get90 points, no matter how inflated his +/- is.(By the way, don't get me wrong -- I like Jagr.  He may be a lazyfloater, but he turns it on at exactly the right times -- likeovertime of playoff games).--Roland Dreier                                        dreier@math.berkeley.edu"	rec.sport.hockey

I find that I am dissatisfied with the little purposes that we canmanufacture for ourselves.  Little in the cosmic sense.  Even thegreatest of the great pharos are long gone, the pyramids historicaloddities being worn down by the wind, eventually to be turned into dust.Mankind itself will one day perish.  Without some interconnectednessthat transcends the physical, without God, it is all pointless in theend.  Most people are able to live with that, and for them littlepurposes (success, money, power, effecting change, helping others)suffice.  I suppose they never  think about the cosmic scale, or are atleast able to put it out of their minds.To me, it is comforting to know that reality is an illusion.  That thetrue reality underneath the the physical is spirit.  That this world isa school of sorts, where we learn and grow, and our souls mature.  Thatgives a purpose to my little purposes, and takes some of the pressureoff.  It's not so necessary to make this life a success in human termsif you're really just here to learn.  It's more important to progress,grow, persist, to learn to love yourself and others and to express yourlove, especially when it's dificult to do so.

"Newsgroup:rec.sport.hockeydocument_id: 52589From: rauser@fraser.sfu.ca (Richard John Rauser)Subject: Too Many Europeans in NHL   Ten years ago, the number of Europeans in the NHL was roughly a quarterof what it is now. Going into the 1992/93 season, the numbers of Euros onNHL teams have escalated to the following stats:Canadians: 400Americans: 100Europeans: 100   Please note that these numbers are rounded off, and taken from the top25 players on each of the 24 teams. My source is the Vancouver Sun.   Here's the point: there are far too many Europeans in the NHL. I am sickof watching a game between an American and a Canadian team (let's say, theRed Wings and the Canucks) and seeing names like ""Bure"" ""Konstantinov"" and""Borshevshky"". Is this North America or isn't it? Toronto, Detriot, Quebec,and Edmonton are particularly annoying, but the numbers of Euros on otherteams is getting worse as well.     I live in Vancouver and if I hear one more word about ""Pavel Bure, theRussian Rocket"" I will completely throw up. As it is now, every time I seethe Canucks play I keep hoping someone will cross-check Bure into the plexiglassso hard they have to carry him out on a stretcher. (By the way, I'm not aCanucks fan to begin with ;-).     Okay, the stretcher remark was a little carried away. But the point is thatI resent NHL owners drafting all these Europeans INSTEAD of Canadians (andsome Americans). It denies young Canadians the opportunity to play in THEIRNORTH AMERICAN LEAGUE and instead gives it to Europeans, who aren't evenbetter hockey players. It's all hype. This ""European mystique"" is sickening,but until NHL owners get over it, Canadian and American players will continueto have to fight harder to get drafted into their own league.    With the numbers of Euros in the NHL escalating, the problem is clearlyonly getting worse.

First of all, this is NOT a strife; this is a massacre of innocent	Moslem poeples by the Christian West.	Since Ottoman lost the control of Balkans, many tens and hundereds	of millions of Muslem peoples (Turks, Albanians, Bosnians, and others) 	have been tortured, raped, massacred, and driven out of their homes	by the Cristians of both the region and Europe. Some lucky ones 	escaped to relative safety in Turkiye. The remaining others are being 	finished now by local Christians, the USA, and the rest of Europe.	The Christian West is maintaining a tight arms ambargo on the Muslem	peoples of Bosnia so they cannot deffend themslves while letting 	Christian Serbs and Croats torture, rape, and massacre the innocent 	Moslem peoples of Bosnia.	It took Christian Europe for almost six centuries to achieve this	objective of theirs and I do not think they will let it up. This will 	go on untill every single Moslem person (Bosnian, Turk, Albanian, etc)	is tortured, raped, massacred, and driven out of their homes."	talk.politics.mideast

There's documentation on how to use the shared memory extension in theX11R5 distribution.  Actually, I just finished writing a motif animation program...(take-lots-of-image-data-and-display-it-pretty-darn-fast). When usingon-server pixmaps or shared memory, I had to insert a delay loop to keepit from going too quickly :). Testing both methods side by side, theywere just about equal.  The advantage of SHM is that your X server doesn't grow to ridiculoussizes; but pixmaps can work over a network and *are* removed if yourapplication dies (one tends to use ipcrm manually quite a bit whendebugging SHM apps).  Shared memory also has the problem that some operating systems (e.g.Ultrix) seem to allow only a small number of segments (~6) to beattached to a process at once; consequently, a redraw becomesXShmAttach();XShmPutImage();XShmDetach(); on Dec systems. And Dec's 24bit displays (like the ones I tend to use most often) don't seem tosupport the extension (maybe someone compiled them wrong?), and usingpixmaps causes the X server to crash (failed mallocs), so one *has* touse the local unix domain socket (which really isn't that bad; onecopies the info three times per redraw instead of one).  In short: allowing all three forms of display, within the program is aGood Thing (minus SHM if running over a network), and let the user pickwhatever feels fastest.

"Newsgroup:sci.spacedocument_id: 60242From: buenneke@monty.rand.org (Richard Buenneke)Subject: DC-X Rollout ReportMcDonnell Douglas rolls out DC-X        HUNTINGTON BEACH, Calif. -- On a picture-perfect SouthernCalifornia day, McDonnell Douglas rolled out its DC-X rocket ship lastSaturday.  The company hopes this single-stage rocket technologydemonstrator will be the first step towards a single-stage-to-orbit (SSTO)rocket ship.        The white conical vehicle was scheduled to go to the White SandsMissile Range in New Mexico this week.  Flight tests will start inmid-June.        Although there wasn't a cloud in the noonday sky, the forecast forSSTO research remains cloudy.  The SDI Organization -- which paid $60million for the DC-X -- can't itself afford to fund full development of afollow-on vehicle.  To get the necessary hundreds of millions required fora sub-orbital DC-XA, SDIO is passing a tin cup among its sister governmentagencies.        SDIO originally funded SSTO research as a way to cut the costs fororbital deployments of space-based sensors and weapns.  However, recentchanges in SDI's political marching orders and budget cuts have made SSTOless of a priority.  Today, the agency is more interested in using DC-X asa step towards a low-cost, reusable sounding rocket.        SDIO has already done 50 briefings to other government agencies,said Col.  Simon ""Pete"" Worden, SDIO's deputy for technology.  But Wordendeclined to say how much the agencies would have to pony up for theprogram. ""I didn't make colonel by telling my contractors how much money Ihave available to spend,"" he quipped at a press conference at McDonnellDouglas Astronautics headquarters.        While SDIO has lowered its sights on the program's orbitalobjective, agency officials hail the DC-X as an example of the ""better,faster, cheaper"" approach to hardware development.  The agency believesthis philosophy can produce breakthroughs that ""leapfrog"" ahead ofevolutionary technology developments.        Worden said the DC-X illustrates how a ""build a little, test alittle"" approach can produce results on time and within budget.  He saidthe program -- which went from concept to hardware in around 18 months --showed how today's engineers could move beyond the ""miracles of ourparents' time.""        ""The key is management,"" Worden said. ""SDIO had a very light handon this project.  We had only one overworked major, Jess Sponable.""        Although the next phase may involve more agencies, Worden saidlean management and a sense of government-industry partnership will becrucial. ""It's essential we do not end up with a large managementstructure where the price goes up exponentially.""        SDIO's approach also won praise from two California members of theHouse Science, Space and Technology Committee. ""This is the directionwe're going to have to go,"" said Rep.  George Brown, the committee'sDemocratic chairman. ""Programs that stretch aout 10 to 15 years aren'tsustainable....NASA hasn't learned it yet.  SDIO has.""        Rep.  Dana Rohrbacher, Brown's Republican colleague, went further.Joking that ""a shrimp is a fish designed by a NASA design team,""Rohrbacher doubted that the program ever would have been completed if itwere left to the civil space agency.        Rohrbacher, whose Orange County district includes McDonnellDouglas, also criticized NASA-Air Force work on conventional, multi-stagedrockets as placing new casings around old missile technology. ""Let's notbuild fancy ammunition with capsules on top.  Let's build a spaceship!""         Although Rohrbacher praised SDIO's sponsorship, he said theprivate sector needs to take the lead in developing SSTO technology.        McDonnell Douglas, which faces very uncertain prospects with itsC-17 transport and Space Station Freedom programs, were more cautiousabout a large private secotro commitment. ""On very large ventures,companies put in seed money,"" said Charles Ordahl, McDonnell Douglas'senior vice president for space systems. ""You need strong governmentinvestments.""        While the government and industry continue to differ on fundingfor the DC-XA, they agree on continuing an incremental approach todevelopment.  Citing corporate history, they liken the process to DouglasAircraft's DC aircraft.  Just as two earlier aircraft paved the way forthe DC-3 transport, a gradual evolution in single-stage rocketry couldeventually lead to an orbital Delta Clipper (DC-1).        Flight tests this summer at White Sands will ""expand the envelope""of performance, with successive tests increasing speed and altitude.  Thefirst tests will reach 600 feet and demonstrate hovering, verticletake-off and landing.  The second series will send the unmanned DC-X up to5,000 feet.  The third and final series will take the craft up to 20,000feet.        Maneuvers will become more complex on third phase.  The finaltests will include a ""pitch-over"" manever that rotates the vehicle backinto a bottom-down configuration for a soft, four-legged landing.        The flight test series will be supervised by Charles ""Pete""Conrad, who performed similar maneuvers on the Apollo 12 moon landing.Now a McDonnell Douglas vice president, Conrad paised the vehiclesaircraft-like approach to operations.  Features include automatedcheck-out and access panels for easy maintainance.        If the program moves to the next stage, engine technology willbecome a key consideration.  This engine would have more thrust than thePratt & Whitney RL10A-5 engines used on the DC-X.  Each motor uses liquidhydrogen and liquid oxygen propellants to generate up to 14,760 pounds ofthrust        Based on the engine used in Centaur upper stages, the A-5 modelhas a thrust champer designed for sea level operation and three-to-onthrottling capability.  It also is designed for repeat firings and rapidturnaround.        Worden said future single-stage rockets could employtri-propellant engine technology developed in the former Soviet Union.The resulting engines could burn a dense hydrocarbon fuel at takeoff andthen switch to liquid hydrogen at higher altitudes.        The mechanism for the teaming may already be in place.  Pratt hasa technology agreement with NPO Energomash, the design bureau responsiblefor the tri-propellant and Energia cryogenic engines."	sci.space

"Newsgroup:sci.cryptDocument_id: 15255From: crypt-comments@math.ncsu.eduSubject: Cryptography FAQ 09/10 - Other MiscellanyArchive-name: cryptography-faq/part09Last-modified: 1993/4/15FAQ for sci.crypt, part 9: Other MiscellanyThis is the ninth of ten parts of the sci.crypt FAQ. The parts aremostly independent, but you should read the first part before the rest.We don't have the time to send out missing parts by mail, so don't ask.Notes such as ``[KAH67]'' refer to the reference list in the last part.The sections of this FAQ are available via anonymous FTP to rtfm.mit.edu as /pub/usenet/news.answers/cryptography-faq/part[xx].  The Cryptography FAQ is posted to the newsgroups sci.crypt, sci.answers, and news.answers every 21 days.Contents:* What is the National Security Agency (NSA)?* What are the US export regulations?* What is TEMPEST?* What are the Beale Ciphers, and are they a hoax?* What is the American Cryptogram Association, and how do I get in touch?* Is RSA patented?* What about the Voynich manuscript?* What is the National Security Agency (NSA)?  The NSA is the official security body of the U.S. government. It  was given its charter by President Truman in the late 40's, and  has continued research in cryptology till the present. The NSA is  known to be the largest employer of mathematicians in the world,  and is also the largest purchaser of computer hardware in the  world. Governments in general have always been prime employers of  cryptologists. The NSA probably possesses cryptographic expertise many  years ahead of the public state of the art, and can undoubtedly break  many of the systems used in practice; but for reasons of national  security almost all information about the NSA is classified.  Bamford's book [BAMFD] gives a history of the people and operations of  the NSA. The following quote from Massey [MAS88] highlights the  difference between public and private research in cryptography:  ``... if one regards cryptology as the prerogative of government,  one accepts that most cryptologic research will be conducted  behind closed doors. Without doubt, the number of workers engaged  today in such secret research in cryptology far exceeds that of  those engaged in open research in cryptology. For only about 10  years has there in fact been widespread open research in  cryptology. There have been, and will continue to be, conflicts  between these two research communities. Open research is common  quest for knowledge that depends for its vitality on the open  exchange of ideas via conference presentations and publications in  scholarly journals. But can a government agency, charged with  responsibilities of breaking the ciphers of other nations,  countenance the publication of a cipher that it cannot break? Can  a researcher in good conscience publish such a cipher that might  undermine the effectiveness of his own government's code-breakers?  One might argue that publication of a provably-secure cipher would  force all governments to behave like Stimson's `gentlemen', but one  must be aware that open research in cryptography is fraught with  political and ethical considerations of a severity than in most  scientific fields. The wonder is not that some conflicts have  occurred between government agencies and open researchers in  cryptology, but rather that these conflicts (at least those of which  we are aware) have been so few and so mild.''* What are the US export regulations?  In a nutshell, there are two government agencies which control  export of encryption software. One is the Bureau of Export  Administration (BXA) in the Department of Commerce, authorized by  the Export Administration Regulations (EAR). Another is the Office  of Defense Trade Controls (DTC) in the State Department, authorized  by the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR). As a rule  of thumb, BXA (which works with COCOM) has less stringent  requirements, but DTC (which takes orders from NSA) wants to see  everything first and can refuse to transfer jurisdiction to BXA.  The newsgroup misc.legal.computing carries many interesting  discussions on the laws surrounding cryptographic export, what  people think about those laws, and many other complex issues which  go beyond the scope of technical groups like sci.crypt. Make sure to  consult your lawyer before doing anything which will get you thrown in  jail; if you are lucky, your lawyer might know a lawyer who has at  least heard of the ITAR.* What is TEMPEST?  TEMPEST is a standard for electromagnetic shielding for computer  equipment. It was created in response to the discovery that  information can be read from computer radiation (e.g., from a CRT) at  quite a distance and with little effort.  Needless to say, encryption doesn't do much good if the cleartext  is available this way.* What are the Beale Ciphers, and are they a hoax?  (Thanks to Jim Gillogly for this information and John King for  corrections.)  The story in a pamphlet by J. B. Ward (1885) goes: Thomas  Jefferson Beale and a party of adventurers accumulated a huge mass  of treasure and buried it in Bedford County, Virginia, leaving  three ciphers with an innkeeper; the ciphers describe the  location, contents, and intended beneficiaries of the treasure.  Ward gives a decryption of the second cipher (contents) called B2;  it was encrypted as a book cipher using the initial letters of the  Declaration of Independence (DOI) as key. B1 and B3 are unsolved;  many documents have been tried as the key to B1.  Aficionados can join a group that attempts to solve B1 by various  means with an eye toward splitting the treasure:  The Beale Cypher Association  P.O. Box 975  Beaver Falls, PA 15010  You can get the ciphers from the rec.puzzles FAQL by including the  line:  send index  in a message to netlib@peregrine.com and following the directions.  (There are apparently several different versions of the cipher  floating around. The correct version is based on the 1885 pamphlet,  says John King <kingj@hpcc01.corp.hp.com>.)  Some believe the story is a hoax. Kruh [KRU88] gives a long list of  problems with the story. Gillogly [GIL80] decrypted B1 with the DOI  and found some unexpected strings, including ABFDEFGHIIJKLMMNOHPP.  Hammer (president of the Beale Cypher Association) agrees that this  string couldn't appear by chance, but feels there must be an  explanation; Gwyn (sci.crypt expert) is unimpressed with this  string.* What is the American Cryptogram Association, and how do I get in touch?  The ACA is an organization devoted to cryptography, with an emphasis  on cryptanalysis of systems that can be attacked either with  pencil-and-paper or computers. Its organ ``The Cryptogram'' includes  articles and challenge ciphers. Among the more than 50 cipher types in  English and other languages are simple substitution, Playfair,  Vigenere, bifid, Bazeries, grille, homophonic, and cryptarithm.  Dues are $15 for one year (6 issues); more outside of North America;  less for students under 18 and seniors. Subscriptions should be sent  to ACA Treasurer, 18789 West Hickory St., Mundelein, IL 60060.* Is RSA patented?  Yes. The patent number is 4,405,829, filed 12/14/77, granted 9/20/83.  For further discussion of this patent, whether it should have been  granted, algorithm patents in general, and related legal and moral  issues, see comp.patents and misc.legal.computing. For information  about the League for Programming Freedom see [FTPPF]. Note that one of  the original purposes of comp.patents was to collect questions such as  ``should RSA be patented?'', which often flooded sci.crypt and other  technical newsgroups, into a more appropriate forum.* What about the Voynich manuscript?  nelson@reed.edu (Nelson Minar) says there is a mailing list on the  subject.  the address to write to subscribe to the VMS mailing list  is: <voynich-request@rand.org>  the ftp archive is: rand.org:/pub/voynich  There's all sorts of information about the manuscript itself, of  course. A good bibliography can be found on the ftp site. Kahn's  ""The Codebreakers"" gives a good introduction."	sci.crypt

Ialso have 340 Pens for it as follows:  10 packs of 4 Black Oil based, 16packs of 4 Red,Green, Blue, and Black pens, 22 packs of 4 Aqueous Black,7 packs of 4 Aqueous R,G,Blue,Black,  1 pack of 6 Aqueous Multi colorpens,  and 114 assorted non-packaged pens mostly colored.    The plotter is used.  I have tested it using the Windows drivers forHP 7570 and HP 7574 and both worked fine.  It accepts either A or Bsized paper. (8.5 x 11 or 11x17).    I figure that the plotter is worth about $300 and the pens are worth atleast another $200 more..  One thing is certain, you won't need topurchase any pens for quite a while...  All of the packaged pens weresealed so they are all still fresh.  The rest were capped and seem tofunction as well.    I'd be willing to sell the pens seperate if anyone is interested injust them.

After all, one can buy strong crypto todayif one is willing to spend enough.Thus the concern is not economic.The issue most worth worrying about is that after the system takes hold, thegovernment will outlaw other systems, and something voluntary will becomethe only system available. That is a political, not an economic issue.As a separate matter, you may be making an implied advocacy for cheap securecrypto for everyone. It's true that the Clipper chip would probably preventthat except via Clipper, but ""cheap, secure crypto for everyone"" is apolitical discussion, not an economic one, and the whole point of Clipper is to resolve that political (policy) tension between securing legitimatecommunications and tapping the crooks.-- David Sternlight         Great care has been taken to ensure the accuracy of                         our information, errors and omissions excepted."	sci.crypt

It is disingeneous to compare their death to that of athletes in Munichor any other act of terrorism or mrder.  This exercise is aimed solely at diverting the issue and is far from the truth.It seems to me, Dorin, that, you are so remote and ignorant of the problemon the ground that your comments can only be charactrized as irrelevant,and heavily colored by the preconceptions and misinformation.I will try to paint the most accurate picture I can ofwhat the situation really is in South Lebanon.In article <1993Apr15.152455.14555@unocal.com>, stssdxb@st.unocal.com (Dorin Baru) writes:|> Is there any Israeli a civilian, in your opinion ?|> |> Now, I do not condone myself bombing villages, any kind of villages.|> But you claim these are villages with civilians, and Iraelis claim they are |> camps filled with terrorists. You claim that israelis shell the villages with the|> 'hope' of finding a terrorist or so. If they kill one, fine, if not, too bad, |> civilians die, right ? I am not so sure. I am.  I was back in my home village this last summer.  For your informationwe are PEOPLE, not a bunch of indiscriminate terrorists.  Most of the people in my village are regular inhabitants that go about their dailybusiness, some work in the fields, some own small shops, others areolder men that go to the coffe shop and drink coffee.  Is that so hard toimagine ????  It is NOT a ""terrorist camp"" as you and the Israelis like to view the villages they are small communities with kids playing soccerin the streets, women preparing lunch, men playing cards, etc.....SOME young men, usually aged between 17 to 30 years are members ofthe Lebanese resistance.  Even the inhabitants of the village do not know who these are, they are secretive about it, but most people oftensuspect who they are and what they are up to.  These young men aresupported financially by Iran most of the time.  They sneak arms andammunitions into the occupied zone where they set up booby trapsfor Israeli patrols.  Every time an Israeli soldier is killed or injuredby these traps, Israel retalliates by indiscriminately bombing villagesof their own choosing often killing only innocent civilians.  Once theyare back they announce that they bombed a ""terrorist  hideout"" wherean 8 year old girl just happened to be.We are now accustomed to Israeli tactics, and we figure that this is the Israeli way of telling us that ""if you're gonna hurt our soldiersyou're gonna pay the price"".  We accept this as a price we have to payto free our land, Israel knows very well that it is not really hurtingthe resistance that much militarily with these strikes, but ratherjust keeping the pressure on the villagers to demand from their young men to stop attacking Israeli soldiers since these attacks aretaking a heavy toll on the lives of the civilian villagers.Israel's retalliation policy is cold hearted, but a reality thatwe have come to accept and deal with, the Lebanese Resistanceon the other hand is not going to stop its attacks on OCCUPYING ISRAELI SOLDIERS until they withdraw, this is the only real leverage that they have to force Israel to withdraw.The people of South Lebanon are occupied, or shelled by Israel on a regular basis.  We do not want to be occupied.  If Israel insists thatthe so called ""Security Zone"" is necessary for the protection of Northern Israel, than it will have to pay the price of its occupationwith the blood of its soldiers.  If Israel is interested in peace,than it should withdraw from OUR land.  We are not asking for the establishment of a Lebanese occupied zone in northern Israel to protectour villages that are attacked on a regular basis by Israel, so thebest policy seems to be the removal of Israeli occupation and theestablishment of peace keeping troops along the border.I have written before on this very newsgroup, that the onlyreal solution will come as a result of a comprehensive peacesettlement whereby Israel withdraws to its own borders andpeace keeping troops are stationed along the border to insureno one on either side of the border is shelled.This is the only realistic solution, it is time for Israel torealize that the concept of a ""buffer zone"" aimed at protectingits northern cities has failed.  In fact it has caused much moreIsraeli deaths than the occasional shelling of Northern Israelwould have resulted in.  If Israel really wants to save some Israeli lives it would withdraw unilaterally from the so-called ""Security Zone"" before the conclusionof the peace talks.  Such a move would save Israeli lives,advance peace efforts, give Israel a great moral lift, better Israel's public image abroad and give it an edge in the peace negociations since Israel can rightly claim that it is genuinely interested in peace and has already offered some important concessions.Along with such a withdrawal Israel could demand that Hizbollahbe disarmed by the Lebanese government and warn that it will not accept any attacks against its northern cities and that if such ashelling occurs than it will consider re-taking the buffer zoneand will hold the Lebanese and Syrian government responsible for it.There seems to be very little incentive for the Syrian and Lebanesegoovernment to allow Hizbollah to bomb Israel proper under such circumstances, and now the Lebanese government has proven that it iscapable of controlling and disarming all militias as they didin all other parts of Lebanon.  |> If you ask me those questions, I will have no problem answering (not with a |> question, as you did) : No, NOBODY is qualified candidate for murder, nothing|> justifies murder.I agree, only in the case of the Isareli soldiers their killingCANNOT be qualified as murder, no matter what you say.

Can it be thatcriminal/Nazi Armenians of ASALA/SDPA/ARF hate Muslims for ideological reasons regardless of what they do?

And today, they put Azeris in the most unbearable conditions any other nation had ever known in history.                               Source: The Times, 2 March 1992CORPSES LITTER HILLS IN KARABAKHANATOL LIEVEN COMES UNDER FIRE WHILE FLYING WITH AZERBAIJANI FORCES TO INVESTIGATE THE MASS KILLINGS OF REFUGEES BY ARMENIAN TROOPS...As we swooped low over the snow-covered hills of Nagorno-Karabagh we saw the scattered corpses. Apparently, the refugees had been shot down as they ran. An Azerbaijani film of the places we flew over, shown to journalists afterwards, showed DOZENS OF CORPSES lying in various parts of the hills.The Azerbaijanis claim that AS MANY AS 1000 have died in a MASS KILLING of AZERBAIJANIS fleeing from the town of Khodjaly, seized by Armenians last week. A further 4,000 are believed to be wounded, frozen to death or missing... Seven of us squatted in the cabin of an Azerbaijani M24 attack helicopter as we flew to investigate the claims of the mass killings. Suddenly there was a thump against the underside of the aircraft, a red flash of tracer ripped past the starboard wing, and the helicopter rocked sharply. We swung round, and there was a deafening burst of fire from the cannon under our wing as the helicopter crew returned fire.We had been fired on from an Armenian anti-aircraft post. We swung round again, tipped to starboard and appeared to dive straight down into a valley. The brown earth swooped around our heads, the helicopter swung round again and followed the contours of the ground. Our cannon fired repeated blasts.Later it emerged that a civilian helicopter that we had been escorting had landed successfully at Nakhichevanik in the east of the disputed enclave of Nagorno-Karabakh, to pick up some of the dead. We had, in fact, been attacked both by ground fire and by an Armenian helicopter. I had seen the Armenian helicopter intermittently through the window, its cannons firing, but had thought - mistakenly - that it was on ""our side"". Our group of Western journalists had embarked on a search-and-rescue flight that had become a combat mission.Our flight consisted of the civilian passenger helicopter and two M24 Soviet attack helicopters in the Azerbaijani service, nicknamed flying crocodiles for their armour. Our party was in the second crocodile. The civilian helicopter's job was to land in the mountains and pick up bodies at sites of the mass killings. The attack helicopters were there to give covering fire if necessary.The operation showed a striking sign of the disintegration of the Soviet armed forces because our pilot was a Russian officer. An Azerbaijani official told us that there were now five former Soviet military helicopters -and their pilots- fighting for Azerbaijan. ""They have signed contracts to fly for us,"" he said. The helicopter we engaged in combat was most probably flown by a brother-officer of our Russian pilot, but fighting for the Armenians.We had taken off just before 5pm on Saturday from Agdam airfield, an heated for the Armenian-controlled mountains of Karabakh, a sheer white wall in the distance. The civilian helicopter picked up four corpses, and it was during this and a previous mission that an Azerbaijani cameraman filmed the several the several dozen bodies on the hillsides. We then took off again in a hurry and speed back towards Azerbaijani lines. Azerbaijani gunners on the last hill before the plain - and safety - gazed up at us as we passed.Back at the airfield in Agdam, we took a look the bodies the civilian helicopter had picked up. Two old men a small girl were covered with blood, their limbs contorted by the cold and rigor mortis. They had been shot.What did our Russian pilot think of the tragedy, our close shave, and the war in Nagorno-Karabakh?

The accelerator costs about $1400 whereasthe upgrade costs $2131 (just quoted from my dealer).  However the Q700upgrade gives you very fast built in video that supports monitors up to 21""with 8 bit depth and up to 16"" at 24 bit depth (with additional VRAM).  Italso has a SCSI port capable of a much faster throughput than the CI, whichmakes a big difference if you have a fast hard drive.  If the improved video and SCSI features are important to you, you'rebetter off getting the Q700 upgrade, otherwise save some money and get anaccelerator.Paul"	comp.sys.mac.hardware

Surprise, surprise!	This is true, but it's not quite the whole story.  There were 	actually some people who were more careful in their methodology	who also replicated the 'phantom leaf effect.'    One of the most influential critics of Kirlian Electrophotography    is a Theosophist (and threfore presumably willing to entertain the    hypothesis of scientific evidence for a human aura, electromagnetic    or otherwise), professor of electrical engineering at London's    City University, and a past president of the Society for Psychic Research     named A. J. Ellison.    After years of studying the method and the claims, Ellison    came to the conclusion that the photographic images are what we    calls 'Lichtenberg Figures,' an effect of intermittent ionization of    the air around the object.  It's a bit more complicated than    'not wiping off the plates,' but it comes down to the same thing    in the end, Kirlian electrophotography has much more limited    value (if any) than was previously widely thought.  Electrical and    magnetic fields generated by the body are much too small to be    of much use diagnostically without very elaborate equipment and    usually also tracer chemicals.					kind regards,					todd+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------+| Todd I.

What you described SOUNDS the same to me.  In fact, what little& i've studied on trannies, the instructor referred to the synchros as ""dogs""& and said they were synonymous.  The gears are always meshed in a synchronized& gearbox, and you slip the synchro gears back and forth by shifting. Or at least,& that is what i was taught.  Explain, por favour?Motorcycle transmissions don't have synchros.  The engagment dogs are verycorse and sloppy.  There are maybe 6-10 teeth (dogs) on the side of thegears that engage the next gear over as the forks slide the gears backand forth.  To shift:  start to apply pressure at the same time theclutch is pulled (the clutch is a hand lever) and shift quickly.  If you try a slow lazy shift it will grind, you just have to pop it intothe next gear before it has a chance to grind.  There isn't a neutralbetween gears (obviously there is, but you can't select it with theshifter) so double clutching is not a possibility.  ""speed shifting""(which is what I have always heard ""clutchless shifting"" called) workspretty well for upshifts with some practice, but I usually use theclutch-especially for the lower gears.I think auto (as in automobile) trannys are similar, except that theengagment dogs are very fine, with no slop.  And the addition ofsyncho rings.  The gear teeth are always engaged in auto transmissionsthat are synchronized, but may not be in non-synchro gears (reverseand sometimes first).  --Frank Ball   1UR-M          frankb@sad.hp.com    (707) 794-4168 work,Hewlett Packard             (707) 794-3844 fax,  (707) 538-3693 home1212 Valley House Drive     IT175, XT350, Seca 750, '62 F-100, PL510Rohnert Park CA 94928-4999  KC6WUG, LAW, AMA, Dod #7566, I'm the NRA."	rec.autos

The 27th was a short day atwork, we worked until eleven or eleven-thirty and left for home. I decidedto go for a short walk. I went to Primorsky Park. I walked past the EternalFlame and saw a group of about 8 to 10 people standing there. When I hadwalked another 15 to 20 yards I heard the screech of automobile brakesbehind me. I turned my head toward the sound. It was a light blue GAZ-24Volga. I see that the people who were standing there have gone over to the car. A man and a woman get out. The man is expensively dressed, in a suit,and the woman has a raincoat on. She doesn't have anything on her head, and her hair is let down, sightly reddish hair, a heavy-set woman. They're 40 to 45 years old. They get something out of the trunk. The people start to helpthem. I become curious just what are they pulling out of there?When I got up close I heard them turn something on. I didn't see what it was, but it was probably a tape recorder. They put it on the ground near the Eternal Flame honoring the 26 Baku Commissars and formed a tight circlearound it. I ask, ""What's going on?"" Someone tells me, ""Come listen."" Wellthey were Azerbaijanis, I had asked in Azerbaijani. I hear appeals: ""BrotherMuslims, our time has come . . . "" and something else along that line. Ididn't understand what it was all about. I walked around the group trying to get a look at the owner of the tape recorder. But the circle drew in tighter. New people started coming from various directions, five here, seven there. Andthe comments started: ""Right, we should slaughter the Armenians!"" and ""There'sno need to be afraid, all of Moscow is behind us."" I even heard that: ""All Moscow is behind us."" Well I watched and listened in and realized that this was no joke. I quietly left and went home.Now before that at work I had heard that something was going on in Karabagh, that there were demonstrations there. Well, people were saying all kinds of things, but I didn't have any idea what was really going on.My wife and son were at home, but my daughter was at my aunt's house in Baku. I didn't say anything to my wife. We sat and drank tea. Sometime around twoo'clock right behind our house suddenly there is noise, whistling, and shouting. I looked out the window and saw a crowd. The crowd is moving slowly,like they show on TV when blacks in South Africa are striking or having a demonstration and move slowly.My wife asks what's going on out there. I say I don't know. I put on someoutdoor clothes and went out to find out what it was all about. In the crowdpeople are shouting ""Down with the Armenians!"" and ""Death to the Armenians!"" Iwaited for the entire crowd to pass. At first they went down Narimanov Street on the side with the SK club and the City Party Committee; then they turned and went against the traffic--it's one way there--down the Street of the 26 Baku Commissars toward the streetcar line. I went home and told my wife there was a demonstration going on. In fact I thought that we were having the same kind of demonstrations that they had had in Yerevan and in Karabagh. Aside from the things they were shouting, I was surprised that there were only youngpeople in the crowd. And they were minors, under draft age.My wife and son wanted to go upstairs to visit a friend, but I was kind ofuneasy and said, ""No, let's stay at home instead."" An hour went by, or maybe an hour and a half. Well, I wasn't keeping track of the time, I can't sayexactly how long it was. I look and see another crowd on Narimanov, but now onthe side with the microdistricts, the bazaar, and the Rossiya movie theater.I put outside clothes on and went out again. There's noise, an uproar outside,and the crowd has grown. There are more people. And whereas the first time there were individual shouts, this time they are more focused, more aggressive. No, I think, something's wrong here, this isn't any demonstration.They would run, stop, then walk quickly and make sharp dashes, and then run again. I was walking along the sidewalk and they were in the street. I followed them. I was thinking I'd just watch and see. Who knew where this was leading? We came out on Lenin Square. At the square the SK club is on one side, and the City Party Committee is on the other. I went toward the square and heard noise and shouting, as though the whole town had turned out. There was some sort of a rally going on. I go closer and hear exclamations, appeals.I heard both anti-Armenian and anti-Soviet appeals. ""We don't need perestroika, we want to go on living like we have been."" Now what did they mean by ""living like we have been?"" The Azerbaijanis work like everyone else. But too many people live at the expense of the government and at the expense of others. Speculation, theft, and cheating go on all the time. And not just in Azerbaijan, everywhere, in all the republics, but I've never seen it anywhere else like I have in Azerbaijan.Now at this rally someone says that they should go around to the Armenians' apartments and drive them out, beat them and drive them out. True, I didn't hear them say ""kill them"" over the microphone, I only heard ""beat them and drive them out."" I stayed at the square a few minutes longer. First one, thenanother are going up onto the stage, and no one tries to stop the crowd. Offto the side of the crowd there were small groups of three or four people, and I think they were MVD [Ministry of Internal Affairs] or State Security KGB.There were also uniformed policemen there, but I didn't see any of them try to pacify the crowd. New people kept coming up onto the stage.Well I had finally decided that this could end badly: This was nodemonstration, and I had to protect my family.I left the Square to return home and suddenly noticed a truck. It was nextto the City Party Committee, on Narimanov Street, it stood next to the tai-lor's shop there, a low truck, and it had low, wooden panels. I see that some-thing is being unloaded, crates of some sort. I decided to go look becauseafter all those appeals I was apprehensive and thought there might be weaponsin there. They pulled the crates out onto the square, not toward the City Party Committee, but toward the SK club. And when I went right up to them I saw that they were cases of vodka. There were two people handing down the cases from the bed of the truck, and on the ground there were many people, 15 to 20. They were handing them down from the truck and each case was carried off by two people. Two people, one case of vodka. And there was a man standingright next to the truck and he was handing out roundish black lumps, maybe about the size of a fist, maybe a little bigger or smaller. It was anasha. When I passed next to that person, he stood with his side to me. There was about a yard and a half between us, and two people were standing near him. He has a package in his hand, and he's pulling out anasha and handing it out. I have never smoked it myself. Once I tried it for fun, but I've seen a lot of people smoke it, I've seen it many times, and I know what it is. I strolled around and no one asked me who I was or what I was doing there.Before I got to the Glass Bazaar I heard more howling, more warlike shouting. I turned around and saw them running. Well I'll just keep on going like I am, I thought. When they caught up with me I saw that they were carrying flags. And I recognized the person who was carrying the flag on my side of the street. He's a young guy, 21 or 22 years old. He was carrying a red flag, which had ""Ermeni oryum"" written on it in Azerbaijani, that means ""Death to Armenians!"" That guy used to live off the same courtyard as us. I don't reallyknow what his name is, but I know his father very well. His father's name isRafik; he used to be a cook, and then became head chef. He used to have a darkblue Zhiguli van, then he sold it and now he has a white Zhiguli 06. His family, as I said, lived on the same courtyard as we did. Our building was on Narimanov Street, and theirs was on the Street of the 26 Baku Commissars; their apartment was in the far entryway, on the fifth floor, the door on the left. Now Rafik's little brother lives there, and he, Rafik, I heard, got a new apartment either in the forth or eighth microdistrict. In a word, his son was carrying a flag that said ""Death to Armenians!"" I was surprised because before this I had gotten the impression that all of this nonsense was being done not by people from Sumgait, but by Azerbaijanis from Agdam and Kafan.Well anyway I went home. My wife was upset. I told her, ""It's OK, it'll pass, they're young kids, they've just gotten all whooped up."" Naturally I didn't want her to get overly upset. After a while a new surge of crowd went by. And this time they were breaking glass. I could hear it breaking, but I couldn't see where. Well I think, here we go, the machine's in motion. They weren't handing out that vodka and anasha for nothing. I didn't see people drinking and smoking on the spot, but they certainly hadn't unloaded the vodka and hashish to put in a store window!So the thought flashed through my head that the machine was running, no one would stop them now, they weren't even trying, although, I'll say it again, the police were there, I saw them. And it's not just that the police weren't breaking them up, they were joking with them, they were having a good time. True, at the time I couldn't even imagine that under our government, our much-vaunted leadership--and I'm not afraid to say these words: so many people died, So many women were abused, and how many abominations there were!--I couldn't imagine that under our much-vaunted authorities, and if I were to be specific, I would say under the much-touted authorities in our city of Sumgait, I couldn't imagine that such things could take place.When they started breaking glass I told my wife and son: ""Let's go upstairs."" We went to our neighbors, the Grigorians, on the fourth floor. And in the evening, when those crowds started going past again, I went outside once more.I stopped at ""The Corner,"" a place called that right next to the bazaar. I look and see a crowd on the run. And there, a few yards from the entrance to the bazaar, are three respectable-looking men of around, say, 50 years old. The crowd was running and one of the three waved with his arm and pointed toward the bazaar. And then the whole crowd, as though it were one person, wheeled and raced toward the bazaar. And not a soul went past those three, as though it were off limits! Well everything got all churned up, there was more noise, and the glass was flying again.We spent the night at the neighbors'. My apartment was on the first floor,there was really no way to defend yourself there.In the morning I went out to buy bread and to see what was happening in town. On the way I saw someone hunched up, still. I never found out who it was or what happened to him. There were 10 to 15 people standing near him. I got the bread and on my way back, they had gathered around the person who was lying there hunched up, sort of enclosing him; because of the way they were standingyou couldn't even see him.That was on the morning of February 28.

Chance would have it that ""my weekend"" with my daughter has fallen upon Easter Weekend this year.Although I am Presbyterian, I had married a Catholic woman. We decidedthat the Catholic moray of indoctrination of the spouse into the faithwas too confining (and restrictive due to time as we had already set adate), and we were married in a Christian Church which was non-denominational.During the years of our marriage, we did not often attend church. When our daughter was born, some years later, my wife insisted that she be baptised as Catholic. This wasn't a problem with me.During a separation of five years, my ex-wife was taken ill with a diseasethat affected her mental capacities. She was confined to a mental ward fortwo months before it was diagnosed. It has since been treated ""effectively"".In other words, professionals have deemed her a functioning member of society.During the recuperation, my ex-wife has embraced Buddism. Her influence overmy daughter has been substantial, and has primarily allowed me only Saturdayvisitation for a number of years. During this period I have read Bible studybooks to my daughter, and tried to keep her aware of her Christian heritage.Last fall, our divorce was finalized after a year of viscious divorce hearings.At that time I was awarded visitation rights every other weekend. At that time,I started taking my daughter to church quite often, although not every weekend.I did this to attempt to strengthen the Christian ethic and expose her to areligious community.Today, Easter Sunday, I took my daughter to church. When it came time for Communion, my daughter took the bread (The body of Christ) but left the wine(The blood of Christ) professing that she was too young for wine. She thenballed the bread up in her hand and tried to descretely throw it under thepew in front of us.I feel this was a slap in the face to me, my religion, and an afront to herreligious heritage. It can be construed as breaking several of the commandmentsif you try. I really felt dishonored by the action.My daughter is only nine years old, but I think she should have been old andmature enough to realize her actions. I have difficulty blaming her directlyfor religious teachings her mother swears to, but when I discussed this withmy daughter she made it clear she believed in Buddhism and not Christianity.My initial response of anger (moderated) was to suggest if there is no faithin Christ then why does she celebrate Easter, or Christmas? I suggested Iwould never force her to practice my religious beliefs by celebrating holidayswith her again.I do not want to ""drive her from the fold"", and would be willing to allow herto continue practicing Buddhism (as though I had a choice seeing her onlyfor two days out of fourteen) but I want her to want to embrace Christianity.Any suggestions?If you have a response, please e-mail me a copy.

They may have other patents like this.Apple has patented their implementation of regions, which presumablyincludes the internal data structure (which has never been officiallydocumented by Apple).  Apple cannot patent the concept of a region.I'm guessing that either NuTek reverse-engineered Apple's internal datastructure for regions (I dunno if this would hold up in court), or theycame up with their own data structure.

As long as the region isn't being stored on disk andtransferred from a Mac to a NuTek clone (or vice versa), it doesn'tmatter if NuTek uses a completely different internal data structure.I remember reading that Apple also has a patent on their ADB hardware,and that the NuTek clones would therefore be lacking an ADB port.

In actuality it is ""chorion"", which is the last word Acts> 1:18.  Unfortunately my Greek dictionary does not discuss ""chorion"" so I> cannot report as to the nuances of the word.I abhor publishing trash (I abhor it of myself even more than I do fromothers, but since I do not present myself as an authority on the subject, I donot feel dishonest, though I do openly admit ignorance and incompetence inthis example).  Thus I felt honor bound to do a better set of researchspecifically on the word.  First it should be noted that Greek grammar is notas tough as I first assumed (it is not nontrivial by any means, and I still amnot competent with it, but it is not as opaque as I had thought).  It turnsout that while the Index for the Bauer-Arndt-Gingrich ""Greek Lexicon"" renderseach verse in order, each word within a verse is put in greek alphabeticalorder.  Thus while the the meaning of the verse is decipherable, the syntax isfar from clear.  On the other hand, a Greek-English Intralinear Bible makesthings a lot more comprehendable.  And yes, the word for field in Acts 1:18 isindeed ""chorion."" Now I've checked several Greek-English lexicons:	""Greek English Lexicon of the New Testament,"" Louw and Nida	""Robinson's Greek and English Lexicon of the New Testament""	""Greek English Lexicon of the New Testament,"" Grimm	""Word study Concordance,"" Tynsdale	""A Greek English Lexicon of the New Testament and other 	 early Christian Writings,"" Bauer-Arndt-Gingrich	""The New Analytical Greek Lexicon,"" PerschbacherIn each case the meaning of the word Chorion was given variously as:	A space, place, region, district, field, area, ""country place,"" 	land, farm, estate, ""a bit of tillage"", and similar meanings.Nowhere do any of these books mention anything about ""grave."" As some of these books go into great detail, I would be very surprised to find that these books are all inadequate and Mr Archer is the only competent scholar in Greek.  I think it more likely that Mr Archer's investigations into ""contradictions"" to be once again, as your friend said it, ""lacking in substance,"" and thus Archer is again shown worthless as an expert witness (By the way Mr DeCenso, I would have honorably presented my results on this matter, even if I had found themto support Mr Archer's contentions). By the way, among these lexicons, (eg: Robinson's) is the definition of""agros,"" the word used in Matthew 27 to describe the field bought.  The word""agros"" is defined as ""a field in the country."" Chorion is specifically notedas a synonym to agros.  This is significant, as it is evidence of how sillyBullinger's exegisis was, which stated that the word for ""field"" in Matthew(ie: agros) is different from the word for ""field"" in Acts (ie: chorion), andthus we must be talking about two different fields (Of course you alreadyadmit how stupid Bullinger's exegisis is, but this was a small serendipitywhich drives the point home).

However, it's still a heck of a machine for the price -- itis quite rugged, and many people out there swear by it.  (It's probably themost popular walkman-style DAT machine out there.)        Anyway, the guy selling it is Bryan Davis (bdavis@netcom.com), andhere's what he told me:-------------------------------------------------------------------------------Here is what is included:        - TCD-D3 DATman.        - (2) RCA to Stereo 1/8"" plug cables.  One for analog input, one for          analog output.        - Optical digital I/O cable (one lead for input, one for output).        - A copy of my sales receipt with a note about your purchase.  The          unit is still under factory warrantee.        - AC adaptor/battery charger.        - Rechargable battery.I paid $750 + tax for it so I hope you don't mind if I keep the 60 minutetape it came with (I have some samples on it!).[By the way, he spent at least $100 too much for it, unless he's including an extended warranty, which is advised for DAT machines, since it costs about $300 to replace the head when it wears out, and it probably will within 5 years if you use it a lot.. -- davisonj]-------------------------------------------------------------------------------        I'm not going to quote my sale price for him: that would not be nice.Send him mail and ask him what he wants.        Again, I've used the TCD-D3, and I have to say that I can certainlyunderstand why it is as popular as it is.  I've been using one for a littlewhile, and although I had some problems with it recently, I should also pointout that the particular one I was using had been on the road for two years andhad truly been _used_ during that time.  (This is the same exact DAT machinethat was lugged around the U.S. and Canada to record the Jazz ButcherConspiracy for their recent live album.)        Bryan Davis says:-------------------------------------------------------------------------------I know at least half a dozen professional musicians and record labelsin S.F who use that model (and have been for a while) with no reportedproblem.  My problem is that everyone I know already has one.-------------------------------------------------------------------------------        'nuff said.        The reason I'm not getting it is that I found someone else selling me aunit that features phono-plug SPDIF I/O instead of optical (I don't have anyoptical ports on my equipment, but you, the reader, might), and it also hassome other bells & whistles that the TCD-D3 doesn't.  (I am also paying morefor the alternative.)  Note that phono-plug-to-optical SPDIF adapters areavailable if you absolutely must have one.        Of course, it has SCMS.  All consumer decks do.

Ifthis is the true order of events then the 'cult' could not knowthat a search warrant was being served and since there was no proofthat these guys were police,  the 'cult' had every right to defendthemselves.: Torching themselves shows briliant tactics, and convinces me: they *realy* belong in society ...If you watch actual footage of the fire from start to finish itis not at all clear that fire wasn't started by the tanks.  Thepeople who survived are claiming that the fire was started bythe tanks knocking over some kerosene lanterns.  The FBI isclaiming that the 'cult' started the fire.'they *realy* belong in society' is a catchy phrase butI'm personally waiting to see what the Texas Rangers have to sayabout it all before I pass judgment.   Why don't you do the same.Some more interesting facts about the Waco incident:1)  The original assault was conducted by BATF officers wearing    an assorted types of camouflage.  I saw, on CNN, at least    three different types.   I would be hard pressed to identify    a bunch of guys in 'bring-your-own' battle fatigues as    uniformed officers of the law even if they were claiming to    be police.    2)  The BATF has been lying from the beginning:    + ""We only had handguns"" - the original footage showed 4 BATF      officers on a roof top getting shot at,  one had an MP-5      assault sub-machine gun.    + ""We were out gunned"" - sub-machine guns and shotguns are the      BEST in quarters weapon,  you can't be out gunned when you      have the best guns available for the job.    + ""We didn't know they had guns that would shoot through doors!"" -      this one is the best,  there are very few guns that won't shoot      through a household door,  or through a house WALL for that      matter.  Since officers from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and      *Firearms* should know that,  they are either lying or incredibly      incompetent.  Not to mention criminally negligent if they are      shooting bullets that they think will stop when the encounter      plywood.    + ""We had a search warrant.  Actually, we had an arrest warrant.       No, wait,  we had both.  Yeah, that's the ticket.       Oh, and they're child molesters too.  And they make *drugs*.       Did we mention we think they have rocket launchers.""      - The story from BATF and FBI spokespeople has changed daily      and their claims were getting increasingly outrageous.      3)  Throughout the siege the FBI and BATF have be claiming that one    of their biggest concerns was that Koresh and his followers would    mass suicide.   Now they are claiming that that's what he did    AND that they are surprised that he did.

It is thought to form formaldehyde and known tofor methanol in the degredation pathway that the body uses to eliminate substances.  The real issue is whether the levels of methanol and formaldehydeproduced are high enough to cause significant damage, as both are toxic toliving cells.  All I can say is that I will not consume it.  Phenylalanine isnothing for you to worry about.  It is an amino acid, and everyone uses smallquantities of it for protein synthesis in the body.

The last couple of monthes she has been seeing a hoemoepath (sp?) and been givensome drops to re-activate either her thyroidal gland and/or the 'message-center' in the brain (sorry about the approximate language,but I haven't got many clues to what the english terms are, but the brain-area is called the 'hypofyse' in norwegian.) My questions are: has anyone had/heard of success in using this approach?Her values have been (slowly but) steadily sinking, any comment on theprobability of improvement? Although the doctor has told her to 'eatnormally', my wife has dieted vigorously to keep her weight as she feelsthat is part of keeping an edge over the illness/condition, may thisaffect the treatment, development?I can get the exact figures for her tests for anyone interested, and Iwill greatly value any information/opinion/experience on this topic.I don't intend this post to be either a flaming of the establishedmedical profession or a praise for alternatives, I am just relayingevents as they have happened.Sincerely,Erik A.

The noise you hear is due to the momentaryopening and closing of the path.The noiseless way of transfering audio is to ground the circuit.  In highimpedance audio circuits a resistive ""T"" is constructed close to characteristicimpedance of the circuit.  Grounding the imputs (connected to the T) transfersthe audio.In low impedance circuits transformers are usually used, and the inputs areshorted out or grounded.  Secondaries are paralleled at the characteristicimpedance.Sometimes if it is necessary to actually switch audio, a second contact is usedto momentarily short the circuit output for the duration of the switching time.Telephone relays are handy, because contacts can be adjusted to ""Make beforebreak and Vica Versa"" but I haven't seen any of these for years.Nowadys switching is done electronically with OP amps, etc.A novel circuit I used to build was a primitive ""optical isolator"".. It consistsof a resistive photocell and a lamp, all packaged in a tube.  When the lamp isoff the cell is high resistance.  Turn the lamp on and the resistance lowerspassing the audio.  Once again this device in a ""T"" switches the audio.  Varyingthe lamp resistance give a remote volume control.  Use 2 variable resisters andyou have a mixer!Lots of luck!-- 73, Tom================================================================================Tom Wagner, Audio Visual Technician.

The owner of the Admirals (sorry, I can't remember his name)either owns or at least shelled out the majority of the funds to build theBradley Center.Supposedly he was approached by the NHL about an expansion franchise, but turned it down because he thought the franchise fee of $50 million was toohigh.Like I said, I don't know whether this story is true or just a rumor, but ifit's true, don't look for an NHL team in Milwaukee anytime soon.

The ""large""grains have sizes of order 0.1 micron and absorb visible light withfair efficiency.  However, at temperatures below 100 K, 90% of thethermal emission will be beyond 22 microns, where radiatingefficiency is poor.  (A small antenna cannot easily radiate at longwavelengths.)  Thus the grains must heat up more in order to radiatethe energy they have absorbed.Moreover, the IRAS observations had a maximum wavelength of 100microns.  Grains colder than 30 K will radiate primarily at longerwavelengths, and IRAS would be relatively insensitive to them.  Inthe extreme limit, grains as cold as 5 K will be almost undetectableby any conceivable observation.Worse still, IRAS color temperatures are heavily contaminated by apopulation of ""small"" grains.  These grains have only perhaps 50atoms, and when they are hit by a single photon they heat up totemperatures of several hundred or 1000 K.  Of course they coolquickly and then stay cold for a while, but _when they are radiating_the characteristic temperature is several hundred K.  Even a smallpopulation of these grains can dramatically raise the observed""average"" temperature.A model for local infrared emission consistent with COBE data hasthree components.  These represent scattered radiation from Zodiacaldust (color temperature 5500 K), thermal emission from Zodiacal dust(Tc = 280 K), and thermal emission from Galactic dust (Tc=25 K).  Atthe ecliptic poles, the emissivities or dilution factors arerespectively 1.9E-13, 4E-8, and 2E-5.  The first two are roughlydoubled in the ecliptic plane.To find the thermal equilibrium temperature, we add up the dilutionfactor times the fourth power of temperature for all components, thentake the fourth root.  In the table below, starlight comes fromAllen's number that stellar emission from the whole sky is equivalentto 460 zero mag stars with B-V color of 0.75.  No doubt careful workcould do much better.  (The person who suggested starlight had adilution factor of E-4 must have been remembering wrong.  We would becooked if that were the case.  In any event, the energy density ofstarlight comes out about the same as that of the microwavebackground, and I believe that to be correct.)                         Dilution   Temp.

There's documentation on how to use the shared memory extension in theX11R5 distribution.

The advantage of SHM is that your X server doesn't grow to ridiculoussizes; but pixmaps can work over a network and *are* removed if yourapplication dies (one tends to use ipcrm manually quite a bit whendebugging SHM apps).  Shared memory also has the problem that some operating systems (e.g.Ultrix) seem to allow only a small number of segments (~6) to beattached to a process at once; consequently, a redraw becomesXShmAttach();XShmPutImage();XShmDetach(); on Dec systems. And Dec's 24bit displays (like the ones I tend to use most often) don't seem tosupport the extension (maybe someone compiled them wrong?), and usingpixmaps causes the X server to crash (failed mallocs), so one *has* touse the local unix domain socket (which really isn't that bad; onecopies the info three times per redraw instead of one).  In short: allowing all three forms of display, within the program is aGood Thing (minus SHM if running over a network), and let the user pickwhatever feels fastest.

"Newsgroup:rec.sport.baseballdocument_id: 104767From: steph@pegasus.cs.uiuc.edu (Dale Stephenson)Subject: Hits Stolen -- Left Field 1992Disclaimer -- This is for fun.In my computerized baseball game, I keep track of a category called""stolen hits"", defined as a play made that ""an average fielder would notmake with average effort.""  Using the 1992 Defensive Averages postedby Sherri Nichols (Thanks Sherri!), I've figured out some defensive statsfor the leftfielders. Hits Stolen have been redefined as ""Plays KevinBass would not have made.""OK, I realize that's unfair.  Kevin's probably the victim of pitching staff,fluke shots, and a monster park factor.  But let's put it this way:  If wereplaced every leftfielder in the league with someone with Kevin's 49.4% outmaking ability, how many extra hits would go by?To try and correlate it to reality a little more, I've calculated NetHits Stolen, based on the number of outs made compared to what a leagueaverage fielder would make.  By the same method I've calculated Net Extra Bases (doubles and triples let by).Finally, I throw all this into a a formula I call Defensive Contribution, orDCON :->.  Basically, it represents the defensive contribution of a player.I add this number to OPS to get DOPS (Defense + Onbase Plus Slug), whichshould represent the player's total contribution to the team.  So don'ttake it too seriously.  The formula for DCON appears at the end of thisarticle.The short version -- definition of termsHS -- Hits Stolen -- Extra outs compared to Kurt StillwellNHS -- Net Hits Stolen -- Extra outs compared to average fielderNDP -- Net Double Plays -- Extra double plays turned compared to avg fielderNEB -- Net Extra Bases --  Extra bases prevented compared to avg. fielderDCON -- Defensive Contribution -- bases and hits prevented, as a rate.DOPS -- DCON + OPS -- quick & dirty measure of player's total contribution.National LeagueName            HS   NHS   NEB   DCON    DOPSGonzalez, L.    63    28    20   .192    .866Gilkey, B.      52    23    14   .150    .941Clark, G.       46    11    11   .065    .726Alou, M.        20     3    12   .052    .835Bonds, B.       54     9    -7   .019   1.099May, D.         21     0    -7  -.020    .659Gant, R.        31    -5    -2  -.021    .715Bass, K.         0   -24    -4  -.126    .600Ordered by DOPS1.099 Bonds .941 Gilkey .866 Gonzalez .835 Alou .726 Clark .718 *NL Average* .715 Gant .659 May .600 BassAmerican League---------------Name            HS   NHS   NEB   DCON    DOPSRaines, T.      53    22    20   .111    .896Anderson, B.    65    30     8   .102    .924Henderson, R.   43    20     4   .101    .984Vaughn, G.      55    27    -3   .095    .817Gladden, D.     25     4     8   .038    .699Hall, M.        29     6    -2   .017    .756Mack, S.        38     6    -8   .005    .866Polonia, L.     10   -11    10  -.019    .647McReynolds, K.  13    -8    -9  -.064    .711Maldanado, C.    9   -21   -12  -.105    .714Reimer, K.       5   -18   -16  -.102    .671Order by DOPS.984 Henderson.924 Anderson.896 Raines.866 Mack.817 Vaughn.756 Hall.733 *AL Average*.714 Maldanado.711 McReynolds.699 Gladden.671 Reimer.647 PoloniaMore discussion --DCON formula:  ((NHS + NDP)/PA) + ((NHS + NDP + NEB)/AB)Why such a bizzare formula?

This is hardly possible, as the majority of people in the world wereborn, lived their life, and died, without ever knowing anything aboutChrist.  The majority of the rest of the world have decided that he is not who Emery thinks he is./(emery)/Why were the writers of the New Testament documents so convinced that/Jesus really did rise from the dead?/We have four gospel accounts.  I am leaving out all ""proofs"" of Emery's which rely on quoting thebible as proof.  Circular reasoning, etc.  There have been occasionsalready stated many times for later generations of Xtians to change,edit, or otherwise alter the bible to fit their political gospel.And if we accept the bible as true just because the bible says itis true, then (to be fair) we have to do the same to the Bhagavad-Gitaand the Koran, both of which contradict the bible.Enough said./(emery)/Yet we have no reason to believe these disciples to be immoral and dishonest./We have no historic information that would lead us to the conclusion that/these people were not God-fearing people who sincerely and whole-heartedly/believed that the resurrection of their Lord Jesus was a real event./And for what gain would they lie?  To make a stand at that time meant /persecution, imprisonment, and perhaps even death.Again, this is only the biblical account and there is no independent proofof any of this happening.  It just isn't there.Besides, simply being sincere or willing to die for your faith does notmake your faith correct.  There are Muslims dying in Bosnia right now;does the fact that they are willing to die for Islam mean that Islam isthe correct religion?(emery)/History bears out the persecution of Christians.  Roman historian, Cornelius /Tacitus, Govenor of Asia, in A.D. 112, writing of Nero's reign, alluded to /the torture of Christians in Rome:All you have proven is that these people were tortured for their faith.  Thatdoes not prove that their faith is true or correct; it just means that theywere sincere in their beliefs. Being willing to die for what you believe doesn't make your belief the truth.It's not that easy.  And minority religions have always suffered torture;Muslims suffer torture and harassment in India and Bosnia today.  All religionsare harassed in China today.  You haven't proven anything so far./(emery)/With all the suffering and persecution that it meant to be a believer, it/would be quite probable that at least one of those in the supposed conspiracy/would come forward and confess that the whole thing was a big hoax.  Not if they didn't believe that it was a hoax.  /(emery)/Yet not one did.  It seems rather reasonable that the disciples did not make/up the resurrection but sincerely believed that Jesus had actually risen/from the dead; especially in light of the sufferings that came upon those/who believed.The followers of Muhammad firmly believed in the miracles that the Koransays Muhammad performed.  They were attacked and slaughtered for theirbeliefs.  They didn't denounce Muhammad or Islam.  If you are correct,then that means Islam is the true faith.You see how stupid your proofs are?"	talk.religion.misc

Evena little child will rebelliously stick his finger in a light socket.Even a little child will not want his diaper changed.  Even a littlechild will fight nap-time.So far as Jesus saying ""everyone"":      A certain ruler asked Jesus, ""Good teacher, what must I do to    inherit eternal life?""    ""Why do you call me good?""  Jesus answered.  ""No one is good--    except God alone.""Ken, the book of Romans states that we are born sinners.  We donot grow into being a sinner.  We sin because we are sinners.  Thecommon mistake, even in Christian circles, is to think the reversetrue.    So for as surely as you grew to look like you parents,you not only inherited their appearance, but also their sin nature.It goes with being human. Even though a new-born is innocent as can be, his sinful naturewill surely manifest itself more explicity as he gets older.  Foras surely as he grows hair on his head and teeth within his mouth,he will show the signs of his innate sin by rebellingagainst mommy and daddy with that loud proclamation ""No."""	talk.religion.misc

(Much thanks to Jayne K who isalready supporting me with kind words and prayers!)I've been working at this company for eight years in variousengineering jobs.  I'm female.  Yesterday I counted and realized thaton seven different occasions I've been sexually harrassed at thiscompany.  Seven times. Eight years. Yesterday was the most recent one;someone left an X-rated photo of a nude woman in my desk drawer.I'm really upset by this.  I suppose it could have been worse -- itcould have been a man having sex with a sheep or something.There was no note.  I do not know if it was:	- someone's idea of an innocent joke, that went awry	- someone's sick idea of flirting	- an act of emotional terrorism (that worked!)I dreaded coming back to work today.  What if my boss comes in to askme some kind of question, I don't know the answer so I take a militaryspecification down off from my shelf to look up the answer, and outfalls a picture of a man having sex with a sheep?  I generally have aBible on my desk for occasional inspiration; what if I open it up toCorinthians and find a picture a la the North American Man Boy LoveAssociation?  I want to throw up just thinking about this stuff.I can lock up my desk, but I can't lock up every book I have in theoffice.  I can't trust that someone won't shove something into mybriefcase or my coat pocket when I'm not looking so that I go home tofind such a picture, or a threat, or a raunchy note about what someonewants to do to my body.To make it worse, the entire department went out to lunch yesterday totreat our marvelous secretary to lunch.  The appointed hour forleaving was 11:30.  I was working in another building but wanted to goto the lunch.  So I returned at 11:25, only to find that ever singleperson had already left for lunch.  They left at 11:15 or so.  No onecould be bothered to call me at the other building, even though mynumber was posted.  So, I came back to a department that looked like aneutron bomb had gone off and I was the sole survivor.

Please pray that I can find a new jobin a place where the corporate culture does its best to prevent suchharrassment from happening in the first place, and swiftly actsappropriately when something occurs despite its best precautions.

Thanks in advance!Rich,	First of all you might want to join the VetteNet (vettes@chiller.compaq	.com)  during your search/acquisition of the 67.  $20k sounds about 	right for a wrong engine, condition 3 car.  This means that the car may	not have significant investment value but could be an excellent driver	and or hobby car.  You will also want to get a copy of the Corvette	Black Book immediately.  Don't leave home (to look at Vettes) without it.	Since you are contemplating spending >$20k, you might want to invest a	few hours in reading the ""Corvette Buyer's Guide"" and purchase Noland	Adams' tape ""How to Buy a Corvette.""  The tape shows you how to check	for damage, etc..  There are many many factors that will affect the	value, road worthiness, and repair expense of your proposed 67.  The	list is much too long to go into here.  Join the VetteNet where	there are over 100 current Corvette owners (many with 60s vintage	vettes) that are available to help you.  The pubs I mentioned above	are available from Mid-America Designs (800) 637-5533 and several	other Corvette parts sources.  Good luck!!!		Tom   ('68 327/350hp - '79 Cruiser)"	rec.autos

I'm serious; Itend to agree with David that bringing the player up sooner is better, butI'd like to look at players for whom this theory didn't work, if there areany.  I'd prefer players within the last 10 years or so, because then I canlook up their minor league stats.  (It's important to distinguish betweenplayers who legitimately had careers below what their minor league numberswould have projected, as opposed to players who were hyped and failed, butactually had careers not out of line with their minor league numbers).  Let's kick it off with an example of a player who was ""rushed"", althoughthere doesn't seem to have been any damage to his career.  Jay Bell wasgiven 135 PAs in the major leagues at age 21, and performed well below whatyou would expect from his AAA numbers the same season.  He got 236 PAs thenext year at age 22, and still underperformed.  However, the next year, atage 24, his performance improved, and he won the everyday shortstop job,and has been there ever since.  It's really hard for me to see where hewould have been better off staying in the minor league (where he wasperformed quite well in AAA) during this time, rather than being ""rushed"";Cleveland might have been better off, I suppose, because they might havebeen less likely to give up on him.Yes, if you bring a player up early, he's likely going to struggle.  Butdoes that delay the time at which he stops struggling, and startsperforming up to expectations?Sherri Nicholssnichols@adobe.com"	rec.sport.baseball

I stated that psychotherapy (meaning talking therapy and so on) was used     to treat Obsessive Compulsive Disorder, which though sometimes true is     misleading.  It is not often found effective, particularly by itself.    Primary treatment today usually consists at least in part of drug    therapy.  The most current theories of this condition attribute     it to more to biological causes than psychological, in places where this    distinction becomes important.2.  I mentioned that the DSM-IIIR mentions 'impulses' as a possible 	diagnostic marker.  However, this might look like something	people associate with psychotic conditions, uncontrollable or	unpredictable behaviors, which is NOT the case with OCD.  	One of the diagnostic criteria of OCD is that the individual	can and does suppress some of their 'impulses,' although they	are an unending source of anxiety.  	The obsessive thoughts and ritualistic actions usually associated with 	OCD are most frequently very mundane and predictable, closer to	a superstitious nature than a dangerous nature for the most part.

It was six runs in the 8th for a 12-5 win Monday and five inthe 8th and six in the 9th for a 12-2 win yesterday. Jamie Navarro pitchedseven strong innings, but Orosco, Austin, Manzanillo and Lloyd all took partin the mockery of a bullpen yesterday. How's this for numbers? Maldanado haspitched three scoreless innings and Navarro's ERA is 0.75. The next loweston the staff is Wegman at 5.14. Ouch!It doesn't look much better for the hitters. Hamilton is batting .481, whileThon is hitting .458 and has seven RBI. The next highest is three. The nextbest hitter is Jaha at .267 and then Vaughn, who has the team's only HR, at.238. Another ouch. Looking at the stats, it's not hard to see why the teamis 2-5. In fact, 2-5 doesn't sound bad when you're averaging three runs/gameand giving up 6.6/game. Still, it's early and things will undoubtedly get better. The offense shouldcome around, but the bullpen is a major worry. Fetters, Plesac and Austin gavethe Brewers great middle relief last year. Lloyd, Maldanado, Manzanillo, Fetters, Austin and Orosco will have to pick up the pace for the team to besuccessful. Milwaukee won a number of games last year when middle relief eitherheld small leads or kept small deficits in place. The starters will be okay,the defense will be alright and the hitting will come around, but the bullpenis a big question mark.In other news, Nilsson and Doran were reactivated yesterday, while WilliamSuero was sent down and Tim McIntosh was picked up by Montreal.

Maintaining a `just friends' level of relationship is much easier said than done.  People usually end up getting hurt.  This is especially likely to happen when they start off with feelings of attraction.  When people feel attracted those feelings can cloud their judgement.  I've had the experience of going quickly from believing that I shouldn't date non-Christians to believing that dating this man would be okay to believing that premarital sex is fine when people really love each other.  When the relationship ended my beliefs immediately returned to their original state.  This is an especially extreme case because I was young and away from home and fellowship.  I don't think it would work exactly this way for most people.  However, it's important not to underestimate the power of feelings of attraction.

An On/Off Road Rally consists of the following:   1. An on-the-road rally where participants are given a set of      directions and clues guiding participates around the       Joliet/Plainfield area.  The object is to navigate a course      based on a set of directions and clues.  Participants will      be given a set of questions pertaining to the course which      they must answer along the way.  Points are awarded for the      number of correct answers given.  Directions will ultimately       lead to an off-road area where a four-wheel drive course is       set-up.  At various locations in the on-road course, check-points      will be set-up where participants will be asked other questions      or requested to perform some activity (e.g. tire roll, truck tow,      basketball free-throw, etc.) for additional points.   2. An optional off-road, four wheel drive course where participants      will navigate off-road trails, mud bogs and/or hill climbs.      Points are awarded for successfully navigating off-road obstacles      without getting stuck.  If you should get stuck (which is half      the fun anyway), there will be assistance to get your vehicle      unstuck so you can try it again.  The off-road course will      divided up based on tire size, so stock 4x4s as well as modified      4x4s can run the course.       At the end of the rally, trophies will be awarded to top scoring  participants.  Door prizes and dash plaques will also be given out.  Food and drinks also available at the conclusion.* This is an organized activity sponsored by the Joliet Mud Turtles  so safety and fun is our foremost concern.  All 4x4s must be  street legal and have solid tow points for the off-road section  of the course - we don't want to have to separate someone's bumper  from their vehicle :) .The Particulars:* Rally begins at Instant Replay, 2409 Plainfield Road, Joliet Il.    (815)436-9382   (see map below)* Registration is between 9 and 10:30 a.m.  First truck out at 10:00 a.m.* Rally date is Sunday April 25th, rain or shine* There is an entry fee of $10 per truck.* You must have a co-driver (passengers allowed)* A valid drivers license is required* Suggested equipment:      CB Radio      Compass      Tow Strap and Clevis      Clip Board and Pencil* No alcohol during rally* For more information contact   Gary (815)727-3415   Tom  (815)485-9346   Norm Jr. (815)741-4853   Brian (708)979-6083                                            __              Instant                      /\      |       Replay |             |         \      | 1.9mi  ___   | 1.2 mi      |        North      |<----->|   | <------------> | Rt30 |       |___|  |             |------|--------------------------------------------- Exit |              |             |         ^ 257  |              |             |         |      |              |             |         |      |Rt55          |Canton       |Larkin   |      |              |Farm         |Ave      |      |              |Rd.          |         | 3 mi.      |              |             |         |      |              |             |         |      |                            |         |      |                            |         |      |       Rt80                 |         v----------------------------------------------------      |                            | Exit      |                            | 130B      |                            |"	rec.autos

Being me, of course, Iused equivalent averages to work out how many runs a player was worth,and I calculated both rate of performance (fielding equivalentaverage) and total performance (fielding equivalent runs). But Icompared, not to the average player, but the replacement player, andhere's why: because the positional adjustment comes built in to thesystem. In the AL of 1992, the average SS is 32.9 runs abovereplacement (RAR); cf, 31.6; 2B, 28.8; 3B, 26.3; LF, 26.0; RF, 24.6;1B, 16.9. We may quibble with the exact numbers, but the order lookssubstantially right.In the equivalent average, I have always set league average to .235. Ihad decided in hitting that the replacement level batter has an eqa of.180; the name of that replacement level hitter, often as not, is""Billy Ripken"". I decided to let the replacement level fielder be thesame distance from .235 as .180, but in the opposite direction as Ihave set it up; that makes for an eqa of .280. (Yes, I can add. Runsare proportional to eqa squared; the difference between 180 squaredand 235 squared equals the difference to 279 squared, and I roundedoff for simplicity). An all-replacement fielding team would have:Randy Milligan at first (.282), Willie Randolph (.269) at second, LeoGomez (.279) at third, Walt Weiss (.269) at short, Kevin Bass (.271)in left, HoJo (.257) in center, and Eric Anthony (.277) in right. Ugh.So, the total number of RAR for a player is the sum of his batting andfielding RAR. I can rate them by total RAR, or RAR per some number ofbatting outs, like 400. An average player has a total RAR of about 55,30 batting, 25 fielding.Total RAR (bat/field)1. Bonds      152 (124/28)  Ventura    124 (66/58)2. Sandberg   143 (88/55)   Thomas     122 (110/12)3.

If they neededto assault a place they could just do like the IRS does...call in thefederal marshalls service, their fugitive collection teams do similar typeassaults all the time.

In terms of examples, there is some danger of beginning to quibbleover what a ""surprising"" experiment is, what counts as ""surprising"", etc.The same may be said about ""logical grounds"".  My point is that quite frequently(perhaps even most frequently) the roots of a new theory can be traced topreviously existing theories (or even to previously rejected hypotheses ofsome other theory or domain).  I would offer some rather well known examplessuch as Toricelli's Puy de Dome experiment done for the sake of his ""sea of air""hypothesis.  Was this theory (and the resulting experimental test) ""surprising""?Well, given the *prior* explanations of the phenomena involved it certainly mustbe counted as so.  Was the theory constructed (and the experiment designed)out of ""perfectly rational grounds""?  Well, there was a pretty successful andwell know theory of fluids.  The analogy to fluids by Toricelli is explicit.The novelty was in thinking of air as a fluid (but this was *quite* a noveltyat the time).  Was the theory interesting?  Yes.  Was it ""new""?  Well, onecould argue that it was merely the extension of an existing theory to a newdomain, but I think this begs certain questions.  We can debate that if youlike.-- Gary H.

An Armenian legion was organized 'to expel the Turks from the entire southern shore of the lake in preparation for a concerted Russian drive into the Bitlis vilayet.'[162] Thousands of Armenians from Mus and other major centers in the east began to flood into the new  Armenian state...By mid-July there were as many as 250,000 Armenians crowded into the Van area, which before the crisis had housed and fed no more than 50,000 people, Muslim and non-Muslim alike.[163]""[162] Hovannisian, ""Road to Independence,"" p. 56; FOP 2488, nos. 127223 and58350.[163] BVA, Meclis-i Vukela Mazbatalari, debates of August 15-17, 1915; Babi-i Ali Evrak Odasi, no. 175, 321, ""Van Ihtilali ve Katl-i Ami,""Zilkade 1333/10 September 1915.>As you point out above, the original quote used the term ``Tartars,''>as distinct from ``Turks,'' but you perhaps feel free to make these>minor adjustments in the name of truth.I went through this just a few weeks ago; here it comes again. The entire Turkish population of Armenia (which Armenians called Tartars) constituted at least about 40% of the total population of Armenia was deliberately exterminated. (For the population statistics, please look to the book of Richard Hovannessian, ""Armenia on the Road to Independence."") I listed three books earlier of such a monstrous crime by the writings of one Armenian, one American, and one British. They are: ""Men Are Like That"" by Leonard R. Hartill; ""Adventures in the Near East"" by A. Rawlinson; ""World Alive, A Personal Story"" by Robert Dunn. Also, I personally have copies of documents of this crime by the writings of two Armenians and also one American. The official British report about this massacre mentioned in one of these documents (Lord Curzon-Aharonin interview) is the report of the British High Commissioner to Caucasia, Sir Oliver Wardrop.""An appropriate analogy with the Jewish Holocaust might be the systematic extermination of the entire Muslim population of  the independent republic of Armenia which consisted of at  least 30-40 percent of the population of that republic.

You can adjustit to be sensitive enough that there is no way you could open the hood withoutsetting off the alarm.  Although, I know that you cannot pop the hood on theSyclone without setting off my alarm now, and yet I have had zero (none!) falsealarms with this system.  The alarm tells you when you disarm it whether it hasbeen activated in your absence.  I have been able to trace every alarm to it'scause and it was not a false alarm.> > I'm also wondering how easy it would be for a thief to crawl> underneath the car and cut the battery cable to disable the alarm.> I guess it would be possible depending on the vehicle.  My Syclone is so tightin the engine compartment that it would be tough to do this.  There aresupplemental power supplies you can put on with this Viper alarm, but I don'thave one.  I really think that if someone wants my car that bad, the alarmwon't keep them from it, even with a supplemental power supply.> Viper also sells some fancy field disturbance sensor that> supposedly detects people approcahing the car....> This is primarily for convertibles.  I have a convertible and have looked atthis feature in detail.  Alpine actually makes a better radar unit if you wantto get one of these.  It has zones in it that can be shut down independently sothat if one side of your car has pedestrian traffic or something else thatwould trigger an alarm, it shuts down the zone, or rather, pulls it in tighter.I don't see the real benefit to these unless you have a convertible that youleave the top down on.Avoid the voice alarm that can be added to the radar package.  It talks topeople as they walk by.  I saw one installed on a Lotus Esprit.  The kids wouldtaunt it seeing how close they could get before it 'warned' them to get back. The owner finally disabled it, which defeats the purpose in my mind.> > I'm interested in the opinions of you netters about these problems> and about the viper in general.> I am real happy with my Viper.  One other feature I really like is you can tuneit to your preferences.  You can have it arm passively or not.  You can disablethe chirp for arming/disarming.  You can have it lock/unlock the doors when thealarm is armed/disarmed.  I like these features.  I hate the chirp when the alarm arms/disarms, so mineflashes the lights only.  I like the door lock feature, although I have to becareful to take my keys with me because it doesn't know if you have left yourkeys in the car when it passively arms and locks the doors.  But, if you aremeticulous about taking your keys with you, it takes care of the rest.> The car is an 89 Ford Probe GT that used to be in great shape!> > > Ron Garnett> I looked seriously at the Alpine system too.  It is a real nice system, butmore money and it has a motion sensor standard instead of the shock sensor. The shock sensor is better....and the Viper shock sensor is better (2 cycle)than the optional Alpine one, IMHO.  I think the Viper gives you a lot of goodvalue for the money.  But it isn't absolutely tamperproof.  No system is. Except maybe the one that James Bond had on his Lotus in For Your Eyes Only. Anyone know where we can get one of those installed?

Although this case did not pertain to firearms, Justice Rhenquist    notes that the term ""the people"" is a term of art conveying individual    rights, and specifically cited several used, 2nd ammentment included,    in his opinion.  - Title 10, U.S. Code.  This states that all males between the ages of    18 & 45 not part of the organized militia, and all female officers of    the national guard are part of the unorganized militia.Feel free to cite any scholarly and historical references you have tosupport your position.

It's like this.  We *are* footing the bill.  Maybe they willtake choice A.  Maybe they will take choice B.  Maybe they will take choiceC.  They can't afford any *one* of them.  If they take choice A we'd haveto pay them, say $5.  If they take choice B it would cost us $20.  If theytake choice C it will cost us $20 now and a hell of a lot more for the next18 years.  Which one sounds the most realistic for us to be willing to payfor?  Now some people happen not to like choice A.  Other people happennot to like choice C (paying for it, that is).  C has been around and paidfor for years.  Even though it means we spend a lot of money, we can't inconscience refuse to pay for it.  Now A has been around and is perfectlylegal, but it hasn't been funded in the past.  Now A is going to be fundedbut some people object.  They don't like the idea of their tax money goingto pay for choice A.  So we could refuse to fund A at all.  Then thosewomen who can't afford any of those choices will be forced to take choiceB or C, which will cost *all of us* more money.  Most of us don't see anyreason at all why *more money* should be spent to the effect of *removingpersonal choice* from some women.  The alternative is to fund A if that iswhat the mother chooses.  We will also still fund B and even C if *that*is what the mother chooses.  However, some women will certainly choose A,and that will then save us $15 we otherwise would have had to spend.

He defines sexuality by behavior, not by > orientation, and ranked all persons on a scale from Zero (completely > heterosexual) to 6 (completely heterosexual).It seems one or the other end of the rating scale should be identified with ""homosexual"".As a personal note, I guess I differ with you on the question of work entering human life as a result of sin.  > Note that in the > creation story work enters human life as a result of sin. Before the fall (Gen 2:15) ""And the LORD God took the man, and put him into the garden of Eden to dress it and to keep it."" which I would call ""work"".  For me, the difference introduced by sin is the painful aspects of work added at the fall (I take the cursing of the ground in vs.17-19 to apply to the work for sustenance).  In a way, some view ""work"" as a blessing (Ecclesiastes is a fun book! - for melancholies).I hope I do not sound caustic, maybe you can enlighten me further.Well, this is certainly a delicate subject, and I guess you accomplished what you state as your purpose ""It summarizes arguments for allowing Christian homosexuality"", not for me the most noble goal, but you are writing a FAQ.I wonder if you might temporize the apparent ""sentence"" of the specific homosexual you propose (arguably tenuously define).> The danger in advising Christians to> depend upon such a change is clear: When ""conversion"" doesn't happen,> which is almost always, the people are often left in despair, feeling> excluded from a Church that has nothing more to say but a requirement> of life-long celibacy.   Perhaps that would be true of ""celibacy from homosexual relations"", or refrainng from their choice relationships, but that does not forbid heterosexual.  Could they not have/enjoy heterosexual relations ""for what it was worth""? [This depends upon the person.  In some cases I think the answer isno.  Even with those who could, consider what you're asking.  I assumewe're talking about marriage -- I certainly would not want to suggestsex outside that.  You're talking about a permanent commitment to akind of sexual relationship that they aren't really sure they can livewith.  There may be people for whom this is a possible solution, but Iwonder whether it's entirely fair to the other partner.  I have acousin who was a victim of exactly this situation.  We found out later(after her death) that her husband had had problems with his sexualidentity.  His family (conservative Christians) knew it, and pushedhim into getting married.  He continued having problems, and they werenear divorce.  She died in an accident whose circumstances some of therelatives consider odd.  He has since had a sex change operation, andhas been moving around from state to state without being able to holda job, keeping their children in a kind of home life both sets ofgrandparents consider irresponsible.  I hope you can understand why Iam not enthusiastic about pushing homosexuals into marriage.  I reallyliked my cousin.  This is sort of an emotional issue for me.  Again,it may be possible for some, but this is the sort of situation thatneeds to be dealt with pastorally and not as a matter of fixedideology.  --clh]"	soc.religion.christian

Women Athletes, TLP Win Sex Discrimination Ruling: Brown UniversityOrdered to Restore Two Women's Varsity TeamsTo: National Desk, Sports Writer Contact: Lynette Labinger, 401-421-9794, home 401-274-7507, or          Ray Marcaccio, 401-831-8900, both of Trial Lawyers For          Public Justice   WASHINGTON, April 16 -- The U.S. Court of Appealsfor the First Circuit in Boston has upheld a U.S. District Courtorder requiring Brown University to immediately reinstate its women'sgymnastics and volleyball teams to full varsity status. The ruling inCohen et al. v. Brown University is the first appeals court decisionin the nation applying Title IX to intercollegiate athletics.  TrialLawyers for Public Justice (TLPJ), is the national public interestlaw firm representing the women athletes.   ""This ruling makes clear what we have said all along -- if aschool wants to eliminate teams before women have their fair share ofopportunities to participate, they can only eliminiate men's teams,""said TLPJ Executive Director Arthur Bryant, co-counsel in the case.   The class action, filed April, 1992, charged Brown with violatingTitle IX of the Education Amendments of 1972, the federal law thatprohibits sex discrimination by all educational institutionsreceiving federal funds.  Brown terminated the two women's teams asuniversity-funded sports in May 1991, allowing them to continue tocompete against varsity teams if they could raise their own funds foruniforms, travel, coaches, and all other expenses.  They had alsobeen denied admission preferences for use in recruiting new members.   ""This is a major victory for women and the cause of equal rights,""said TLPJ lead counsel Lynette Labinger of Providence's Roney &Labinger.  ""Universities across America need to reevaluate theirprograms quickly. Title IX is the law and it's going to be enforced.""   Three similar Title IX appeals await decision.  Colorado StateUniversity, Indiana University of Pennsylvania (IUP), and ColgateUniversity are asking federal appeals courts to overturn court ordersrequiring them to reinstate or establish specific women's varsityteams.  Continuing its cutting-edge Title IX activities, TLPJ isrepresenting women athletes at IUP.   In addition to Labinger and Bryant, TLPJ's legal team included:Ray Marcaccio of Blish & Cavanagh and Amato DeLuca of Mandell, DeLuca& Schwartz in Providence; and Sandra Duggan of Philadelphia.  TheNational Women's Law Center, Women's Sports Foundation, and NationalAssociation for Girls and Women in Sports filed an amicus brief insupport of TLPJ's appeal. -30-"	rec.sport.hockey

Your Xlib implementation probably definesCopyFromParent as zero, to simplify the conversion to wire format, soyou are unwittingly asking for a border width of zero, due to the Xlibimplementation not providing stricter type-checking.

Response welcomed.: : PS.  my initial question is ""how do you seset the service indicator of a BMW"": : Derek There is a perfectly legal tool available to reset the Bimmer service lights.It will cost you 45$ from a mailorder, and buying one far outweighsthe possible consequences of destroying all the electronics if you trydi it yourself. You wonder how people do an oil change without knowing how it reset.Why is reseting so important? The only reason for doingit is stop the annoyance of a red light staring at you. Forget this 'in european cars you only need to change the oil every15000' crap. Anyone serious about keeping their engine in good shape, andextending its life, will change it every 3000, (inc filter). Don't waitfor the servive lights to come on before servicing the car. I bought a bmw about 6 months ago, it had 3 green lights on. I have changedthe oil every 3000, completly flushed brake fliud, changed all filters(oil,air and fuel, changed transmission and drive oilsand done almost all of the other things req for service 1and a service 2. After nearly 6000 miles, I am still on 2 green lights.After a winter in Burlington (and it is snowing today!!) that is not bad.Good luck!

I wasraised as a Unitarian and have spent the better part of my life as anagnostic, but recently I have developed the firm conviction that theChristian message is correct and I have accepted Jesus into my life. I amhappy, but I realize I am very ignorant about much of the Bible andquite possibly about what Christians should hold as true. This I am tryingto rectify (by reading the Bible of course), but it would be helpfulto also read a good interpretation/commentary on the Bible or otherrelevant aspects of the Christian faith. One of my questions I wouldlike to ask is - Can anyone recommend a good reading list of theologicalworks intended for a lay person?I have another question I would like to ask. I am not yet affiliatedwith any one congregation. Aside from matters of taste, what criteriashould one use in choosing a church? I don't really know the differencebetween the various Protestant denominations.Thanks for reading my post. Sincerely,Steve Hoskins[Aside from a commentary, you might also want to consider anintroduction.  These are books intended for use in undergraduate Biblecourses.  They give historical background, discussion of literarystyles, etc.  And generally they have good bibligraphies for furtherreading.  I typically recommend Kee, Froehlich and Young's NTintroduction.  There are also some good one-volume commentaries.  Theyoften have background articles that are helpful.  Probably the bestrecommendation these days would be Harper's Bible Commentary.  (Ithink there may be a couple of books with this title.  This is afairly recent one, like about 1990, done in cooperation with theSociety for Biblical Criticism.)  If you are committed to inerrancy,you will probably prefer something more conservative.  I don't read alot of conservative books, but a commentary I looked at by DonaldGuthrie looked rather good.  He has a NT Introduction, and he's alsoeditor of Eerdman's Bible Commentary.  --clh]	soc.religion.christian

Try turning offall lights in the room(s) around the system and see if that helps.

Mahan) says:>Could someone explain how to make sense of drag coefficients (i.e Cd) mentioned in magazines.  I understand that lower numbers signify better aerodynamics but>what does this mean in the real world.  Is there a way to calculate new top speeds(assuming the car is not rev limited at top speed) or mileage benefits if a identical car had the Cd reduced from .34 to .33.It's pretty complex, and Cd isn't the whole story either.  Cd for cars isusually calculated based on the frontal area of the car.  So a large carwith a good Cd could get the same drag force as a smaller car with apoorer Cd. To calculate drag use this formula:D = 1/2 * rho * v^2 * Cd * SWhere D is the drag force (lbs), rho is the local air density (slugs/ft^3),V is the velocity (ft/s), and S is the frontal area (ft^2).  Note that thepieces called 1/2 * rho * v^2 are sometimes called qbar or dynamic pressure(a fancy aero term for air pressure or force). Note that power is:P = F * vWhere P is power (lbf-ft/s), F is the force, drag in this case (lbf) and vis velocity (ft/s). Note that if you put the whole equation into one (by substituting D forforce) you get a velocity _cubed_ term.  That's why huge increases in powerresult in little increases in speed.  Ditto for decreases in Cd. So if you have a 100 mph car and reduce Cd from .34 to .33, your new topspeed is:  (sound of trumpet fanfare)101 mphSorry to dissappoint.-- Al Bowers  DOD #900  Alfa  Ducati  Hobie  Kottke  'blad  Iaido  NASA""Well goodness sakes...don't you know that girls can't play guitar?""                                             -Mary Chapin-Carpenter"	rec.autos

In v. 4 he stated that theadoption, the glory, the covenants, the giving of the law, the service ofGod, and the promises were given to the Israelites.  It is a package deal. He goes on to identify those who are true Israelites.  Vs 6-8 makes itplain that the true Israelites are not those who are born that way butthose who accept the promise of God.  Paul continued to emphasize that hewas an Israelite in 2 Cor. 11:22, then in Gal 3:29 he says that all thosewho belong to Christ are Abraham's seed, and heirs to all the promisesgiven to the Israelites.  The promises come with the law.  It is all ornothing.  Why is it that you only want to discard one part of the law? Certainly you would want your husband to be faithful to you.  Or do youbelieve that adultery is no longer forbidden?  Same law.BTW  please give a reference for your statement that the Gentiles are onlyrequired to observe the basis commandmants.

After comparing the above strings with my AT commands reference guide, Icame up with:ATZ0L2N2X5&D0S11=50^MThis is entered in the 'Initialize' box on the 'Modem Preferences' in Zterm.Quick summary of each commmand:Z0	- Reset modem to User Profile 0.L2	- Speaker volume at 2 (fairly quiet)N2	- Ring volume at 2 (fairly quiet)X5	- Display connect info according to setting 5 (see manual)&D0	- Assume DTR (computer) is always onS11=50	- Dial speed at 50 (as fast as ZyXEL can handle)In FirstClass, I used this same string, with the addition of S0=0 rightbefore the S11 command, in the setup box.  This disables the auto-answer function of the modem for FirstClass.  I based my modem setting on the Supra14.4FAX, and just changed the above mentioned string.In Telefinder, I based my setting on the Zoom V42 - HH setting.  I changedthe 'Modem Initialization' string to the same one I used for FirstClass, andeverything seems to work fine.Sorry it took so long to get this summary out.

"Newsgroup:talk.politics.gunsdocument_id: 54829From: allanh@sco.COM (Allan J. Heim)Subject: Re: Ban All Firearms !jrm@gnv.ifas.ufl.edu:   Firearms tend to fall into this low dollar/pound area.  It would not   be economic to smuggle them in.  All production would have to be   local.  There are not all that many people who have both the skill   AND motivation to assemble worthwhile firearms from scratch.   High-ranking crime figures could obtain imported Uzis and such, but   the average person, and average thug, would be lucky to get a zip-gun   - and would pay through the nose for it.Good point you make.  However, a zip gun, by definition, is a crude,homemade gun--certainly not something capable of sustained, accuratefire, but it would be useful as a means of getting a normal gun.  Recallthe tiny, single-shot pistols made by the Allies during World War II foruse by partisans.  They were essentially well-made zipguns, incapable ofeffective fire beyond a few feet.  But they were useful as a means ofkilling German soldiers for their guns.Also note that the crowd-pleasin' favorite, the Sten gun, wasspecifically designed to require as little machine work as possible.The point's been made here that one could make a Sten clone with steeltubing, hand tools and a welder.I still think that while the point is good, I think there's a differencebetween marijuana and firearms, in that quality marijuana can be grownlocally; there's no need to import the stuff.  If guns are banned, Ithink the demand for ""real"" guns will be sufficient to make smugglingeconomically feasible, thus rendering a ban moot.  In any case, theresult would be the same--people who aren't criminals won't havefirearms, and ""bad guys"" will continue to have access to them, one wayor another.  And I don't see that as a necessary situation.-- Allan J. Heim   allanh@sco.COM   ...!uunet!sco!allanh   +1 408 427 7813"	talk.politics.guns

That's why the use of the 10K 5W resistorhere to add extra current thru the blinker to make up for thecurrent shunted thru the second string while the blinker is glowingand the second string is not glowing.  When the blinker goes open,this resistor has only a slight effect on the brightness of thestrings, s1 slightly dimmer, s2 slightly brighter.  Or use a 3W 120v bulb in place of the 10K resistor if you can getone.  Caution, do not replace with a standard C9 bulb, as thesedraw too much current and burn out the blinker.  C9 = approx 7W.What you'll see when it's working:  powerup, string 1 will light at full brightness, and b will be lit, bypassing most of the current from the second string, making them not light.  b will open, placing both strings in series, making the string that was out to glow at a low brightness, and the other string that was on before to glow at reduced brightness. Be sure to wire and insulate the splices, resistor leads, and cut wires in a safe manner!	sci.electronics

People seem perfectly capable	dealing with these others.  Dealing with the format of TIFF	is frankly less difficult than dealing with the DCT, LZW, and	FAX encoding of the image data.  The majority of the libraries	which deal with TIFF are dedicated to these other issues rather	than with simply decoding the tags and parameters.	Perhaps people are overwhelmed in comparison with some rather	simpleminded formats such as GIF, PCX, and BMP, but to suggest	that TIFF is so complex as to be doomed to failure is ludicrous.	That doesn't mean that GIF isn't fine, but don't even thing about	using it in many instances.  GIF is very nice for use in low-end	photos applications and for screen grabs and such, but it would	never do for high-volume or high-resolution systems.  FAX is nice,	but it doesn't do color (and GIF doesn't do B&W all that well).	JPEG is nice for high-resolution color, but is slow for low-end.	The advantage TIFF brings to the table is its ability to handle	all these situations (and then some).  Naturally it's more complex.	But I'ld rather propose TIFF imaging solutions over imaging	systems based on having to deal with 3-4 file formats anyday.	You may find that TIFF is too complicated for your personal tastes	but please don't wrail against it's complexity.  The complexity	it contains is required to provide the functionality it does and	doesn't come close to the complexity found in most commercially	viable file formats.	If we're in philosophical arguments against complexity, let's all	go program in scheme and forth and do imaging with run length	encoding."	comp.graphics

Newsgroup:sci.electronicsdocument_id: 53764From: kubovich@iastate.edu (Mark W Kubovich)Subject: Common-mode noise and small signalsI have never worked with really small signals before and have a few questions about low level noise.  I have noticed that the waveform synthesizer that I am using (Analogic 2020) has some relatively largecommon mode noise on it.  I am using this synthesizer to 'null' out anothertransient waveform and am amplifying the difference (~200uV) several hundred times.  The 2020 has about 1-3 mVp-p of common mode noise and this tends tomake my measurements hard to repeat.  (The noise is not quite in sync with line frequency, and on a spectrum analyzer, the main component is about 64Hz).How can I get rid of the noise?  When I look at the spectrum using anHP 3582A (audio range analyzer), the noise goes away the minute I switch to 'isolation' on the input.  I am guessing the anlayzer has a diff amp on the input since it will read accurately down to DC.Also, if I use a differential amplifier (IA) to solve the problem, how important is it to use one of these 'shield drivers' (an amp connected to the shield in sort of a feedback loop to remove trouble caused by different cable capacitances)?  If anyone can suggest a good IC IA for use with transient signals with content from 1KHz to about 300KHz, I wouldappreciate it.	sci.electronics

Dick Dick wrote many philosophical and thought-provoking short stories and novels.  His stories are bizarre at times, but very approachable.He wrote mainly SF, but he wrote about people, truth and religion rather thantechnology.  Although he often believed that he had met some sort of God, heremained sceptical.  Amongst his novels, the following are of some relevance:""Galactic Pot-Healer""A fallible alien deity summons a group of Earth craftsmen and women to aremote planet to raise a giant cathedral from beneath the oceans.

The book is the diary of a woman's life as she tries to liveunder the new Christian theocracy.  Women's right to own property is revoked,and their bank accounts are closed; sinful luxuries are outlawed, and theradio is only used for readings from the Bible.  Crimes are punishedretroactively: doctors who performed legal abortions in the ""old world"" arehunted down and hanged.

In thiswork, Swinburne attempts to construct a series of inductive arguments for theexistence of God.  His arguments, which are somewhat tendentious and relyupon the imputation of late 20th century western Christian values andaesthetics to a God which is supposedly as simple as can be conceived, weredecisively rejected in Mackie's ""The Miracle of Theism"".  In the revisededition of ""The Existence of God"", Swinburne includes an Appendix in which hemakes a somewhat incoherent attempt to rebut Mackie.J. L. MACKIE""The Miracle of Theism"", OxfordThis (posthumous) volume contains a comprehensive review of the principalarguments for and against the existence of God.  It ranges from the classicalphilosophical positions of Descartes, Anselm, Berkeley, Hume et al, throughthe moral arguments of Newman, Kant and Sidgwick, to the recent restatementsof the classical theses by Plantinga and Swinburne.  It also addresses thosepositions which push the concept of God beyond the realm of the rational,such as those of Kierkegaard, Kung and Philips, as well as ""replacements forGod"" such as Lelie's axiarchism.  The book is a delight to read - lessformalistic and better written than Martin's works, and refreshingly directwhen compared with the hand-waving of Swinburne.JAMES A.

But to suggest that a>*disease* is a *punishment* for certain types of sin I think is >taking things much too far.  [text deleted]>Yes, sin can have terrible consequences, but we need to be *real*>careful when saying that the consequences are a *punishment* for >sin.  I wish that you had followed this thread before jumping to conclusions.I haven't seen anybody write that AIDS was a *punishment* for certaintypes of sin (this includes Mark Ashley who you were responding tohere).  I myself wrote that when you don't do things God's way thatcurses will come on you and others.  Although one definition of 'curse'is 'retribution', I only meant 'harm or misfortune' when I used theword.  Because God loves us he has told us the best way to live in hisBible.  God doesn't cause curses, he warns us of them.Kevin Davis wrote (a while ago):>Last week I was guilty of anger, jealousy, and whole mess of>other stuff, yet I am forgiven and not condemned to suffer with>AIDs.  To even suggest that AIDS is ""deserved"" is ludicrous.The Bible makes it clear that we all equally deserve death (which ismuch worse than AIDS) -- we have all hurt God with our sin.Paul Conditt reveals his feelings:>In case you couldn't tell, I get *extremely* angry and upset when>I see things like this.  Instead of rationalizing our own fears and>phobias, we need to be reaching out to people with AIDS and other>socially unacceptable diseases.  Whether they got the disease through>their own actions or not is irrelevant.  They still need Jesus...The first issue you bring up is your anger.  It is ""obvious""ly wrong tobe angry (Gal 5:19-20) for any reason, especially *extremely* angrywhich is on par with hatred.  Jesus has every reason to be angry at usfor putting him on the cross with our sin, yet his prayer was ""forgivethem Father, they know not what they do.""  Knowing how forgiving Jesushas been with me calls me to be more forgiving with everyone out oflove for Him.  Please don't give in to anger, it will only causefoolish quarrels and more bad feelings.It's okay if you read something that bothers you, but you need toaddress it in a loving way.  If right now, I felt like someone outthere was saying that God punishes gay or sexually immoral people withAIDS because they deserve punishment that others don't then I wouldframe a response something like this:""It makes me feel very sad for someone to believe that AIDS, which issimply a harmful disease not so unlike any other, is God's punishmentfor people who have committed certain sins.  God loves all of hischildren equally and rejoices when a single one comes back to him.  Wewill all be judged after we die, but until then we all have theopportunity to accept God's grace by earnestly seeking after him withall of our hearts, believing the gospel's testimony, repenting of oursin, confessing that Jesus is Lord at baptism, and living a new lifefor him. Let us not judge someone to be eternally condemned.  God's arm is notto short to save.  He will do anything he can to move a hardened heartor a misled person.  He works for the good of all men.  Even throughthe worst of situations, he has set the times and places for all menthat they may perhaps reach out and find him.""The second issue you bring up is seeing people rationalize their fearsof people with AIDS.  Fortunately, what you describe as seeing isactually misperceiving.  You have been missing the points made in theearlier posts and reacting in anger to attitudes that haven't beenexpressed.  I know that its sometimes hard to discount yourperceptions, but please try to be open-minded.You are quite correct in saying that we should reach out to all peoplebecause they all need Jesus.  This is what my brothers and sisters andI do on a daily basis.  If you would like to send me the name of thecity and state you live in, I will find and get you in touch with somebrothers who have AIDS or know people with AIDS and live nearby you sothat you can see the loving attitudes for yourself.The third issue you bring up is the importance of how some individualcontracted AIDS.  How someone gets AIDS is only relevant to theirsalvation in that there may be repetence involved.The important point to be made, however, is that not listening to God'scommands (or advice or warnings), i.e. sinning, causes harm ormisfortune to yourself and others.  For this reason, a good way toprevent the misfortune of AIDS, which can be transmitted in sinful ways,is to listen to God's advice and have sex only with your wife orhusband.I hope that you are feeling better now, Paul.Love,Aaron Cardenas"	soc.religion.christian

Watson) asks: > What is the objection to celebration of Easter?        The objection naturally is in the way in which you phrase it. Easter (or Eashtar or Ishtar or Ishtarti or other spellings) is the paganwhore goddess of fertility.  Therefore, your question to me is ""what isthe objection to celebration of the pagan whore goddess?""  When phrasedthat way I suspect (or at least I would HOPE) that it becomes immeadiatelyapparent what my objection to ""celebrating"" her would be.  > It is celebration of the resurrection of Jesus.       No, you are thinking perhaps of ""Ressurection Sunday"" I think. (Though I'm not too crazy about the word ""Sunday"", but I certainly likethis phrasing much better than envoking the name of the whore goddess.)     For that matter, stay Biblical and call it Omar Rasheet (The Feast ofFirst Fruits).  Torah commands that this be observed on the day followingthe Sabbath of Passover week.  (Sunday by any other name in modernparlance.)  Why is there so much objection to observing the Resurrectionon the 1st day of the week on which it actually occured?  Why jump it allover the calendar the way Easter does?  Why not just go with the Sundayfollowing Passover the way the Bible has it?  Why seek after unbiblicalmethods?  > I don't recall a command in Scripture for us to celebrate > the resurrection, but it is the sole and only reason that > we are Christians--how could we not celebrate it?       So what does this question have to do with Easter (the whoregoddess)?  I am all for celebrating the Resurrection.  Just keep thatwhore out of the discussion.  > If it is only the name which is a problem, I suggest that if > we are too concerned about etymology, there are a lot of > words we are going to have to drop.  (As an aside, some > terminally PC people here in Ottawa want dictionaries to be > altered so that there are no negative definitions associated > with the word _black_, so as not to offend people of colour.

Fine by me.  And while we are at it, the left-handed people areboth ""sinister"" and ""gauche"" so we probably will have some objections fromthat quarter as well.  > In Quebec French, the word for the celebration of the > resurrection is ""Pa^ques""--this is etymologically related > to Pesach (Passover) and the pascal lamb.  So is the > French Canadian (mostly Roman Catholic) celebration better > because it uses the right name?       Yes, that sounds much better to me.

What happened to ""there is > neither Jew nor Greek, slave nor free, male nor female, for > all are one in Christ Jesus""?       Read the letter to Philemon.  Now tell me, was Philemon's ""slave""returned to him?  Were there different rules upon the slave than uponPhilemon?  How about male and female?  Are there different ""rules"" thatapply to them as well?  Or if there is no more ""male and female"" can Adamand Steve get married to each other in your congregation?  Yes, there aredifferences in form and function.  But the way we come to Salvation inMessiah remains the same no matter what our position in life. ---------------------------------------[I am in general not in favor of continuing this discussion, as itseems repetitive, but this particular point is one that I believe isnew -- the objection is not to having a holiday but to its name.I'd like to suggest that people think very carefully about thisargument.  Words often change their meaning over time.  The days ofthe week are of course originally based on pagan gods.  SomeChristians prefer to refer to ""first day"", ""second day"", etc.  Howeverthe majority of Christians have not been persuaded.  The questionseems to be whether it makes any difference what the dictionary showsas the derivation of a word, if what people mean by it and think whenthey use it is different.Indeed I'd like to suggest that postings like this could themselves bedangerous.  Suppose people in general use Easter to mean thecelebration of Christ's resurrection.  Postings trying to convincethem that they really mean a celebration in honor of some godess runthe risk of creating exactly the situation that they claim to oppose.They are doing their best to *create* a linkage in people's mindsbetween their celebration and the pagan goddess.  It's not clear thatthis is a healthy thing.--clh]"	soc.religion.christian

In thiswork, Swinburne attempts to construct a series of inductive arguments for theexistence of God.  His arguments, which are somewhat tendentious and relyupon the imputation of late 20th century western Christian values andaesthetics to a God which is supposedly as simple as can be conceived, weredecisively rejected in Mackie's ""The Miracle of Theism"".

MACKIE""The Miracle of Theism"", OxfordThis (posthumous) volume contains a comprehensive review of the principalarguments for and against the existence of God.  It ranges from the classicalphilosophical positions of Descartes, Anselm, Berkeley, Hume et al, throughthe moral arguments of Newman, Kant and Sidgwick, to the recent restatementsof the classical theses by Plantinga and Swinburne.  It also addresses thosepositions which push the concept of God beyond the realm of the rational,such as those of Kierkegaard, Kung and Philips, as well as ""replacements forGod"" such as Lelie's axiarchism.

Temperature controlis difficult in space, and your inflatable hangar will have to incorporate thermal insulation (maybe a double-walled inflatable).Micrometeoroid protection and radiation protection are also required.Don't think this will be a clear plastic bubble; it's more likelyto look like a big white ball made out of the same kind of multi-layerfabric that soft-torso space suits are made out of today.Because almost all manned space vessels (Skylab, Mir, Salyut) usedtheir pressurization for increased structural rigidity, even thoughthey had (have) metal skins, they still kind of qualify as inflatable.The inflation process would have to be carefully controlled.  Thespace environment reduces ductility in exposed materials (due totemperature extremes, monotomic Oxygen impingement, and radiationeffects on materials), so your ""fabric"" may not retain any flexibilityfor long.  (This may not matter.)  Even after inflation, pressurechanges in the hangar may cause flexing in the fabric, which couldlead to holes and tears as ductility decreases.These are some of the technical difficulties which the LLNL proposalfor an inflatable space station dealt with to varying degrees ofsuccess.-- Ken Jenks, NASA/JSC/GM2, Space Shuttle Program Office      kjenks@gothamcity.jsc.nasa.gov  (713) 483-4368     ""Good ideas are common -- what's uncommon are people who'll      work hard enough to bring them about."" -- Ashleigh Brilliant"	sci.space

"Newsgroup:talk.politics.gunsdocument_id: 54306From: dswartz@osf.org (Dan Swartzendruber)Subject: Re: Ax the ATFA few comments on the ATF's botched handling of this case:1. Attempting to storm the compound in broad daylight?  The explanation   we were given (at least at one point) was that they thought the cult   members would be at religious services.  My only comment on this bit   of idiocy is that if you're going to operate as a quasi-military unit,   you'd better understand basic military tactics.  One cardinal rule   is that only a fool plans an operation where if one assumption is   incorrect, the operation will fail disastrously.2. We were told that ATF got four agents killed because they were   outgunned, they didn't expect such heavy resistance.  When   questioned about why such an overwhelming military-style assault   was planned, we were told that it was because the cultists were   thought to be heavily armed.  Can you say contradictory?  I knew   you could!3. The BATF has had a bad reputation for years as a bunch of arrogant,   hotdoggers.  I was talking to relatives a couple of weeks ago and   referred to them as a bunch of Crockett and Tubbs wannabes.  I'm   more than ever convinced that's right on target.  An anecdote not   related to the Waco fiasco is that apparently the BATF screwed up   some of the evidence in the World Trade Center bombing.  There's   now an excellent chance some of the forensic evidence gathered by   the FBI will not be admissible in court.  This is not hearsay.  I   was told this by a relative of my wife's who happens to be an FBI   agent.  His opinion of the BATF was, ummm, well, let's just say   uncomplimentary.4. I have *still* not been presented with one iota of evidence that   the BD's had *any* of the alleged illegal weaponry which was the   reason for the raid in the first place.  BTW, we're *still* hearing   this justification.  AG Reno, on CNN yesterday, made references   to this issue, without any substantiation.  She also waved around   the ""He's a child abuser and we heard he was beating the children!""   flag.  Sigh.5. A point re the Feds in general: their handling of the whole siege   reflected a complete lack of understanding of the probable thought   processes of the cultists.  AG Reno said they pushed the button   because they were afraid a mass suicide was in the offing.  My   only comment on that is that if the cultists were that close to   the edge, what the hell did she think their reaction would be to   an hours-long assault on the compound where holes were punched in   the walls and CS gas pumped in?  If I were a BD, I'd expect the   forces of the godless government to assault me at any time.  In   that light, whether they torched themselves or drank Jim Jones   Kool-Aid is irrelevant.  Also, look at how the siege was conducted:   Bright lights, loud rock music, cutting off communications and   other contact with the outside.  All measures designed to make the   BD's feel more and more isolated and threatened.  This might have   been a great strategy - if they were dealing with criminals.  As it   was, it looks to me like everything they did fed into Koresh's   paranoid delusions.-- #include <std_disclaimer.h>Dan S."	talk.politics.guns

"Newsgroup:talk.politics.mideastdocument_id: 76490From: Center for Policy Research <cpr@igc.apc.org>Subject: Unconventional peace proposalFrom: Center for Policy Research <cpr>Subject: Unconventional peace proposalA unconventional proposal for peace in the Middle-East.---------------------------------------------------------- by			  Elias DavidssonThe following proposal is based on the following assumptions:1.      Fundamental human rights, such as the right to life, toeducation, to establish a family and have children, to humandignity, the right to free movement, to free expression, etc. aremore important to human existence that the rights of states.2.      In the event of a conflict between basic human rights andrights of collectivities, basic human rights should prevail.3.      Between the collectivities defining themselves asJewish-Israeli and Palestinian-Arab, however labelled, anunresolved conflict exists.4.      This conflict has caused great sufferings for millions ofpeople. It moreover poisons relations between communities, peoplesand nations.5.      Each year, the United States expends billions of dollarsin economic and military aid to the conflicting parties.6.      Attempts to solve the Israeli-Arab conflict by traditionalpolitical means have failed.7.      As long as the conflict is perceived as that between twodistinct ethnical/religious communities/peoples which claim theland, there is no just nor peaceful solution possible.8.      Love between human beings can be capitalized for the sakeof peace and justice. When people love, they share.Having stated my assumptions, I will now state my proposal.1.      A Fund should be established which would disburse grantsfor each child born to a couple where one partner is Israeli-Jewand the other Palestinian-Arab.2.      To be entitled for a grant, a couple will have to provethat one of the partners possesses or is entitled to Israelicitizenship under the Law of Return and the other partner,although born in areas under current Isreali control, is notentitled to such citizenship under the Law of Return.3.      For the first child, the grant will amount to $18.000. Forthe second the third child, $12.000 for each child. For eachsubsequent child, the grant will amount to $6.000 for each child.4.      The Fund would be financed by a variety of sources whichhave shown interest in promoting a peaceful solution to theIsraeli-Arab conflict, including the U.S. Government, Jewish andChristian organizations in the U.S.  and a great number ofgovernments and international organizations.5.      The emergence of a considerable number of 'mixed'marriages in Israel/Palestine, all of whom would have relatives on'both sides' of the divide, would make the conflict lose itsethnical and unsoluble core and strengthen the emergence of atruly civil society. The existence of a strong 'mixed' stock ofpeople would also help the integration of Israeli society into theMiddle-East in a graceful manner.Objections to this proposal will certainly be voiced. I willattempt to identify some of these:1.      The idea of providing financial incentives to selectedforms of partnership and marriage, is not conventional. However,it is based on the concept of affirmative action, which isrecognized as a legitimate form of public policy to reverse theperverse effects of segregation and discrimination. Internationallaw clearly permits affirmative action when it is aimed atreducing racial discrimination and segregation.2.      It may be objected that the Israeli-Palestinian conflictis not primarily a religious or ethnical conflict, but that it isa conflict between a colonialist settler society and an indigenouscolonized society that can only regain its freedom by armedstruggle. This objection is based on the assumption that the'enemy' is not Zionism as ideology and practice, butIsraeli-Jewish society and its members which will have to bedefeated. This objection has no merit because it does not fulfillthe first two assumptions concerning the primacy of fundamentalhuman rights over collective rights (see above)3.      Fundamentalist Jews would certainly object to the use offinancial incentives to encourage 'mixed marriages'. From theirpoint of view, the continued existence of a specific Jewish Peopleoverrides any other consideration, be it human love, peace ofhuman rights.  The President of the World Jewish Congress, EdgarBronfman, reflected this view a few years ago in an interview hegave to Der Spiegel, a German magazine. He called the increasingassimilation of Jews in the world a <calamity>, comparable in itseffects only with the Holocaust. This objection has no meriteither because it does not fulfill the first two assumptions (seeabove)4.      It may objected that only a few people inIsrael/Palestine, would request such grants and that it would thusnot serve its purpose. To this objection one might respond thatalthough it is not possible to determine with certainty the effectof such a proposal, the existence of such a Fund would help mixedcouples to resist the pressure of their respective societies andencourage young couples to reject fundamentalist and racistattitudes.5.      It may objected that such a Fund would need great sums tobring about substantial demographic changes. This objection hasmerits. However, it must be remembered that huge sums, more than$3 billion, are expended each year by the United States governmentand by U.S. organizations to maintain an elusive peace in theMiddle-East through armaments. A mere fraction of these sums wouldsuffice to launch the above proposal and create a more favorableclimate towards the existence of 'mixed' marriages inIsrael/Palestine, thus encouraging the emergence of anon-segregated society in that worn-torn land.I would be thankful for critical comments to the above proposal aswell for any dissemination of this proposal for meaningfuldiscussion and enrichment.Elias Davidsson Post Box 1760 121 Reykjavik, ICELAND"	talk.politics.mideast

Some say this, some say>that.  >>     How can the bulk of the people be informed, when they won't read>     informative publications?Because much of the public aren't even aware of the NAMES of informativepublications.  Look at the 'wealth' of material on the typical newsstand.Unless the person is working in some kind of technical environment, withthe usual trade journals, all they ever see is the media (note: mediain this context is the popular media - TV, radio, daily newspapers, andsuch publications as Time, Newsweek, and all that).  And they all saypretty much the same thing.  I see most of them being in the range ofcenter-left to far Left, and generally supportive of pie-in-skywe-will-take- care-of-you-think-for-you-cradle-to-grave.  There seemsto be an air of arrogance that the individual is not capable ofunderstanding major issues so the media doesn't bother to inform them(as with Clipper, for example) or tells the people how to interpretevents in others.  What is lost sight of is that the people are not goodat understanding things because they are not TOLD accurate informationabout them.  It is a lot to expect of the people for them to beclarirvoyant.  For example, I would have been unaware of Clipper hadI not picked it up on USENET.  How much of the population has USENET,let alone Internet access?For access to better publications, the person has to spend time digging.Many folks, especially who work long hours, have families, etc., do nothave TIME to go digging, and many are not (yet) aware things are wrong,so are not motivated to dig.  Not saying its right, just saying that isthe way things are.  People aren't upset about things when they aren'tTOLD.  And the less than objective media is a major contributer to theproblem.And then compound that with an attitude of arrogance in the civil service(bureaucrats, politicians) that act as if the person without politicalconnections, or deep pockets (potential contributer) should have few ifany rights, being a resource to be used by those in control for theirpolticial or financial gain.  Some Law Enforcement agencies act as ifthey regard the common person with a rather intense degree of contempt,peons that are supposed to do what they are TOLD, and get very nastywhen someone questions them.  The media pundits/editors, etc tend tofall into those with privilege, and tend to not be upset by the currentstate of affairs.  The fellow in DC, who shot the swimmer in his Jacuzzifor daring to swim in it, with an ILLEGALLY owned gun (violating the lawhe pushed to be foisted on everyone else), ends up walking where a lesswell-connected person would have been crucified.  A typical example ofone standard for 'us', a much more restrictive standard for 'other folk'.Perhaps I am not real eloquent in expressing this, but the solutionsure as hell is NOT to make it HARDER for people to find out what isgoing on, or dismiss their concerns because one happens to be in a positionwhere one feels they are exempt or insulated.  Such as that hypocrite ofa journalist in DC described above.  One notices that these less-thancomplimentary points about that double-standard was NOT covered in themedia.  I feel the reason was it dovetailed with their political viewson the subject, and it involved a 'brother' journalist.Isn't it time for our 'objective' media, the MAIN SOURCE of info for theaverage person, to start being what they claim to be, instead of spindoctors for the Statist elements?>-- >Rahul Dhesi <dhesi@rahul.net>>also:  dhesi@cirrus.com-- pat@rwing.uucp      [Without prejudice UCC 1-207]     (Pat Myrto) Seattle, WA         If all else fails, try:       ...!uunet!pilchuck!rwing!patWISDOM: ""Only two things are infinite; the universe and human stupidity,         and I am not sure about the former.""              - Albert Einstien"	sci.crypt

How does this applyto homosexuals?  I understand ""fornication"" to be sex outside ofmarriage.  Is this an accurate definition?  Is there any such thing assame-sex marriage in the Bible?  My understanding has always been thatthe New Testament blesses sexual intercourse only between a husbandand his wife.  I am, however, willing to listen to Scriptural evidenceto the contrary.""You shall not lie with a male as one lies with a female; it is anabomination.  Also you shall not have intercourse with any animal tobe defiled with it, nor shall any woman stand before an animal to matewith it; it is a perversion.""  Lev. 18:22-23.I notice that the verse forbidding bestiality immediately follows theverse prohibiting what appears to be homosexual intercourse.  I knowof no New Testament passages that clearly condemn, or even mention,intercourse with animals.  Do those who argue for the legitimacy ofhomosexual intercourse believe that the Bible condemns bestiality as aperversion, and if so, why?  That is, what verses would you cite toprove that bestiality was perverted and sinful?  Could the verses youcite be refuted by interpreting them differently?  Can one be aChristian zoophile?By the way, I myself am subject to sexual desires that I did notchoose to have and that many people would regard as perverted andsinful, so please understand that I am not asking these questions outof an antipathy towards my fellow ""people of alternativeorientations"".  I do believe, however, that one should read the Biblewith an attitude of ""what is the Bible trying to say"" and not ""what doI WANT the Bible to say.""  I choose not to give in to my ""perverted""sexual desires because I believe the Bible tries to tell me, whether Ilike it or not, that such things are sin.  It is frustrating at times,and I have had days where it really got me down, but I don't blame Godfor this, I blame the sin itself.- Mark[There's some ambiguity about the meaning of the words in the passageyou quote.  Both liberal and conservative sources seem to agree that""homosexual"" is not the general term for homosexuals, but is likely tohave a meaning like homosexual prostitute.  That doesn't meant that Ithink all the Biblical evidence vanishes, but the nature of theevidence is such that you can't just quote one verse and solve things.I think your argument from fornication is circular.  Why ishomosexuality wrong?  Because it's fornication.  Why is itfornication?  Because they're not married.  Why aren't they married?Because the church refuses to do a marriage ceremony.  Why does thechurch refuse to do a marriage ceremony?  Because homosexuality iswrong.  In order to break the circle there's got to be some otherreason to think homosexuality is wrong.--clh]"	soc.religion.christian

This isunlike the case for socialism where a socialist consensus that heldfor a while and then fell apart would not leave us where we are now,but instead with lots of bureaucracy that would be hard to get rid of,if not tyranny as the end condition of a strong socialist consensus.-- Ervan Darnell                                        ervan@cs.rice.edu	talk.politics.misc

The alternative approach (to CISC), which has been adopted by many in recent years, has come to be known as ""RISC"": the Reduced Instruction Set Computer.  This can be characterised simply as ""Simpler is Faster""; by simplifying the design (e.g.  by reducing the variety of instructions & addressing modes), the hardware can be designed to run faster.  Even at the cost of needing more instructions, the same task can be done more quickly by the simpler, faster design. A typical RISC processor will:    o provide a large number of registers (e.g.  32);    o perform all data operations on registers;    o provide few addressing modes (e.g. immediate or 'register + offset');    o only allow load & store operations to access memory;    o only use a few instruction formats;    o only support a few data types (e.g. integer, unsigned, floating).Steffi Beckhaus                 JANET: Steffi.Beckhaus@uk.ac.newcastleIf the odds are a million to one against something occurring, chancesare 50-50 it will."	comp.os.ms-windows.misc

A recent rough testshowed a gently sloping loss to 10-20db down at 1000cps. Then it falls offa cliff to 70-80dbs down from 1500cps on.  This type of loss is difficultto fit. I am currently using some old siemens behind the ear aids whichkeep me roughly functional, but leave a lot to be desired.Recently I had an opportunity to test the Widex Q8 behind the ear aids forseveral weeks. These have four independent programs which are intended tobe customized for different hearing situations and can be reprogramed. Ifound them to be a definite improvement over my current aids and was aboutto go ahead with them until another local outfit advertised a free trial ofanother programmable system called ReSound.Unfortunately I was only able to try the ReSound aids in their office forabout 30 minutes and I couldn't compare them 'head to head' with the Widex.Nevertheless, it did appear to me that they were superior and I wasimpressed by what I was able to read about the theory behind them which Iwill give in a separate posting. They also carry the Widex aids and had onepatient (presumably wealthy) who decided to go ahead and get the ReSoundeven though he had purchased the Widex only 6 months ago.The problem is that the ReSound aids are about twice as expensive as theWidex and other programmable aids. I could take a trip to Europe on thedifference!  Being a lover of bargains and hating to spend money, I amhaving a hard time persuading myself to go with the ReSounds. I wouldappreciate any opinions on this and other hearing aids and projectionsabout when and if I might see improvements in technology that aren't quiteso expensive.-Rich Haller <rhaller@ns.uoregon.edu>   University of Oregon, Eugene, OR,USA	sci.med

In thiswork, Swinburne attempts to construct a series of inductive arguments for theexistence of God.  His arguments, which are somewhat tendentious and relyupon the imputation of late 20th century western Christian values andaesthetics to a God which is supposedly as simple as can be conceived, weredecisively rejected in Mackie's ""The Miracle of Theism"".

It ranges from the classicalphilosophical positions of Descartes, Anselm, Berkeley, Hume et al, throughthe moral arguments of Newman, Kant and Sidgwick, to the recent restatementsof the classical theses by Plantinga and Swinburne.  It also addresses thosepositions which push the concept of God beyond the realm of the rational,such as those of Kierkegaard, Kung and Philips, as well as ""replacements forGod"" such as Lelie's axiarchism.

When I got to the library last week, itwas with the object in view to look at some articles that have appearedover the last few years, since my previous look at the literature.  Un-fortunately, they had moved the journal back-issues, so I didn't get alook at the articles I was hoping to find.  I will continue to reservemy own judgment on _arsenokoitai_ until I have seen the latest scholarlywork, and I can hope that REXLEX's posting may give some meat to chew on.However, what I *can* do now, is to point out the methodological issues-- what needs to be shown for anything to be concluded in this matter.If the article REXLEX posts addresses these issues, so much the better;if not, you will perhaps understand why the problem is hard.>                 James B. DeYoungwrites, _in abstractu_:>this study argues that Paul coined the term arsenokoitai, deriving it>from the LXX of Lev 20:12 (cf. 18:22) and using it for homosexual>orientation and behavior	[it is only a minor point, but let me make it anyway; De Young has	already contradicted his own prior assertion in this abstract that	the ancient analysis of these issues was concerned with actions and	NOT with orientation.  I doubt this will have much bearing on the	article as such, but thought I should point it out from the start.]The hypothesis De Young is advancing is that Paul a) coined the word andb) his intended meaning for it was in reference to the Levitical law.  Thequestions I wish to raise are	1.)  how would one go about confirming the truth of this hypothesis?and	2.)  what follows if one accepts (or stipulates, for the sake of the	     discussion) that it is correct?Note that b) is independent of a); I consider b) far more plausible than a),which seems merely to be a counsel of despair over finding nothing in theliterature contemporary with Paul to clarify this word.  So far as I know,Paul does NOT in general invent words anywhere else in his letters.  Unlessyou have an otherwise-established pattern of coinages, it is *not* soundmethodology to assume it -- particularly if he gives no hint in the immedi-ate text to ""fix"" the coinage's meaning for his audience.As yet, the extract presents no evidence at all.  What do we need to confirmor reject the hypothesis? (which, I should say at the outset, I find somewhatplausible; I certainly know of nothing which makes it an *impossible* wayof construing this problem passage.)  I'm going to set aside for the momentthe question of whether Paul might have coined this usage, to look at themore tractable question of what it means.  For this there are, in principle,two kinds of evidence that can be adduced, internal and external.  That is,we can look at the text of Paul's letter for clarification or look outsidethat to prior or contemporary writings that Paul might have relied on, or toderivative writings that have some claim of access to Paul's meaning.The single WORST problem with this word in Corinthians is that there IS nointernal evidence for Paul's meaning.  He uses the word totally without anexplanation or hint as to his meaning, save that its inclusion in a list ofnegatives implies that it has for him SOME negative meaning.We are left, as the only ""internal"" clue, with the etymology or formationof the word -- which is indeed the reason that De Young (and others beforehim) have associated it with the Leviticus prohibition of men VERBing withother men, where VERB is some standard euphemism for having sex (""lie"" inLeviticus, ""bed"" in Greek).  One problem is that ""bedders"" (_-koitai_) isnot, as far as I know, USED that way in Greek.  THEREFORE, I offer oneserious test which de Young's hypothesis *must* pass or be rejected:	o  find a body of Greek texts contemporary with Paul (or not much	   prior to his day) such that the _X-koitai_ formation implies	   ""men who have sex with X""  [obviously, the ""best case"" is to	   find such usages of _arsenokoitai_ itself.]such texts would be confirmation that the word *can* be read that way.It is worth emphasizing that compound words are NOT in general under-standable by projecting what the READER may imagine by the juxtapositionof the roots.  Existence of such parallels doesn't *prove* the hypothesiscorrect -- but it goes a long way towards making such a usage (whether ornot original with Paul in the specific case of X == _arse:n_) possibleof comprehension by his readers.My ""test"" moves in the direction of external evidence.  If Paul does NOTin his text explain his word (and he does not), then he has to expect hisreaders to already know the word (which stands against its being a coinage)or to expect that it mimics word formations that they *do* know, such thatthey can guess his meaning without too much floundering.External evidence, that is, texts other than Paul's own and lexicographicor social/historical considerations that might be adduced, then come intothe picture.  *If* there are other uses of the word, not dependent on Paul,which *have* sufficient internal (contextual) evidence -- or some gloss bya contemporary scribe -- to show a derogatory reference to male homosexu-ality, or similar _-koitai_ formations used in similar ways, *then* onehas grounds for	o  denying that Paul coined the wordand	o  assuming that his readers might understand his meaningDo you see the problem?  If Paul coined the word, then he REQUIRES hisreaders to share enough context with him to COMPREHEND his coinage andits intent -- in this case that they would (stipulating De Young's guess)understand him to be referring to the Levitical ""universal"" prohibitionof male-male sex (this, mind you, in a context where Paul has emphasizedat least to OTHER congregations (and so one assumes to the Corinthians --how else to explain 1 Cor. 6:12, and the Corinthians having to be pulledback from overinterpreting their freedom?) the NON applicability of Torahlaw to his gentile converts!)Among the considerations that make it implausible for Paul to have coinedthe word, its first element is archaic -- _arse:n_ is an old Attic orIonic form of what in even classical (let alone koine) times would beassimilated as _arre:n_.  To me, this implies that we are even more thanusually needful of external evidence to pin down meaning and usage.  Whatis Paul doing inventing a word in obsolete Attic formation?And if he *didn't* coin the word, but picked it up like the others inhis list as common terms of derogation, then his meaning will be -- forhis readers -- constrained by that common meaning (since he gives noother.)I cannot emphasize enough that Paul DOES NOT TELL US what he means bythis word.  We (and his original readers) are guessing.  They, at least,had a contemporary context -- and maybe Paul had used this very word andexplained it in great detail to them in person.  But we have no trace ofevidence of that, and to *suppose* it is mere fantasy.So -- we are *desperately* in need of external evidence about this word.And it seems to be exceptionally meagre.  That is precisely the problem.I can think of several more or less equally plausible hypotheses aboutthe word:	a)  it was a standard gutter term of abuse for (some or all, maybe	    very specific, maybe very general) homosexual male activities	b)  it was a term of abuse used by Jews about the awful homosexual	    Greeks (which may or may not be consciously associated on their	    part with the Leviticus passage)	c)  Paul invented the term -- and again there may or may not be an	    association with Leviticus in his doing so.  He may or may not	    intend the word to have an explicit and universal application	    with absolute and clear boundaries.  [Since none of his OTHER	    words in that list have such character, this last seems to me	    about the *least* plausible of the hypotheses I'm advancing.]Of these, I'd say off the top of my head that a) is most plausible -- butI still have reservations about that, too.If the word NEVER appears before Paul, and in later uses has some evidenceof depending on Paul, then one can opt for Paul's coining it.  If it doesappear before him, he might *still* have coined it being unaware of prioruse (in which case, his coinage is inherently confusing!) but one shouldnormally demote c) on the basis of any earlier uses (especially if theycan be shown to have been at all common in the places Paul traveled.)  Ineither of the a) or b) cases, one has to take into account Paul's relationto the community of usage he picked the word up from -- and whether it befrom the Greek or Jewish communities, Paul's relations are hardly straight-forward!There is, so far as I have yet seen, little or no external evidence to aidus in selecting one of these (or some other) hypothesis.  Your guess is asgood as mine (or maybe worse or maybe better, depending on a lot of things).But it remains -- so far -- guesswork.  And I don't know about you, but Ifor one WILL NOT equate human guesswork with the will of God.  By all meansbe convinced in your own conscience about what Paul is getting at -- as hesays elsewhere on what was in HIS day a major controversy of somewhat thissame character (Romans 14:22-23)	""Hold on to your own belief, as between yourself and God -- and	consider the man fortunate who can make his decision without going	against his conscience.  But anybody who eats in a state of doubt	is condemned, because he is not in good faith, and every act done	in bad faith is a sin.""For my part, I cannot see any way to resolve Paul's meaning in the use of_arsenokoitai_ without directly applicable external evidence -- and bythe nature of such external evidence, it will never reach to certaintyof constraining Paul's own intent.  Paul, like Humpty Dumpty (and me, andall the rest of us) *will* use words in ways that are personal choices --and sometimes leave his readers puzzled.  If that puzzlement leads youto God, it may be blessed -- if it should lead away (as some of Paul'swords HAVE led some people), then Paul's intense communicative effort tocontrive his meaning in our souls may have some regretable consequences.I have always found Paul to be a fantastically reliable guide -- if Iread him ""in the large"", if I can see him lay out his position in detailand hammer it home time and time again.  I am much less certain about hismeaning in his many brief and cryptic passages (such as this one.)In my usual discursive way, I have gone on at great length about the firstof my intended meta-exegetical points -- what would be needed to confirmthat Paul a) coined or b) in any case meant the word to mean the same asthe Leviticus prohibition.  My second point is to *stipulate* this hypo-thesis, and follow up what it implies for both his initial readers andfor later Christians.

I have had>a quick look in the computer graphics literature with no results.>Perhaps someone who has access to medical information could help? Certainly. Reference follows. Bear in mind that there are at least two conditions which may be calledred/green colour blind. One, protanopia, is caused by a lack or majordysfunction of the L cones, those that respond best to longwavelengths. This gives much reduced red/green and red/violet discrimination andalso means that reds look dimmer than than they do to people with normal vision.The other, deuteranopia, is due to missing or dysfunctional M cones although itcan also be caused by a lack of the L-M cone difference signals in the retina.It also gives reduced red/green discrimination but red/violet is unaffected. Unlike protanopia, reds are not dimmer than  normal.On a uniform chromaticity diagram - the horseshoe shaped one you see in computergraphics books - there is a single confusion point for each type of colourdeficiency. Colours which are confused lie on straight lines radiating from thispoint. For protanopia the point is at u'=0.61,v'=0.51, very close to the far redcorner. For deuteranopia, the point is at u'=-4.75, v'=1.31Note that different experimental investigations in the literature give slightlydifferent values for these depending on the precise details of the experimentalsetup, random errors, and so on. The values quoted are typical.So if all colours on a line are seen as the same, which colour is actually seen?This problem has now been solved. Tests on people with one normal eye and oneaffected eye have shown that there is an axis for each type of disorder ontowhich all the colours collapse. For protanopes this joins up 473nm and 574nm onthe spectral locus (the edge of the horseshoe); for deuteranopes the line isvery similar,  joining 477nm and 579nm.*So* to convert colours from normal vision to a simulated protanopia orduuteranopia:1) Plot the colour on a uniform chromaticity diagram2) Construct a line from this point to the appropriate confusion point3) Find the intersection of this line with the appropriate axis line4) This is the new chromaticity. The best reference for this is Meyer, G.W. & Greenberg, D.P. (1988) 'Colourdefective vision and computer graphics displays', IEEE Computer Graphics andApplications 8(5) 28-40.You will also need a decent reference on basic colour science if you are notfamiliar with the CIE XYZ colour model and the uniform chromaticity scale diagram.>I would like to write a program (probably a PPM filter) to allow>previewing of images to check for sufficient contract for colour>blind users. Not being colour blind myself, this is a bit difficult!Yes this is certainly possible. You will need the chromaticities of the redgreen and blue phosphors of the monitor you intend to display the images on, andthe chromaticity of the white point. This information can be measured, orobtained from the manufacturer. I posted a list of some monitor chromaticities acouple of weeks ago.The procedure, for each pixel (!) is as follows. (Some lookup tables might be ahelp here.)A) convert RGB to CIE XYZ. This is a simple 3*3 matrix multiplication once youhave the monitor data.B) retaining the Y component for later, convert XYZ to chromaticity coordinates u'v'using u' = 4X/(X+15Y+3Z), v' = 9Y/(X+15Y+3Z)C) find the equation of the line as in step 2 aboveD) find the intersection as in step 3E) convert back from u'v' to XYZ, using the Y value from step AF) Ensure that this new colour can be displayed on your monitor; if not, move italong a line in XYZ space towards neutral grey (ie half way between black andwhite) until it is displayable.>Please email replies - I will summarise and repost if there is>sufficient interestDone; also posted for the rest of us.--Chris Lilley----------------------------------------------------------------------------Technical Author, ITTI Computer Graphics and Visualisation Training ProjectComputer Graphics Unit, Manchester Computing Centre, Oxford Road, Manchester, UK.

It's 1024x768, up to 72hz atthat res, and it got a good write-up for image quality in a recent (Feb.?)issue of PC Magazine.  As far as I know, very little fully matches a NEC inimage quality (at least according to the mags -- I can't tell anydifference between the two!), but I think NEC is low emissions on only oneof the two types.  There's VLF (Very Low Frequency) and ELF (I think that'sExtremely Low Frequency).  The MPR-II standards set strict limits on both.But many comapnies, NEC included according to one article I read (I get abunch of mags so it's hard for me to remember which!), which claim ""lowemissions"" but not specifically ""MPR-II Compliant"" or ""MPR-II Certified""only control for one, usually VLF, and ignore the other.	So, the NEC probably has higher overall image quality (I consis-tently hear it rated as the best or close to the best), but not as lowemissions as the Hitachi.  I like my image quality, but for all I know youmay be more discerning.

Simply serach for the codes 00 01 02 03 to locate the biginning of the ""normal"" keyboard map.  Then swap the codes for the keys that you wish to swap.  See the keyboard directory of simtel for programs that report the scancode for each key to you (some bios programs also have this info).Good luck,- Pete____________________________________________________________________________| Peter J.

Your 2F2 capwill have been designed as a RAM battery substitute, rather than for use inapplications where you wish to drain the cap with a constant current. Theirperformance, in some respects, is more akin to batteries than to a normal cap.The other point is that big electro's are usually rated with -5%+20% tolerances,so calculating exactly what capacitance you have (particularly when consideringthe cold).You should be looking at designing a micropower oscillator and divider chain,that ""rolls over"" (from zero to maximum count, or vice-versa) once every1,209,600 seconds. If you were to use something like a 110Hz clock, you wouldneed a divider chain of 2^27, to give an error of less than one percent in thefiring times over the six week period. Of course, you could trim the 110Hzoscillator to give you exact time, but the likelyhood of the oscillatorremaining exactly constant at -40 is low anyway.I would suspect that there would be far more battrey drain in firing thesolenoid than there would be in the timer circuit.Caveat - I'm not experienced in low temperature electronics, so I can'tguarantee that this (or any other) approach is the best for inhospitableconditions.JohnH----------------------------------------------------------------------------      |  _  |_   _   |_|  _   _|  _|              Electronics Department    |_| (_) | | | |  | | (_| (_| (_| \/           School of MPCE    ---------------------------------/-           Macquarie University                                                  Sydney, AUSTRALIA 2109    Email: johnh@mpce.mq.edu.au, Ph: +61 2 805 8959, Fax: +61 2 805 8983----------------------------------------------------------------------------"	sci.electronics

I know there's a specificterm for this form of logic, but it escapes me right now. However, if itwere sound, then you should be able to apply it this way; If the Bibledoesn't specifically say that something is wrong, then it must be OK,which, coincidentally, leads perfectly into a question I've often pondered.If slavery is immoral (which I believe it is, can I assume that everyoneelse in this group does too?), why doesn't Jesus or any of the apostlesspeak out against it? Owning slaves was common practice back then. Paulspeaks about everything else that is immoral. He apparently thought itwas important enough to talk about things like not being a drunkard. Whydoesn't anyone mention slavery? If God's morals are eternal and don'tchange like the morals of society, then it must have been just as immoral thenas it is today."	soc.religion.christian

"Newsgroup:talk.politics.mideastdocument_id: 75408From: dbd@urartu.sdpa.org (David Davidian)Subject: Treatment of Armenians in Azerbaijan #1DEPOSITION of VITALY NIKOLAYEVICH DANIELIAN [1]          Born 1972          Attended 9th Grade          Middle School No. 17          Resident at Building 4/2, Apartment 25          Microdistrict No. 3          Sumgait [Azerbaijan]Really, people in town didn't know what was happening on February 27. I came home from school at 12 o'clock, being excused to leave before the last period in order to go to Baku. When we left, everything in town was fine. Life was the same as usual, a few groups of people were discussing things, soccer and other things. Then we got on the Sumgait bus bound for Baku for my first cousin's birthday, my father, my mother, and I. We spent the day in Baku, and on the 28th, somewhere around 6:00 p.m., we got on the bus for home, figuring that I'd have enough time to do my homework for the next day.When we were entering town, near the 12-story high-rises, our bus was stopped by a very large crowd. The crowd demanded that the Armenians get off the bus. The driver says that there are no Armenians on board; then everyone on the busbegins to shout that there are no Armenians on board. The group comes up to the doors of the bus and has people get out one by one, not checking passports, just going by the way people look. We get off the bus, but are not taken for Armenians.We set out in the direction of home. At first we were going to go into an old building where we knew there'd be a place to hide, but the whole road was packed with groups of people, all the way from Block 41 to the 8th Microdistrict. These groups were emptying people's pockets and checkingpassports. People who didn't have passports with them were beaten as well.Then we decided to go home instead. Near the 12-story high-rises I saw burningcars and a great many people standing around the driveways, yelling. ""Death tothe Armenians"" was written on the cars.When we came into the courtyard--we live in an L-shaped building--it was stillquiet. We went on upstairs, but didn't turn on any lights. We tried to call Baku to warn our relatives, who were due to arrive on Wednesday, not to come. Then there was a knock at the door. It was our neighbors, who advised us to come down to stay at their place. We went down to their place, and they led usto the basement. They live on the first floor and have a basement which you enter across the balcony. We sat in the basement while an Armenian woman was beaten--she ran away naked. Our neighbors' daughter said that that's right, that's what the Armenians deserve, because in Stepanakert, allegedly, people were being killed, 11 girls from Agdam had been raped. We didn't stay very long in the basement. We tried to support one another as best we could, looking out the small window with the iron grating. Papa watched and said things now and then. He said that there was a fire near Building 5, probably acar on fire. Then one of the groups approached our driveway and demanded that they be shown the apartments where Armenians lived. The neighbors said that there weren't any Armenians here, and the group set out for the other wing of the building. They appeared from the 5/2 side of the building, where, I later found out, a woman had been murdered. The woman who ran away naked died. YuriAvakian was killed, too.When the crowd left, the neighbors said that it was all over and we could go home. We went back up to our place and again didn't turn on the light. We started to gather up our things in order to leave Sumgait for a while. Wetried to call a relative who lived in Sumgait, but there was no answer. Wedecided she had already left.We sat at home. The phone rang, and the caller asked to speak with myfather. I called him to the phone. It was Jeykhun Mamedov, from my father'swork brigade. He said he was disgusted by what was happening in ourtown. He asked for our address and promised to get a car and help us getout of the city. To be quite honest, Papa didn't want to give him our address,but my mother got on the phone and told him. Some 15 minutes after thecall a crowd ran into our entryway. Bursting into the building, they brokedown the door and came into the apartment . . .They came straight to our apartment, they knew exactly where the Armenians were. They came into our place. We tried to resist, but there was nothing we could do. One of them took my parents' passports and began to read them. He read the surname ""Danielian,"" turned the page, read ""Armenian,"" and that alonewas enough to doom us. He said that we should be moved quickly out into the courtyard, where they would have done with us. Another, standing next to him, pushed some of the keys on the piano and said ""your death has tolled."" They had knives and steel truncheons.I had a knife in my hand. Unfortunately, I didn't use it. I just knew that ifI didn't give up the knife things would be much worse. They struck my parents and said that I should put the knife on the piano. Then, one of them commandedthat we be taken outside. One person was giving orders. When we were taken outdoors I went in the middle, and my mother was behind me. Someone started topush her so she'd walk faster; I let her go ahead of me, and fell in behind her. When he tried to push me, I hit him, and at that moment they began beating my parents; I realized that resistance was completely useless.We are taken out into the courtyard, and the neighbors are standing on their balconies to see what will happen next. The crowd surrounds us. At first they strike me, and I'm knocked out; when I come to, they beat me again . . . I lose consciousness often . . . I don't see or hear my parents, since I was thefirst one hit and was out cold. When I come to I try to pick them up; they arelying next to me. The crowd is gone, the only people around are watching from their balconies. That's it. I try to pick them up, but can't. My left arm is broken. I start toward the drive, wanting to tell the neighbors to call an ambulance. The bodies of my parents are still warm.We were attacked at around 9 o'clock. I regain consciousness at about 11 and try to make it up the stairs home . . . When I knock at the neighbors' door, they push me back and tell me to go away. I go up to the third floor, our neighbor puts a damp cloth on my head and says she will call an ambulance; shesends her son off for one and takes me to our apartment. I often look out the window to see if the ambulance has arrived, but I can't see very far as a result of the blows, and it seems that my parents have already been taken away. Then I calm down and try to convince myself that they have been taken away, and everything will be OK.But they were still there. Later, at 8 in the morning as I found out, theambulance picked them up, but they were already dead. If they receivedattention on time, it is possible they would still be alive. Later, around 12 o'clock on the 29th, policemen in civilian clothing come to our house with some ""assistants."" They call an ambulance, and 20 minutes later it arrives, and I am taken to the Sumgait Emergency Hospital. There they stitch the woundson my head and rebind my arm. At 3 o'clock I and the other Armenians who are in the hospital are sent by ambulance to Baku.In my ward at the Sumgait Hospital there were five people, all of themArmenians. The hospital was nearly overflowing with Armenians. The onlyAzerbaijanis there were those whose car had flipped over before the events,before the 27th.Then I was in the Semashko Hospital in Baku. I was there 38 days. When I was released, on the 40th day, I found out that my parents were dead. At first they told me that they were in Moscow being treated, but later I found out that they were dead. My father's older brother told me.My father's name was Nikolai Artemovich Danielian. He was born in 1938. My mother, born in 1937, was Seda Osipovna Danielian. Papa worked at PMK-20, the leader of the roofing brigade; mamma was a compressor operator.They were also beaten on the head. The coroner's report stated that theirheads were smashed open and bled profusely.At the confrontation I met Jeykhun Mamedov, who had called. As it turned out later, he had been the one who tipped the crowd off. He had called specifically to find out if we were at home and to find out the exact address and dispatch the group. He knew the phone number, but didn't know the address.Before the events I had never seen him, but had often spoken with him on the phone, when he would ask to speak with my father. I knew him by name. He denies that I was the one who answered the phone, saying that my father answered it. He denies that he called from a public phone, saying that he called from home, which also isn't true. I heard noise and the sounds of automobiles. As I later found out, earlier he had been convicted, but had never served any time--he had received a suspended sentence. He was about 20 years old. I don't know if he has since confessed or not. I am sure that he was the one who tipped the crowd off. One-hundred percent sure.My parents were from Karabagh. Father was from the village of Badar, and was two years old when his family moved to Baku, where his elder brothers were togo to school. He was a student at the Naval School, but never graduated. Hewent off to work on the virgin lands [one of the gigantic agricultural projects instituted under Khrushchev.] When he returned he lived in Baku, and later moved to Sumgait, helping with the town's construction. Mamma was from the village of Dagdagan, also from Karabagh. She worked in Sumgait, first in a bookstore, and later, on a construction site.My sister is older than I. She lives with her husband here in Karabagh. Ialways loved my parents. That was why I went on to 9th grade, because itwas their dream that I would continue my studies. I finished 8th grade andwanted to enter the Baku Nautical School, and after that, the MilitarySchool. But later I changed my mind, or rather, my parents got me to recon-sider, saying that it would be better to finish the 10th grade and then join the Naval School. I was planning to be in the Navy almost my whole lifelong--since childhood I had dreamed of being a sailor. My father wanted itmore than anything. He always recollected his youth, telling of the School,and he always said that he had made a big mistake in leaving it.Now I live in Karabagh and never plan to leave here. I will stay at the home of my grandfather, of my ancestors, till the end of my days.While in the hospital in Baku I learned the fates of many others who hadsuffered as well, like Ishkhan [Trdatov]. He managed to hold them off [attheir residence in Microdistrict 3, Building 6/2, Apartment 6.] for a longtime, lost his father [Gabriel], and by some miracle managed to survive. Ialso learned of Uncle Sasha, from Building 5/2, whose daughter was raped. . . Besides them, Valery--I forgot his last name--was in the hospital too,about a year younger than I, he went to School No. 14. He was riding withhis parents in the car. People were throwing rocks at them, he was hit, andhis parents brought him to the hospital, and he was in our ward. We evencame to be friends. Before that we had just seen each other around town. Butin the hospital we got to know one another better. I learned of the fates ofothers, those who had died, or who were befallen by misfortune . . .Today Suren Harutunian, the First Secretary of the Communist party of Armenia,was shown on television. To be honest I am glad that Armenia agreed to recognize Nagorno Karabagh as part of the Armenian Soviet Socialist Republic.I was repelled, no, revolted, to hear the Baku announcer who read the decisionof the Azerbaijani Supreme Soviet Presidium against Karabagh becoming part of Armenia.After the events in Sumgait and those in Baku, the best solution is to giveKarabagh to Armenia, return it to Armenia, since the people want to livepeacefully with the Azerbaijanis, but everything has to be right before theycan do that.I arrived in Karabagh on April 11. I felt very bad. I had constant headaches.After a while my strength returned. My older sister, Suzanna, took me in. I think that justice should prevail; the people are demanding their due.You can't take away what is their due. My parents and I often spoke of NagornoKarabagh, often visited here--spent almost all of my vacations here. We had even decided that if Karabagh would be made part of Armenia, we would move here for sure. We always said that the Armenian people had suffered much, and that what had been done in 1921--removing Nagorno Karabagh from Armenia--waswrong. Sooner or later, mistakes should be corrected. And in order to correct a mistake, it must not be repeated; and the fate of all Nagorno Karabagh lies in the hands of our government.June 13,1988Stepanakert -- David Davidian dbd@urartu.sdpa.org   | ""How do we explain Turkish troops onS.D.P.A.

There is a sphere of in radius.This last case can be achieved with 3 colinier points and any 4th pointby taking the 4th point and pairs of the first 3 parallel lines will be producedit can also be achieved byIf all 4 points are coplanar but are not on one circle. It seems to me that the algorithm only fails when the 4 points are coplanar.The algorithm always fails when the points are coplanar.(4 points being colinear => coplanar)Testing if the 4th point is coplanar when the plane of the first 3 pointshas been found is trivial.>An alternate method would be to take pairs of points: the plane formed>by the perpendicular bisector of each line segment pair also contains the>center of the sphere.

Similar prizes have influenced aerospace development before. The $25k Orteig prize helped Lindbergh sell his Spirit of Saint Louis venture to his financial backers.If memory serves, the $25k prize would not have been enough to totally reimburse some of the more expensive transatlantic projects (such as Fokker's, Nungesser and other multi-engine projects).

Good point -- it is very true that these ""false"" predictions aredangerous--we are warned (more than once) in scripture about false prophtets.	However, as is often the case with other issues, one cannot let thosewho falsly report such ""visions"" as a reason against believing in any of them(I did not get the impression you were asserting this, by the way...I considermy response not so much a response to your posting but a response to the topicas a whole).	Example:  The Appearances of Mary at Fatima, Portugal in 1917.	Among other things, she predicted the conversion of Russia to Atheism	(something that happened less than a year later w/ the Bolshevik	revolution).  She also predicted the second world war (that is, predicte	predicted that it would occur during the papacy of a certain pope, who	was not the current one.  It happened just like she said.)	She warned there would be ""fire in the sky"" as a warning that the 	second world war was about to start.  About a week before Germany	invaded, weathermen (and women, I suppose) all over Europe, from	England to Spain to Eastern Europe, reported the most spectacular	reddish color in the sky ever recorded.  To this day some try to 	explain it off as the northern lights, and the relation to Mary's	prediction simply coincidence.  You all can decide for yourselves.	Mary predicted that the Atheistic Russia would spread her evils all	over the world and persecute religion.  	She said many other things as well, too numerous to list here.  Every	single one has been realized.  	One can only use the term ""coincidence""	so many times in the same explanation before its use becomes 	ridiculous.  	SO...yes, there are many false prophets and many false reports. There	are true ones, too.  We must always remain open to that.  Fatima was	one example.  There is another one, currently occuring--the 	apparitions that have been taking place at Medjurgorje, Yugoslavia	(or whatever its called now).  Mary has been appearing every day for	eleven years now.  It's time the world started listening.	More info available to any who want it.

I am working on a project for my marketing class and I'd like toask your help.  The assignment is to come up with a product and create amarketing plan for it.  Technical issues are not terribly important atthis point.  Well, my group's plan is to market a ""full page"" monitorfor laptop computers.  It would be a third-party product to be installedby authorized repair centers (like Newer Technology's PaletteBookscreen).  The idea is that the screen would fold in such a way that youwould get twice the screen height of a normal screen (remember,technical issues aside!).  In fact, by adjusting the fold of the screenand the monitor configuration, you could have regular OR ""full"" height. The screen would probably be monochrome.The motivation behind this is that laptop computers seem to be verypopular among business people.  Business people also commonly use wordprocessing and spreadsheet applications for which it is very convenientto see a large portion of the document.  Because of the target users andapplications, color screens aren't really a neccessity.  We couldhopefully keep the cost between $2000 and $3000.Now, please don't write this off as completely ridiculous.  I reallyneed some constructive feedback.

The heat sourceis a 100 watt light bulb.  Basically, it's a vertical wooden box withventilation holes in the top and bottom (lots of them, you want the airto flow).  The light bulb goes in the bottom, and wire cake racks arespaced every 6"" starting about 10"" above the bulb.Or, at a slightly higher cost in electricity, you can do what I do:  Useyour oven.  (NOTE - I do this in an electric oven; some gas ovens maynot have a low enough setting).  Put food to be dried on cookie tins orracks in the oven.  Set oven to 140 degrees (the lowest setting on myoven - if yours goes down to 120 that's probably even better.)  Stick awooden spoon or something across the front corner of the oven and closethe door on the spoon so that it stays open about an inch - this allowsfor airflow.  Leave the stuff in the oven for 6 to 8 hours; check itoften, since this dries it much faster than the dehydrator.  If you areusing cookie sheets instead of racks, turn the stuff over halfwaythrough.If you want more info, e-mail me since this isn't really the right subfor this stuff.gerald.belton@ozonehole.com * SLMR 2.1 * I still miss my boss, but my aim is improving.                       ----The Ozone Hole BBS * A Private Bulletin Board Service * (504)891-31423 Full Service Nodes * USRobotics 16.8K bps * 10 Gigs * 100,000 FilesSKYDIVE New Orleans! * RIME Network Mail HUB * 500+ Usenet NewsgroupsPlease route all questions or inquiries to:  postmaster@ozonehole.com"	sci.electronics

Why?      Wrong point. The age of the universe has no direct effect onhumanity's sticking power, in the way the moral system of a society canhave.      I'm saying the Universe has a ""real age"", because I see evidencefor it; cosmology, astronomy and so on. I say this age is independent ofpeople's opinions of it, because I know different people have a lot ofdifferent opinions in the matter, yet empirical tests consistently seemto give roughly the same results.>#      The age of the universe, like most scientific facts, can be>#emirically verified through means that'll give the same result no matter>#who performs the testing (albeit there are error bars that may be on the>#largish side...). > > This assumes that the universe has a real age, or any kind of reality> which doesn't depend on what we think.

Because logically consistent empirical tests contradict theiropinion.

"Newsgroup:sci.spacedocument_id: 60241From: dbm0000@tm0006.lerc.nasa.gov (David B. Mckissock)Subject: NASA ""Wraps""In the April edition of ""One Small Step for a Space Activist"",Allen Sherzer & Tim Kyger write:  ""Another problem is what are called 'wraps' (or sometimes   the 'center tax'). When work for a large program like   Freedom or Shuttle is performed at a NASA center, the   center skims off a portion which goes into what amounts   to a slush fund. This money is used to fund work the   center manager wants to fund. This sum is estimated to   be over a third of the funds allocated. Think about   that: Of the $30 billion cost of Freedom, fully $10   billion won't be spent on anything having anything   to do with Space Stations! Now, maybe that $10 billion   was wisely spent (and maybe it wasn't), but the work done   with it should stand on its own merits, not distorting   the cost of other projects. Congress has no idea of the   existense of these wraps; Congress has never heard the   term 'center tax'. They look at the Station they are   getting and the price they are paying and note that   it doesn't add up. They wonder this blissfully unaware   that a third of the money is going for something else.""My dear friends, your mixing fact and fiction here. A coupleof weeks ago, when I first read this in your posting, Italked with one of the cost experts here in Space Stationat Headquarters [if you wondering why I didn't post aresponse immediately, I do have a real job I'm supposedto be doing here at Headquarters, & digging up old 20 kHzdata & looking into Sherzer/Kyger claims rates pretty lowon the totem pole of priority. Also, I spent last weekendin Kansas City, at the National Science Teachers Association conference, extolling the virtues of SSFto 15,000 science teachers.]First off, yes, the concept of 'center tax', or 'wrap' doesexist. If I recall the numbers correctly, the total 'tax'for the SSF program for this fiscal year is around $40 Million.This was computed by adding up the WP-1, WP-2, and WP-4center 'taxes'. With the SSF budget for this fiscal year at$2.2 Billion, my calculater says the tax percentage is04/2.2 = 1.8%Over the life of the SSF program, using your figure of $30billion for the cost of SSF, a tax at a 1.8% rate comes to$540 million. This is alot less than $10 billion, but Iwill concede it's still an appreciable amount of pocketchange.I should note that your estimate of the tax rate at 1/3 couldbe close to the actual rate. The tax is only charged on fundsthat are spent at the center (kind of like McDonalds at somestates, where you do have to pay sales tax if you eatthe food at the restaurant, but you don't if you get ittake-out). For example, at WP-4, the vast bulk of the fundswe receive go to the Rocketdyne Contract, and are *NOT*subject to the center tax (I don't have the numbers infront of me, but I'd guess at least 95% of the WP-4 fundsgo to Rocketdyne). So, you could be right about a taxrate of 1/3, but it's only applied to funds spent at thecenter, and not to the prime contracts.This leads to the obvious question ""What is the governmentdoing with SSF funds that don't go to the prime contractors?(i.e. ok, WP-4 gets a slice of the $30 billion pie. Abig portion of this slice goes to Rocketdyne. What happensto the balance of the funds, which aren't eatenup by the center tax?)""At WP-4, we call these funds we spend in-house supportingdevelopment funds (as they are supporting the developmentwork done by Rocketdyne). We have used these funds tosetup our own testbed, to checkout the electricalpower system architecture. Our testbed has a real lifesolar array field (left over from solar cell researchresearch a few years back), with lead-acid car batteries(to simulate the Nickel-Hydrogen batteries on SSF), DCswitchgear, DC-DC converter units, and simulatedloads. Data from the testbed was used in a recentchange evaluation involving concerns about the stabilityof the power system.We have also used the supporting development money topurchase Nickel Hydrogen batteries, which are on lifetesting at both Lewis and the Crane Naval facility inIndiana. As a side point, 6 of the battery cells ontest recently hit the four year life test milestone.38 cells have completed 18,552 to 23,405 cycles (theon-orbit batteries go through 5,840 cycles per year).As a final example, my 'home' division at Lewis usedthe supporting development funds to purchase personalcomputers and work stations, for performing systemanalyses (like modeling of the performance of theelectrical power system, availability calculationsusing a Monte-Carlo simulation, setting up a database with information on weight of the powersystem elements).Finally, the money raised by the 'tax' does not allgo into a 'slush fund.' At Lewis, the directordoes control a small discretionary fund. Each year,any individual at Lewis can submit a proposal tothe director to get money from this fund to lookat pretty much anything within the Lewis Charter.Most of the tax, however, goes to fund the 'general'services at the Center, like the library, the central computer services division, the Contractor who removes the snow, etc. Thus, it is ratherdifficult to determine what percentage of theSSF budget doesn't go for SSF activities. To getan accurate figure, you would have to takethe annual expenditure for the library (for example),and then divide by the amount of the library fundsused to support SSF (which would be hard tocompute by itself - how would you figure outwhat percentage of the bill for Aviation Week for1 year is 'billable' to SSF, would you base it onthe person-hours SSF employees spend reading AV-weekversus the rest of the center personnel). You wouldthen have to compare this estimate of the SSFportion of the library expense with the portion ofthe tax that goes to support the library. Who knows,maybe SSF overpays on the tax to run the library, butwe underpay for snow removal? Talk abouta burecratic nightmare!My last point is that I can't believe your claim thatCongress has never heard of the term 'center tax.'Unfortunately, all of the NASA testimony beforeCongress isn't on a computer, so I can't do a simpleword search someplace to prove you wrong. But surely,in some GAO audit somewhere, these NASA cost methodswere documented for Congress?"	sci.space

The author is not responsible for any         damage caused by this program.Important changes since Version 1.35:  Added support for IRIS.  Support Mix/Concat. two images.  Added support for 'batch conversion'.  Added support for 'load/save palette table'.  Added support for 'edge enhance'.  Added support for 'crop one line'.  Added support for 'negate image'.  New color quantization option.  Fix some minor bugs.(1) Introduction:  This program can let you READ, WRITE and DISPLAY images with different  formats. It also let you do some special effects(ROTATION, DITHERING ....)  on image. Its main purpose is to let you convert image among different  formts.  Include simple file management system.  Support 'slide show'.+ Support 'batch conversion'.  There is NO LIMIT on image size.  Currently this program supports 8, 15, 16, 24 bits display.  If you want to use HiColor or TrueColor, you must have VESA driver.  If you want to modify video driver, please read section (8).(2) Hardware Requirement:  PC 386 or better. MSDOS 3.3 or higher.  min amount of ram is 4M bytes(Maybe less memory will also work).  (I recommend min 8M bytes for better performance).  Hard disk for swapping(virtual memory).  The following description is borrowed from DJGPP.  Supported Wares:  * Up to 128M of extended memory (expanded under VCPI)  * Up to 128M of disk space used for swapping  * SuperVGA 256-color mode up to 1024x768  * 80387  * XMS & VDISK memory allocation strategies  * VCPI programs, such as QEMM, DESQview, and 386MAX  Unsupported:  * DPMI  * Microsoft Windows  Features: 80387 emulator, 32-bit unix-ish environment, flat memory  model, SVGA graphics.(3) Installation:  Video drivers, emu387 and go32.exe are borrowed from DJGPP.  (If you use Western Digital VGA chips, read readme.wd)  (This GO32.EXE is a modified version for vesa and is COMPLETELY compatible   with original version)  *** But some people report that this go32.exe is not compatible with      other DJGPP programs in their system. If you encounter this problem,      DON'T put go32.exe within search path.  *** Please read runme.bat for how to run this program.  If you choose xxxxx.grn as video driver, add 'nc 256' to environment    GO32.  For example, go32=driver x:/xxxxx/xxxxx.grn nc 256  If you don't have 80x87, add 'emu x:/xxxxx/emu387' to environment GO32.  For example, go32=driver x:/xxxxx/xxxxx.grd emu x:/xxxxx/emu387  **** Notes: 1. I only test tr8900.grn, et4000.grn and vesa.grn.                 Other drivers are not tested.              2. I have modified et4000.grn to support 8, 15, 16, 24 bits                 display. You don't need to use vesa driver.                 If et4000.grn doesn't work, please try vesa.grn.              3. For those who want to use HiColor or TrueColor display,                 please use vesa.grn(except et4000 users).

All Read/Write support full color(8 bits), grey scale, b/w dither,      and 24 bits image, if allowed for that format.(7) Detail:   Initialization:      Set default display type to highest display type.      Find allowable screen resolution(for .grn video driver only).   1. When you run this program, you will enter 'read' menu. Whthin this      menu you can press any function key. If you move or copy      files, you will enter 'write' menu. the 'write' menu is much like      'read' menu, but only allow you to change directory.      The header line in 'read' menu includes ""(d:xx,f:xx,t:xx)"".        d : display type. f: number of files. t: number of tagged files.      pressing SPACE in 'read' menu will let you select which format to use        for reading current file.      pressing RETURN in 'read' menu will let you reading current file. This        program will automatically determine which format this file is.        The procedure is: First, check magic number. If fail, check        standard extension. Still fail, report error.      pressing s or S in 'read' menu will do 'Slide Show'.        If delay time is 0, program will wait until you hit a key          (except ESCAPE).        If any error occurs, program will make a beep.+       'w' or 'W' to pause, any key to continue.        ESCAPE to terminate.      pressing Ins in 'read' menu will change display type.      pressing ALT-X in 'read' menu will quit program without prompting.+     pressing F5 will turn on 'effect' menu.   2. Once image file is successfully read, you will enter 'screen' menu.      You can do special effect on image.      pressing RETURN: show image.        in graphic mode, press RETURN, SPACE or ESCAPE to return to text        mode.      pressing TAB: change processing target. This program allows you to do        special effects on 8-bit or 24-bit image.      pressing Left,Right arrow: change display type. 8, 15, 16, 24 bits.      pressing SPACE: save current image to file.        B/W Dither: save as black/white image(1 bit).        Grey Scale: save as grey image(8 bits).        Full Color: save as color image(8 bits).        True Color: save as 24-bit image.        This program will ask you some questions if you want to write image        to file. Some questions are format-dependent. Finally This program        will prompt you a filename. If you want to save file under another        directory other than current directory, please press SPACE. after        pressing SPACE, you will enter 'write2' menu. You can change        directory to what you want. Then,        pressing SPACE: this program will prompt you 'original' filename.        pressing RETURN: this program will prompt you 'selected' filename                      (filename under bar).  3. This program supports 8, 15, 16, 24 bits display.  4. This Program is MEMORY GREEDY. If you don't have enough memory,     the performance is poor.  5. If you want to save 8 bits image :       try GIF then TIFF(LZW) then TARGA then Sun Raster then BMP then ...     If you want to save 24 bits image (lossless):       try TIFF(LZW) or TARGA or ILBM or Sun Raster       (No one is better for true 24bits image)  6.

I wrote that human brains ""areinfested with sin"", and can be trusted only in limited circumstances.In reply, Mr Boundary wrote:> I would beg to differ with you here.  The properly-formed conscience> can be trusted virtually ALL the time.Which just moves the problem back one level: how do you tell if yourconscience is properly formed?The only way to tell is to presuppose that you are capable of judging theformed-ness of your own conscience.  In other words, you can only be surethat your conscience is `properly formed' if you assume that your evaluationcan be trusted.  Assuming your conclusions saves you a lot of time, I'llgrant, but it's not a valid way of reasoning.Unless you are infallible, your judgements about your own thinking cannot becertain.  Therefore, it is not possible to be certain your conscience is`properly formed'.  (Whatever that is supposed to mean.)Mr Boundary then gives another paradigm example of the problem:> Now you have hit on the purpose of the Church.  It is by necessity the> infallible interpreter of divine revelation.  Without the Church,          > Christianity would be nothing more than a bunch of little divisive sects.The Church is `by necessity' the infallible interpreter of divine revelation?How do you know?  Presumably, you believe this because of some argument oranother -- how do you know that the argument contains no mistakes?You write:> Therefore, although our minds are finite and susceptible to error, our> competence in arriving at inductive insights gives confidence in our> ability to distinguish what is true from what is not true, even in areas> not subject to the experimental method. But there is a huge difference between `confidence in our ability todistinguish what is true from what is not true' and `infallible'.  I amconfident about a lot of things, but absolute certainty is a very long wayfrom `confident'.This discussion is about the arrogance of claiming to be absolutely certain(really, go check the subject line).  Saying you are absolutely certain issignificantly different than saying you are confident.  When you say thatyou are confident, that invites people to ask why.Except in very limited circumstances, when you say that you are absolutelycertain, it invites people to dismiss you as someone who does not have anyidea of his own fallibility.I have yet to meet anyone who believed in a knowably-infallible source oftruth who would admit the possibility of errors in his reasoning.  All ofthem -- every last one -- has claimed that he was himself infallible.The result has been to convince me that they had no idea what was going on.Darren F Provine / kilroy@gboro.rowan.edu[This particular discussion may not be entirely relevant to theoriginal criticism.  I get the feeling that the original posterregarded as arrogant the very idea that there are right and wronganswers in religion, and that the difference can have eternalconsequences.  When I say that I think there is a hell and that he isat least in significant danger of ending up there, I will admit that-- as you say -- the reasoning processes I used to reach this arefallible.  Thus at least in principle I could be wrong.  But thesebasic facts are clearly enough taught in the Bible that I think it'sunlikely that I'm misinterpreting it.  (In order to get this level ofconfidence, I've tried to frame my statement sufficiently carefully asto sidestep a number of the more controversial issues.  I haven't, forexample said that all non-Christians will definitely end up in hell,and I haven't attempted to describe hell in any detail.)  I have afeeling that my view is going to be regarded as arrogant andintolerant even though I acknowledge that I'm fallible and so there'ssome chance I'm wrong.Don't get me wrong -- I think there are a lot of genuinely arrogantChristians, and often criticism of us is justified.  But in at leastsome cases I think the criticisms constitute blaming the messenger.If the universe is set up so that there are eternal consequences forcertain decisions, it's not my fault -- I'm just telling it the way Ithink it is.  You may think God is immoral for setting things up thatway.  It's one of the critiques of Christianity that I find it mostdifficult to respond to.

True,Cone is probably as good as Drysdale, and they have no Koufax, but still,these teams were winning with home run leaders who had very bad totals, withlots of low-scoring games, etc.  And they didn't use relievers, whereasJeff Montgomery is having a super season for them.

There's more of achance of that, I think, than of a team with tremendous hitting but nopitching.  At least, to me.     I wonder, though - which one do you people think would do better - a teamwith Johnson, Koufax in his prime, Seaver, Carlton, and Young, in no realorder, as the starters, with Sutter, Fingers, and Lyle in the bullpen, butwith a puny offense (assuming good defense, like Mazeroski, Maranville, etc.)Or a team with poor pitching, but with an offense of Cobb, Carew, Ruth, Gehrig,Mays, Schmidt, Wagner, and Bench - again,you pick the order.     I would postulate that the pitching one would be several games better byseasons' end.  Even the best hitters can succeed only 2/5 of the time intheir best years, but a great pitcher can throw lots of shutouts - taking allthe players in their prime, they might throw 50 shutouts in a year.  And allthe offense would have to do is get 1 run across.

There are safer ways to preserve food, wines, and beers!I think 1) outlaw the use of these substances without warning labels aslarge as those on cig. packages.2) Require 30% of comparable products on the market to be free of thesesubstances and state that they are free of MSG, DYES, NITROSIAMINES and SULFITES on the package.3) While at it outlaw yellow dye #5.  For that matter why dye food?  4) Take the dyes and flavorings out of vitamins.  (In my OSCO only StressTabs (tm) didn't have yellow dye #5)  { My doctor says Yellow Dye #5 isresponsible for 1/2 of all nasal polyps !!! }KEEP FOOD FOOD!

That's all.The RAM was mapped into the top 128 bytes of page 0, and shadowed in page1. The 6502 has a zero-page addressing mode on most instructions that isboth shorter and faster than the normal ones, so it is important on amachine like this to have the scratchpad RAM in page 0. Unfortunately, italso wants its stack to be in page 1 (the stack pointer is 8 bits, and thehigh byte of the address is hardwired to 1).The IOT section was mapped into page 2 somewhere. 2 8 bit I/O registers(can't remember if each bit could be independantly set to I or O like the6522 and 6526), and 1(?) 8(?) bit timer with a programmable prescaler (Ithink this was some power of 2). There were no interrupts in the system, somany games would set up the timer at some known time, go away and dosomething else for a while, then sit and wait for the timer to run down.There was no logic in the box to do address decoding - the RIOT had atleast 2 chip select pins (probably one active high, one active low), and Iimagine the TIA was much the same. Various address lines were fed directlyto chip selects. The 6507 likes to have ROM right at the top of memory, sothe 2600 had to use ROMs with active high chip selects - not exactlynormal, so some cartriges had a 7404 in them to convert this to the moreusual active low chip select.John West	sci.electronics

Yes indeed Turkeyhas the military prowess to intervene, what she wishes she had, however, is the diplomatic power to stop the hostilities and bring the parties to thenegotiating table.  That's hard to do when Armenians are attacking Azeri towns.  Armenian leaders are lacking the statesmanship to recognize the futility of armed conflict and convince their nation that a compromise that leads to stability is much better than a military faits accomplis that's going to cause incessant skirmishes.  Think of 10 or 20 years down the line -- both of the newly independent countries need to develop economicallyand neither one is going to wipe the other out.  These people will beneighbors, would it not be better to keep the bad blood between them minimal?If you belong to the Armenian diaspora, keep in mind that what strikesyour fancy on the map is costing the local Armenians dearly in terms of theirblood and future.  It's easy to be comfortable abroad and propagandize craziness to have your feelings about Turks tickled.

"Newsgroup:talk.politics.mideastDocument_id: 75408From: dbd@urartu.sdpa.org (David Davidian)Subject: Treatment of Armenians in Azerbaijan #1DEPOSITION of VITALY NIKOLAYEVICH DANIELIAN [1]          Born 1972          Attended 9th Grade          Middle School No. 17          Resident at Building 4/2, Apartment 25          Microdistrict No. 3          Sumgait [Azerbaijan]Really, people in town didn't know what was happening on February 27. I came home from school at 12 o'clock, being excused to leave before the last period in order to go to Baku. When we left, everything in town was fine. Life was the same as usual, a few groups of people were discussing things, soccer and other things. Then we got on the Sumgait bus bound for Baku for my first cousin's birthday, my father, my mother, and I. We spent the day in Baku, and on the 28th, somewhere around 6:00 p.m., we got on the bus for home, figuring that I'd have enough time to do my homework for the next day.When we were entering town, near the 12-story high-rises, our bus was stopped by a very large crowd. The crowd demanded that the Armenians get off the bus. The driver says that there are no Armenians on board; then everyone on the busbegins to shout that there are no Armenians on board. The group comes up to the doors of the bus and has people get out one by one, not checking passports, just going by the way people look. We get off the bus, but are not taken for Armenians.We set out in the direction of home. At first we were going to go into an old building where we knew there'd be a place to hide, but the whole road was packed with groups of people, all the way from Block 41 to the 8th Microdistrict. These groups were emptying people's pockets and checkingpassports. People who didn't have passports with them were beaten as well.Then we decided to go home instead. Near the 12-story high-rises I saw burningcars and a great many people standing around the driveways, yelling. ""Death tothe Armenians"" was written on the cars.When we came into the courtyard--we live in an L-shaped building--it was stillquiet. We went on upstairs, but didn't turn on any lights. We tried to call Baku to warn our relatives, who were due to arrive on Wednesday, not to come. Then there was a knock at the door. It was our neighbors, who advised us to come down to stay at their place. We went down to their place, and they led usto the basement. They live on the first floor and have a basement which you enter across the balcony. We sat in the basement while an Armenian woman was beaten--she ran away naked. Our neighbors' daughter said that that's right, that's what the Armenians deserve, because in Stepanakert, allegedly, people were being killed, 11 girls from Agdam had been raped. We didn't stay very long in the basement. We tried to support one another as best we could, looking out the small window with the iron grating. Papa watched and said things now and then. He said that there was a fire near Building 5, probably acar on fire. Then one of the groups approached our driveway and demanded that they be shown the apartments where Armenians lived. The neighbors said that there weren't any Armenians here, and the group set out for the other wing of the building. They appeared from the 5/2 side of the building, where, I later found out, a woman had been murdered. The woman who ran away naked died. YuriAvakian was killed, too.When the crowd left, the neighbors said that it was all over and we could go home. We went back up to our place and again didn't turn on the light. We started to gather up our things in order to leave Sumgait for a while. Wetried to call a relative who lived in Sumgait, but there was no answer. Wedecided she had already left.We sat at home. The phone rang, and the caller asked to speak with myfather. I called him to the phone. It was Jeykhun Mamedov, from my father'swork brigade. He said he was disgusted by what was happening in ourtown. He asked for our address and promised to get a car and help us getout of the city. To be quite honest, Papa didn't want to give him our address,but my mother got on the phone and told him. Some 15 minutes after thecall a crowd ran into our entryway. Bursting into the building, they brokedown the door and came into the apartment . . .They came straight to our apartment, they knew exactly where the Armenians were. They came into our place. We tried to resist, but there was nothing we could do. One of them took my parents' passports and began to read them. He read the surname ""Danielian,"" turned the page, read ""Armenian,"" and that alonewas enough to doom us. He said that we should be moved quickly out into the courtyard, where they would have done with us. Another, standing next to him, pushed some of the keys on the piano and said ""your death has tolled."" They had knives and steel truncheons.I had a knife in my hand. Unfortunately, I didn't use it. I just knew that ifI didn't give up the knife things would be much worse. They struck my parents and said that I should put the knife on the piano. Then, one of them commandedthat we be taken outside. One person was giving orders. When we were taken outdoors I went in the middle, and my mother was behind me. Someone started topush her so she'd walk faster; I let her go ahead of me, and fell in behind her. When he tried to push me, I hit him, and at that moment they began beating my parents; I realized that resistance was completely useless.We are taken out into the courtyard, and the neighbors are standing on their balconies to see what will happen next. The crowd surrounds us. At first they strike me, and I'm knocked out; when I come to, they beat me again . . . I lose consciousness often . . . I don't see or hear my parents, since I was thefirst one hit and was out cold. When I come to I try to pick them up; they arelying next to me. The crowd is gone, the only people around are watching from their balconies. That's it. I try to pick them up, but can't. My left arm is broken. I start toward the drive, wanting to tell the neighbors to call an ambulance. The bodies of my parents are still warm.We were attacked at around 9 o'clock. I regain consciousness at about 11 and try to make it up the stairs home . . . When I knock at the neighbors' door, they push me back and tell me to go away. I go up to the third floor, our neighbor puts a damp cloth on my head and says she will call an ambulance; shesends her son off for one and takes me to our apartment. I often look out the window to see if the ambulance has arrived, but I can't see very far as a result of the blows, and it seems that my parents have already been taken away. Then I calm down and try to convince myself that they have been taken away, and everything will be OK.But they were still there. Later, at 8 in the morning as I found out, theambulance picked them up, but they were already dead. If they receivedattention on time, it is possible they would still be alive. Later, around 12 o'clock on the 29th, policemen in civilian clothing come to our house with some ""assistants."" They call an ambulance, and 20 minutes later it arrives, and I am taken to the Sumgait Emergency Hospital. There they stitch the woundson my head and rebind my arm. At 3 o'clock I and the other Armenians who are in the hospital are sent by ambulance to Baku.In my ward at the Sumgait Hospital there were five people, all of themArmenians. The hospital was nearly overflowing with Armenians. The onlyAzerbaijanis there were those whose car had flipped over before the events,before the 27th.Then I was in the Semashko Hospital in Baku. I was there 38 days. When I was released, on the 40th day, I found out that my parents were dead. At first they told me that they were in Moscow being treated, but later I found out that they were dead. My father's older brother told me.My father's name was Nikolai Artemovich Danielian. He was born in 1938. My mother, born in 1937, was Seda Osipovna Danielian. Papa worked at PMK-20, the leader of the roofing brigade; mamma was a compressor operator.They were also beaten on the head. The coroner's report stated that theirheads were smashed open and bled profusely.At the confrontation I met Jeykhun Mamedov, who had called. As it turned out later, he had been the one who tipped the crowd off. He had called specifically to find out if we were at home and to find out the exact address and dispatch the group. He knew the phone number, but didn't know the address.Before the events I had never seen him, but had often spoken with him on the phone, when he would ask to speak with my father. I knew him by name. He denies that I was the one who answered the phone, saying that my father answered it. He denies that he called from a public phone, saying that he called from home, which also isn't true. I heard noise and the sounds of automobiles. As I later found out, earlier he had been convicted, but had never served any time--he had received a suspended sentence. He was about 20 years old. I don't know if he has since confessed or not. I am sure that he was the one who tipped the crowd off. One-hundred percent sure.My parents were from Karabagh. Father was from the village of Badar, and was two years old when his family moved to Baku, where his elder brothers were togo to school. He was a student at the Naval School, but never graduated. Hewent off to work on the virgin lands [one of the gigantic agricultural projects instituted under Khrushchev.] When he returned he lived in Baku, and later moved to Sumgait, helping with the town's construction. Mamma was from the village of Dagdagan, also from Karabagh. She worked in Sumgait, first in a bookstore, and later, on a construction site.My sister is older than I. She lives with her husband here in Karabagh. Ialways loved my parents. That was why I went on to 9th grade, because itwas their dream that I would continue my studies. I finished 8th grade andwanted to enter the Baku Nautical School, and after that, the MilitarySchool. But later I changed my mind, or rather, my parents got me to recon-sider, saying that it would be better to finish the 10th grade and then join the Naval School. I was planning to be in the Navy almost my whole lifelong--since childhood I had dreamed of being a sailor. My father wanted itmore than anything. He always recollected his youth, telling of the School,and he always said that he had made a big mistake in leaving it.Now I live in Karabagh and never plan to leave here. I will stay at the home of my grandfather, of my ancestors, till the end of my days.While in the hospital in Baku I learned the fates of many others who hadsuffered as well, like Ishkhan [Trdatov]. He managed to hold them off [attheir residence in Microdistrict 3, Building 6/2, Apartment 6.] for a longtime, lost his father [Gabriel], and by some miracle managed to survive. Ialso learned of Uncle Sasha, from Building 5/2, whose daughter was raped. . . Besides them, Valery--I forgot his last name--was in the hospital too,about a year younger than I, he went to School No. 14. He was riding withhis parents in the car. People were throwing rocks at them, he was hit, andhis parents brought him to the hospital, and he was in our ward. We evencame to be friends. Before that we had just seen each other around town. Butin the hospital we got to know one another better. I learned of the fates ofothers, those who had died, or who were befallen by misfortune . . .Today Suren Harutunian, the First Secretary of the Communist party of Armenia,was shown on television. To be honest I am glad that Armenia agreed to recognize Nagorno Karabagh as part of the Armenian Soviet Socialist Republic.I was repelled, no, revolted, to hear the Baku announcer who read the decisionof the Azerbaijani Supreme Soviet Presidium against Karabagh becoming part of Armenia.After the events in Sumgait and those in Baku, the best solution is to giveKarabagh to Armenia, return it to Armenia, since the people want to livepeacefully with the Azerbaijanis, but everything has to be right before theycan do that.I arrived in Karabagh on April 11. I felt very bad. I had constant headaches.After a while my strength returned. My older sister, Suzanna, took me in. I think that justice should prevail; the people are demanding their due.You can't take away what is their due. My parents and I often spoke of NagornoKarabagh, often visited here--spent almost all of my vacations here. We had even decided that if Karabagh would be made part of Armenia, we would move here for sure. We always said that the Armenian people had suffered much, and that what had been done in 1921--removing Nagorno Karabagh from Armenia--waswrong. Sooner or later, mistakes should be corrected. And in order to correct a mistake, it must not be repeated; and the fate of all Nagorno Karabagh lies in the hands of our government.June 13,1988Stepanakert -- David Davidian dbd@urartu.sdpa.org   | ""How do we explain Turkish troops onS.D.P.A.

Newsgroup:sci.medDocument_id: 59066From: vgwlu@dunsell.calgary.chevron.com (greg w. luft)Subject: Relief of Pain Caused by Cancer I am not sure if this is the proper group to post this to but here goes anyway. About five years ago my mother was diagnosed with having cancer in the lymph nodes under one of her arms. After the doctors removed the cancerous area she had full movement of her arm with only slight aching under her arm when she moved it. Over the course of the next two years the aching got more severe and her complaining to the doctors produced the explanation that it was scar tissue causing the pain. At this time her doctor  suggested that some physiotherapy should be employed to break up the scar tissue. While attending one of her therapy sessions, while her arm was being  manipulated, some damage occured (nerve?) which caused the level of pain to permanently increase severly (controlled by Tylenol 3s) and some loss of use of the arm ( palsied wrist and almost no outward lateral movement). With great persistence on her part the doctors looked further into the issue and discovered that not all of the cancer had been removed and another tumor had grown under the arm. This was removed also but the pain in the arm has not decreased. The doctors are not sure exactly why the pain is  persisting but feel some sort of nerve damage has occured and they have employed Tylenol 3 and soon Morphine to relieve the pain. She has tried acupuncture by this only provides minor reductions in pain and is only short term.   My questions are:      Has anyone has heard of similar cases and what, if anything, was done to reduce the     levels of pain?     Are their methods to block nerves so that the pain can be reduced?     Are their methods to restore nerves so that loss of arm function can be restored?  Any general suggestions on pain reduction would be greatly appreciated.      Please respond by email because I do not always get chance to read this group.  If anyone knows of some literature that may be useful to this case or another newsgroup  that I should be posting this to it would also be appreciated.        -- Gregory W.

I have been able to find nothing beyond that, and>suspect this to be a sort of historical urban legend. Well, you're the one who is in Germany. If you don't believe the history books,look up the primary sources yourself. Those of us outside of Germany do nothave access to these. You do. It seems to me that there were plenty ofdocumented instances - several scandals, the fact that on the ""knight of thelong knives"" several SA members (including Heines) were found sleepingtogether, etc. Also I believe some people were complaining about the SA'shomosexual activities (seducing young boys, etc). The histories that I've read make a very convincing case. None of this sounds like urban legend to me. >(Irving, a>notoriously unreliable historian, says that Funk, the Nazi finance>minister, was homosexual.  He gives no sources.)I know next to nothing about Irving and nothing about Funk. What precisely doyou know, that would contradict all of the other history books that I haveread concerning the existence of homosexual Nazis? Are you trying to say that all historians are taking part in an anti-homosexual smear? What about homosexual writers who agree with the official history? Don't you think they would have found out the truth by now if Roehm and Heines were not homosexuals?I would think they would want to disassociate homosexuality from Nazism. No one should use any connection between the two to bash homosexuals in any case. >I challenge anyone to document this claim.If you are going to challenge *all* historians on this point (not just Irving),then the burden of proof is on you. Track down the references. Find out wherethe stories originate from. Again, you are the one in Germany, close toarchival material - most people on the net are not.>I *have* found a great>deal of evidence that there were many flaming heterosexuals among the>Nazis.  This seems to include all of the worst ones--Hitler, Himmler,>Goebbels, Goering, Heydrich, Eichmann, and many more.Eh? What is your agenda here? To prove that the Nazis were heterosexuals, sothat you can bash heterosexuals? Does it bother you that some of the Nazismight have been homosexuals? Does this make all homosexuals bad if this istrue? Of course not. And what about bisexuals? Are they half-Nazis?I don't know why it would be so difficult to believe that some Nazis werehomosexuals. The German officer corps before WW1, for instance, was notoriousfor its homosexuality. There were numerous scandals which rocked the Germangovt. during the late 19th and early 20th century. Many of the Kaiser's friendswere prosecuted - the Kaiser was no homosexual, but the Germany army had a longtradition of tolerating homosexuality, going far back into Prussian history -back to Frederick the Great at least, who was himself a homosexual. Roehm was a product of this Prussian officer tradition, and the old German army (like theEnglish public school system), being a well known center of homosexuality,would have been quite willing to overlook Roehm's homosexuality.In addition, some Nazis complained of homosexuality in the Hitler Youth. TheHitler Youth swallowed up all pre-Nazi youth groups, and some of the various pre-war Vandervogel, Bund, and Volkish youth groups were known to promote homoerotic ideals and friendship, and in many cases, homosexuality itself. So it seems to me not unlikely that there were plenty of homosexual Nazis, regardless of the official Nazi dogmas concerning the ""evils"" of homosexuality.Why should this suprise anyone? Homosexuality has always existed, in all societies - it would be most unusual if the Nazis were an exception.No, I don't have any sources for you, as I think the only kind of proof youwill accept would be citations from archival material, and I do not have access to these. Nor do I intend to reread every book on the Nazis and on modernhomosexuality that I have ever read - I don't have the time. Nothing isstopping you, however, from chasing down those sources. Until you proveotherwise, though, I will stick with the established histories.                                                                           /\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/David Matthew Deane (deane@binah.cc.brandeis.edu)""...Be in me as the eternal moods of the bleak wind...Let the Gods speak softlyof us in days hereafter...""

Of cause, the R4-version	did not know about the xpTableWidgetClass (we used tableWidgetClass 			instead - caught from the net in times of R3) and XpTableChildPosition 			(formerly XtTblPosition).	Since compiling with R5, the program causes a zero width or height error	(on sparc-stations). The trouble-shooter is the (re)computation of the	model_init_table - table widget: though its childs (label and asciiText 	widgets) exist, XtQueryGeometry returns a prefered width and height of 			zero. 	Thus the following asignment cannot perform anything else but set the 			width and height of the newly created widget to zero. No wonder XtPopup 		or XtManage- Child create zero width or height errors (dependent on 			whether width and height of the shell widget are set in the resource 			file or not).

While most work in hospitals and clinics, many major cities will have RD's who are in ""private practice"" so to speak.  Many physicans will refer their patients with Crohn's disease to RD's for dietary help.  If you can get your friend's physician to make a referral, medical insurance should pay for the RD's services just like the services of a physical therapist.  The better medical insurance plans will cover this but even if your friend's plan doesn't, it would be well worth the cost to get on a good diet to control the intestinal discomfort and help the intestinal lining heal.Crohn's disease is an inflammatory disease of the intestinal lining and lipoxygenase inhibitors may help by decreasing leukotriene formation but I'm not aware of tea or turmeric containing lipoxygenase inhibitors.  For bad inflammation, steroids are used but for a mild case, the side effects are not worth the small benefit gained by steroid use.  Upjohn is developing a new lipoxygenase inhibitor that should greatly help deal with inflammatory diseases but it's not available yet.Marty B."	sci.med

As I recall, its been done to some experimental mice.They showed various ill effects and eventually died.  The reason isthat deuterium does not have exactly the same reaction rates ashydrogen due to its extra mass (which causes lower velocity, Boltzmanconstant, mumble).  This throws various bits of body biochemistry outof kilter, and you get sick and die.I've never heard of anyone being poisened this way, in or out of reallife.  The process takes quite a while.  If anyone wants to write thisbook, I would imagine you would have to:1: Replace a significant fraction of the water in the body with heavy   water.2: Wait while normal breakdown and repair processes cause other   molecules in the body to be synthesised using the deuterium.During this process the victim would gradually deteriorate andeventually die, but I imagine it would take weeks during which thepoisoner would have to ensure that a significant proportion of thewater the victim ingested was heavy.You would get such a mess of symptoms that the doctors would be bothalarmed and confused.  Why should every organ in the body suddenlybegin to deteriorate?  If you can figure out how the poisoner gets theheavy water into the victim in a hospital then you could have a realstory here.Come to think of it, <2> would continue even after the heavy water wasno longer being ingested, so hospitalisation might be too late.The most detectable effect would be that the victim's body fluidswould literally be ""heavy"".  Water has a molecular weight of 18 andheavy water has a MW of 20.  Thus the victim's weight will increase byabout 1% for every 10% of body water replaced by heavy water.  Maybethe detection occurs because some pathologist in the lab notices thatthe victim's urine is strangely dense.  Is there any medical testinvolving the specific gravity of a body fluid?Paul.-- Paul Johnson (paj@gec-mrc.co.uk).	    | Tel: +44 245 73331 ext 3245--------------------------------------------+----------------------------------These ideas and others like them can be had | GEC-Marconi Research is notfor $0.02 each from any reputable idealist. | responsible for my opinions"	sci.med
"Newsgroup:soc.religion.christianDocument_id: 20928From: jhpb@sarto.budd-lake.nj.us (Joseph H. Buehler)Subject: Re: SSPX schism ?Here is some material by Michael Davies on the subject of schism ingeneral and Archishop Lefebvre in particular.  He wrote it around1990.  The first part of the two-part article was on the scandalousactivities of Archbishop Weakland (in this country), but I cut allthat.  And I pared down the rest to what was relevant.Joe Buehler...Schism and DisobedienceAccording to St. Thomas Aquinas, schism consists primarily in arefusal of submission to the Pope or communion with the members of theChurch united to him. On first sight it would appear that, whateverthe subjective motivation of the Archbishop, as discussed above, hemust be in a state of objective schism as he has refused to submit tothe Pope on a very grave matter involving his supreme power ofjurisdiction. However, standard Catholic textbooks of theology make itclear that while all schisms involve disobedience not all acts ofdisobedience are schismatic. If this were so, as was noted at thebeginning of this article, it would mean that the number of Americanbishops who are not schismatic would not reach double figures.The distinction between disobedience and schism is made very clear inthe article on schism in the very authoritative Dictionnaire deTheologie Catholique. The article is by Father Yves Congar who iscertainly no friend of Archbishop Lefebvre.  He explains that schismand disobedience are so similar that they are often confused. FatherCongar writes that schism involves a refusal to accept the existenceof legitimate authority in the Church, for example, Luther's rejectionof the papacy. Father Congar explains that the refusal to accept adecision of legitimate authority in a particular instance does notconstitute schism but disobedience.  The Catholic Encyclopediaexplains that for a Catholic to be truly schismatic he would have tointend ""to sever himself from the Church as far as in him lies.""  Itadds that ""not every disobedience is schism; in order to possess thischaracter it must include besides the transgression of the command ofthe superiors, a denial of their divine right to command.""Not onlydoes Mgr. Lefebvre not deny the divine right of the Pope to command,but he affirms repeatedly his recognition of the Pope's authority andhis intention of never breaking away from Rome. The Archbishop madehis attitude clear in the July/August 1989 issue of 30 Days: ""We prayfor the Pope every day. Nothing has changed with the consecrationslast June 30. We are not sedevacantists. We recognize in John Paul IIthe legitimate Pope of the Catholic Church. We don't even say that heis a heretical Pope. We only say that his Modernist actions favorheresy.""...Intrinsically Schismatic?The principal argument used by those claiming that Mgr. Lefebvre is inschism is that the consecration of a bishop without a papal mandate isan intrinsically schismatic act. A bishop who carries out such aconsecration, it is claimed, becomes ipso facto a schismatic. This isnot true. If such a consecration is an intrinsically schismatic act itwould always have involved the penalty of excommunication. In the 1917Code of Canon Law the offence was punished only by suspension (seeCanon 2370 of the 1917 Code). Pope Pius XII had raised the penalty toexcommunication as a response to the establishment of a schismaticchurch in China. The consecration of these illicit Chinese bishopsdiffered radically from the consecrations carried out by Mgr. Lefebvreas the professed intention was to repudiate the authority of the Pope,that is, to deny that he has the right to govern the Church, and theillicitly consecrated Chinese bishops were given a mandate to exercisean apostolic mission. Neither Archbishop Lefebvre nor any of thebishops he has consecrated claim that they have powers ofjurisdiction. They have been consecrated solely for the purpose ofensuring the survival of the Society by carrying out ordinations andalso to perform confirmations. I do not wish to minimize in any waythe gravity of the step take by Mgr. Lefebvre. The consecration ofbishops without a papal mandate is far more serious matter than theordination of priests as it involves a refusal in practice of theprimacy or jurisdiction belonging by divine right to the RomanPontiff. But the Archbishop could argue that the crisis afflicting theChurch could not be more grave, and that grave measures were needed inresponse.It appears to be taken for granted by most of the Archbishop's criticsthat he was excommunicated for the offense of schism, and the Vaticanhas certainly been guilty of fostering this impression.  There is notso much as a modicum of truth in this allegation. The New Code ofCanon Law includes a section beginning with Canon 1364 entitled""Penalties for Specific Offenses"" (De Poenis in Singula Dicta). Thefirst part deals with ""Offenses against Religion and the Unity of theChurch"" (De Delictis contra Religionem et Ecclesiae Unitatem). Canon1364 deals with the offense of schism which is, evidently, togetherwith apostasy and heresy, one of the three fundamental offensesagainst the unity of the Church.But the Archbishop was not excommunicated under the terms of thiscanon or, indeed, under any canon involving an offense againstreligion or the unity of the church. The canon cited in hisexcommunication comes from the third section of ""Penalties forSpecific Offenses"" which is entitled ""Usurpation of EcclesialFunctions and Offenses in their Exercise"" (De Munerum EcclesiasticorumUsurpatione Degue Delictis iniis Exercendis). The canon in question isCanon 1382, which reads: ""A bishop who consecrates someone bishop andthe person who receives such a consecration from a bishop without apontifical mandate incur an automatic (latae sententiae)excommunication reserved to the Holy See.""The scandalous attempts to smear Archbishop Lefebvre with the offenseof schism are, then, contrary to both truth and charity. A comparablesmear under civil as opposed to ecclesiastical law would certainlyjustify legal action for libel involving massive damages. An accurateparallel would be to state that a man convicted of manslaughter hadbeen convicted of first degree murder.I must stress that what I have written here is not the dubious opinionof laymen unversed in the intricacies of Canon Law. Canon lawyerswithout the least shred of sympathy for Mgr. Lefebvre have repudiatedthe charge of schism made against him as totally untenable. FatherPatrick Yaldrini, Dean of the Faculty of Canon Law of the InstitutCatholique in Paris noted in the 4 July 1988 issue of Valeursactuelles that, as I have just explained, Mgr.  Lefebvre was notexcommunicated for schism but for the usurpation of an ecclesiasticalfunction. He added that it is not the consecration of a bishop whichconstitutes schism but the conferral of an apostolic mission upon theillicitly consecrated bishop. It is this usurpation of the powers ofthe sovereign pontiff which proves the intention of establishing aparallel Church.Cardinal Rosalio Lara, President of the Pontifical Commission for theAuthentic Interpretation of Canon Law, commented on the consecrationsin the 10 July 1988 issue of la Repubblica. It would be hard toimagine a more authoritative opinion. The Cardinal wrote:    The act of consecrating a bishop (without a papal mandate) is not    in itself a schismatic act. In fact, the Code that deals with    offenses is divided into two sections. One deals with offenses    against religion and the unity of the Church, and these are    apostasy, schism, and heresy. Consecrating a bishop with a    pontifical mandate is, on the contrary, an offense against the    exercise of a specific ministry. For example, in the case of the    consecrations carried out by the Vietnamese Archbishop Ngo Dinh    Thuc in 1976 and 1983, although the Archbishop was excommunicated    he was not considered to have committed a schismatic act because    there was no intention of a breach with the Church.....It is not simply unjust but ludicrous to suggest that in consecratingbishops without a papal mandate Archbishop Lefebvre had the leastintent of establishing a schismatic church. He is not a schismatic andwill never be a schismatic. The Archbishop considers correctly thatthe the Church is undergoing its worst crisis since the Arian heresy,and that for the good of the Church it was necessary for him toconsecrate the four bishops to ensure the future of his Society. CanonLaw provides for just such a situation, and even if one believes thatthe future of the Society could have been guaranteed without theseconsecrations, the fact that the Archbishop believed sincerely that itcould not means, as Canon Law states clearly, that he has not incurredexcommunication. Furthermore, while the Vatican allows such prelatesas Archbishop Weakland to undermine the Faith with impunity it cannotexpect Catholics to pay the least attention to its sanctions against agreat and orthodox Archbishop whose entire life has been devoted tothe service of the Church and the salvation of souls.Dr. Eric M. de Saventhem, President of the International Una VoceAssociation, is one of the best informed laymen in the Church, and heknows the Archbishop intimately. Dr. de Saventhem, like myself, has nogreater desire than to see a reconciliation between Mgr. Lefebvre andthe Holy See during the Archbishop's lifetime. A quotation from astatement by Dr. de Saventhem which was published in the 15 February1989 Remnant merits careful study:    In retrospect, the road leading to the consecrations of 30 June    appears more paved with grave Roman (and, unfortunately, also    papal) omissions than with Lefebvrist ""obstinancies."" And from the    eyes of an informed public this cannot be hidden by attempting to    present the Archbishop's act of grave disobedience as an offense    against the Faith!  It is said--today--that Mgr. Lefebvre has ""an    erroneous concept of Tradition."" If this were so, Cardinal    Ratzinger could not, on behalf of the Pope, have addressed to the    Archbishop the following words in his letter of 28 July 1987:    ""Your ardent desire to safeguard Tradition by procuring for it    'the means to live and prosper' testifies to your attachment to    the Faith of all time... the Holy Father understands your concern    and shares it."""	soc.religion.christian

Guidleines have been set on the number of dental x-rays and chest x-rays that one should have over a given period of time because of all the environmental factors that can cause cancer in humans, ionizing radiation is one of the most potent(splits DNA and causes hydroxyl free radical formation in tissue cells).  Ultasound(like that used in seeing the fetus in the uterus) has been shown to be extremely good at picking up tumors in the prostate and gallstones in the gallbladder.  But kidney tissue may be too dense for ultrasound to work for kidney stones(any radiologists care to comment?).Most stones will pass(but it's a very painful process).  Unlike gallstones, I don't think that there are many drugs that can help ""dissolve"" the kidney stone(which is probably calcium-oxalate).  Vitamin C and magnesium have worked in rabbits to remove calcium from calcified plaques in the aterial wall.  I have no idea if a diet change or supplementation could speed up the process of kidney stone passage(but I'm pretty confident that a diet change and/or supplementation can prevent a reoccurance).  If surgery is being contemplated, the stone must be in the kidney tubule.  A second opinion is a good idea because there are better(less damaging) ways to break up the stone if it's logged within the kidney(sonic blasts).  HMO's are notorious for conservative care and long waits for expensvie treatments.  My condolences to your friend. Marty B."	sci.med

Newsgroup:rec.autosDocument_id: 102770From: welty@cabot.balltown.cma.COM (richard welty)Subject: rec.autos: Frequently Asked QuestionsArchive-name: rec-autos/part4[this article is one of a pair of articles containing commonlyasked automotive questions; the other article contains questionsof general consumer interest, and is broken out to facilitatecrossposting to misc.consumers -- rpw][last change: 8 February 1993; CT now permits radar detector usage,    new tire-traction q&a -- rpw]                Commonly Asked QuestionsRadar Questions:Q:  Where are radar detectors illegal?A:  In the US, currently Virgina and the District of Columbia prohibit    all usage of radar detectors.  New York prohibits their use in    large trucks.  In Canada, they are illegal in Manitoba, Ontario,    Quebec, Newfoundland and PEI (Prince Edward Island).  They    are apparently are illegal through most, if not all, of Europe.    Legislation which would make them illegal is pending in many other    jurisdictions; chances of such legislation passing varies a great deal.Q:  Where are Radar Detector Detectors used?  Do they really work?A:  Usage is spreading rapidly; initially they were used only in Canada,    but now they are appearing in New York and Virginia.  It is unsafe    to assume that they are not in use in Connecticut and D.C.    They work by detecting a certain frequency radiated by many currently    available super Het radar detectors; some brands of detector radiate    more strongly than others, and are thus more likely to be spotted.    New radar detectors are becoming available which may not be detected    by the current generation of detector detectors.  Note that a    detector may only be spotted by one of these devices if it is turned    on.Q:  What is VASCAR?  Is it some kind of Radar?A:  VASCAR is nothing more than a fancy stopwatch and time-speed-distance    computer.  It depends on the operator pressing buttons as the target    vehicle passes landmarks.  No radar signals are emitted by a VASCAR    system.Q:  What is Ka band radar?  Where is it used?  Should a radar detector be    able to handle it? A:  Ka band has recently been made available by the FCC for use in the US    in so-called photo-radar installations.  In these installations, a    low-powered beam is aimed across the road at a 45 degree angle to the    direction of traffic, and a picture is taken of vehicles which the    radar unit determines to have been in violation of the speed limit.    Tickets are mailed to the owner of the vehicle.  Because of the low    power and the 45 degree angle, many people believe that a radar    detector cannot give reasonable warning of a Ka band radar unit,    although some manufacturers of radar detectors have added such    capability anyway.  The number of locales where photo-radar is in use    is limited, and some question the legality of such units.  Best advice:    learn what photo radar units look like, and keep track of where they    are used (or else, don't speed.)Q:  Do radar jammers work?  Are they legal?A:  Quick answer:  No, and Not in the USA.    Detailed answer:  Cheap radar jammers do not work well at all.    Jammers that work are expensive and usually the property of the    military.  Jammers are a major violation of the regulations of the    Federal Communications Commission of the USA.Driving technique and Vehicle Dynamics Questions:Q:  What are understeer and oversteer?A:  Understeer and oversteer are terms describing the behaviour of a    car while cornering near the `limit' (limit of adhesion, that is.)    Most drivers do not normally drive hard enough for these terms to    be descriptive of the situations they encounter.  Simply put, they    tell whether the car wants to go straight in a corner (steer `less',    or `understeer') or it wants to turn more in a corner (`oversteer'.)    Understeer is commonly designed into most production cars so that    untrained drivers, inadvertantly traveling too fast, won't get into    trouble.  Understeer may also be induced by using too much throttle    in a corner.  Oversteer is designed into some more performance    oriented cars; it may be induced by lifting on the throttle (Trailing    throttle oversteer, or TTO).  In extreme cases, lifting on the throttle    may induce so much oversteer that the car reacts by fishtailing or    spinning.    Some technical details:  in a corner at speed, the tires on the car    will develop what are called `slip angles'; the slip angle is the    angular difference between the direction that the car is traveling    and the direction that the steering wheel is directing the car to    travel.  In understeer, the front wheels have a greater slip angle    than the rear wheels.  In oversteer, the rear wheels have a greater    slip angle than the front wheels.Q: What is a rev-matched downshift?A: When downshifting, the engine must be rotating faster in the lower gear   than it was in the higher gear.  However, during a downshift, normally   you declutch and lift your foot from the throttle, so the revs drop   rather than increase.  In rev-matched downshift, you blip the throttle   before re-engaging the clutch so that the engine will already be up to   the new speed.  This results in a much smoother and faster downshift.Q: What does heel-and-toe mean?A: Heel-and-toe is a technique used to do a rev-matched downshift while   braking.  This is normally challenging, because you need the right foot   for both the brake and throttle.  It is called heel-and-toe because you   use one end of the foot on the brake, and the other on the throttle to   match revs for the downshift.  In many modern cars this is a misnomer;   often you must use the ball of the foot on the brake and the right side   on the throttle.   Note that some race car drivers will skip the clutch, and just use the   left foot on the brake and the right foot on the throttle, accomplishing   the same thing.Q: What is double-clutch downshifting?A: While your right foot is doing the above, your left foot can do one of   three things:  nothing, declutch once, or declutch twice.  The reason for   declutching twice is to match the speeds of the two shafts in the   transmission to the speed of the engine.  This is usually coupled with   rev-matching, so that while the engine is in neutral and the clutch   engaged, the throttle is blipped and both shafts of the transmission   speed up.   The procedure is as follows:   (0) declutch   (1) move gearshift lever to neutral   (2) engage clutch   (3) match revs   (4) declutch   (5) move gearshift lever to next lower gear   (6) engage clutch   This sounds like a lot of work, but with practice it becomes natural.   The problem that double-clutching solves is normally the function of the   synchronizers within the gearbox.  In transmissions without synchros or   with very worn synchros, double-clutching makes it much easier to shift.   Basically, if you double-clutch well, you are not using the synchros at   all.  This is generally unnecessary on street cars with synchros in good   condition.Q: What do the numbers for acceleration from 0-60, 1/4 mile, skidpad, and   slalom times in the Auto Magazines really mean?  May they be compared?A: In short, 1) not as much as the magazines want you to believe, and   2) almost never.   In more detail:  the acceleration numbers (0-60mph and 1/4 mile times   in the US) may be vaguely compared as long as they all come from the   same source.  Testing procedures vary so much from magazine to magazine   that comparing a Road & Track number to a Car & Driver number is quite   pointless.  Keep in mind, too, that the same variation applies from   driver to driver on the street; the driver is a major (often *the*   major) part of the equation.   Skidpads vary, and even if they didn't, skidpad figures are really   only tests of the stickiness of the stock tires; they change radically   when tire compounds change.  DO NOT make any assumptions about the   comparative handling of, say, two sports sedans based on skidpad numbers.   This is not to suggest that skidpads are without value, however. Skidpads   are an excellent educational tool at driving schools.  They are simply   of limited value in the comparison of anything except tires.   Slalom times are slightly more useful; they test some small parts of the   automobile's transient response.  However, they are also heavily influenced   by the stock rubber on the car, and they do not test many corners of the   car's envelope.  They DO NOT tell you all you need to know before making   a buying decision.  For example, they don't tell you what the rear end   of the car will do on a road which suddenly goes off-camber.  When a car   has an adjustable suspension, these tests are usually done in the `sport'   setting, which may be quite unsuitable for daily driving.  The list of   caveats could go on for page after page.Q: My buddy claims that wide tires don't make any difference, according   to his freshman physics textbook, and that you can't ever accelerate   or corner at more than 1.0G.  Does he know what he's talking about?A: 1) in short:  he hasn't got a clue.   2) in more detail: the equations for friction used in freshman physics   textbooks presume that the surfaces are smooth,  dry and non-deformable,   none of which properly apply to tire traction except in the case of a   stone cold tire on dry pavement which is far below its proper operating   temperature.   Pavement is _never_ smooth; it is always irregular to a greater or lesser   extent.  Tires, which are not really dry and solid (as rubber is a   substance which in its natural form is liquid, and which has only been   coerced into a semblance of solidity by chemical magic), deform to match   the surface of the pavement which a vehicle is traveling over.  In a tire   at operating temperature, grip is actually generated by shear stresses   inside the deformed rubber, and not by anything even remotely resembling   friction in the freshman physics sense of the term.  The colder a tire   is relative to its operating temperature, the closer its behaviour will   be to the traditional concept of friction; if much hotter than the its   proper operating temperature, the more likely the possibility of some   part of the tire actually ``reverting'' to liquid, which is mostly like   to happen deep in the tread, causing characteristic blisters and chunking.   (This latter, though, is almost completely unlikely to happen in normal   street driving, so unless you're a competition driver or do a lot of   high speed track driving, don't worry about it.)   Because tire traction is completely out of the domain of simple friction,   it does not obey the freshman physics equation at all; thus dragsters   accelerate at more than 1.0G and race cars corner and brake at more than   1.0G.  Because simple friction does not apply, it is actually possible   for different sized contact patches to generate differing amounts of   grip.  An actual analysis of tire behavior would require techniques   such as Finite Element Analysis, due to the complexity of the mechanism.Misc.

Porsche has extensive business dealings with VW/Audi,    which causes some confusion.  Since currently Porsche is in some    financial difficulty, there is a possibility that Mercedes or VW may    be interested in purchasing the company in the near future, but this    is only speculation at this time.-- richard welty        518-393-7228       welty@cabot.balltown.cma.com``Nothing good has ever been reported about the full rotation of  a race car about either its pitch or roll axis''  -- Carroll Smith	rec.autos

Backthen, it was *all-out* war, and Germany and Japan had to be squashed.After all, a million or more British had already died, hundreds of thousands of French, a couple hundread thousand or so Americans, and millions of Russians, not to mention a few million Jews, Poles, and other people of slavic descent in German concentration camps.

It is evident that the West, especially America,misjudged Hussein drastically.  But once Hussein invaded Kuwait and threatened to militarily corner a significant portion of the world'soil supply, he had to be stopped.  Sure the war could have beenprevented by judicious and concerted effort on the part of the Westbefore Hussein invaded Kuwait, but it is still *Hussein* who isresponsible for his decision to invade.

A charge, whichnews commentators said, was akin to attempted murder under Californialaw.  Based on what the prosecution was asking for, it's evident that the first jury decided that the officers were ""not guilty"".  Note, not ""not guilty"" of doing wrong, but ""not guilty"" of aggravated assault with the *intent* of inflicting serious bodily harm.  The seeds of the prosecutions defeat were in their own overconfidence in obtaining a verdict such that they went for the most extreme charge they could.If the facts as the news commentators presented them are true, thenI feel the ""not guilty"" verdict was a reasonable one.> > mathew> [ ""Thou shalt not kill... unless thou hast a pretty good reason for killing,>    in which case thou shalt kill, and also kill anyone who gets in the way,>    as unfortunately it cannot be helped."">                                    -- Jim Brown Bible for Loving Christians ]Thanks mathew, I like the quote.

At themoment models which do not rely on the assumption of some *spiritual* worldexisting are equally powerful to ones which assume the assumption of a*spiritual* world.  As the non-spiritual models has fewer assumptions itshould be the currently accepted models.The scientific process never assumes that its present models are thecorrect ones, whereas many religions claim to represent the truth.

(Poor you!)The Macroscrubber from Radio Electronics removes the protection so you souldn't have any more problems.  However, if you use the method of copying it from one VCR to another where the second VCR doesn't react to the protection, you will end up with a duplicate tape, including the protection.One thought comes to mind about your problem...  When playing the tape for viewing, are you feeding the signal from the source VCR through an extra device before going to the TV?  If you feed it through a second VCR first, that is your problem.  As to other devices such as converters, I don't know if they would react or not.  Just to be safe, you might want to make sure that you have NOTHING between the VCR and TV.victor@inqmind.bison.mb.caThe Inquiring Mind BBS, Winnipeg, Manitoba  204 488-1607	sci.electronics

(818) 354-5011Contact:  Mary A. HardinFOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE                              April 15, 1993#1506     Scientists at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory report thesuccessful flight of a balloon carrying instruments designed tomeasure and study chemicals in the Earth's ozone layer.     The April 3 flight from California's Barstow/Daggett Airportreached an altitude of 37 kilometers (121,000 feet) and tookmeasurements as part of a program established to correlate datawith the Upper Atmosphere Research Satellite (UARS).       The data from the balloon flight will also be compared toreadings from the Atmospheric Trace Molecular Spectroscopy(ATMOS) experiment which is currently flying onboard the shuttleDiscovery.     ""We launch these balloons several times a year as part of anongoing ozone research program.  In fact, JPL is activelyinvolved in the study of ozone and the atmosphere in threeimportant ways,"" said Dr. Jim Margitan, principal investigator onthe balloon research campaign.       ""There are two JPL instruments on the UARS satellite,"" hecontinued.  ""The ATMOS experiment is conducted by JPL scientists,and the JPL balloon research provides collaborative ground truthfor those activities, as well as data that is useful in its ownright.""     The measurements taken by the balloon payload will add morepieces to the complex puzzle of the atmosphere, specifically themid-latitude stratosphere during winter and spring. Understanding the chemistry occurring in this region helpsscientists construct more accurate computer models which areinstrumental in predicting future ozone conditions.     The scientific balloon payload consisted of three JPLinstruments:  an ultraviolet ozone photometer which measuresozone as the balloon ascends and descends through the atmosphere;a submillimeterwave limb sounder which looks at microwaveradiation emitted by molecules in the atmosphere; and a Fouriertransform infrared interferometer which monitors how theatmosphere absorbs sunlight.      Launch occurred at about noontime, and following a three-hour ascent, the balloon floated eastward at approximately 130kilometers per hour (70 knots).  Data was radioed to groundstations and recorded onboard.  The flight ended at 10 p.m.Pacific time in eastern New Mexico when the payload was commandedto separate from the balloon.     ""We needed to fly through sunset to make the infraredmeasurements,"" Margitan explained, ""and we also needed to fly indarkness to watch how quickly some of the molecules disappear.""     It will be several weeks before scientists will have thecompleted results of their experiments.  They will then forwardtheir data to the UARS central data facility at the Goddard SpaceFlight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland for use by the UARSscientists.         The balloon was launched by the National Scientific BalloonFacility, normally based in Palestine, Tex., operating under acontract from NASA's Wallops Flight Facility.  The balloon waslaunched in California because of the west-to-east wind directionand the desire to keep the operation in the southwest.     The balloons are made of 20-micron (0.8 mil, or less thanone-thousandth of an inch) thick plastic, and are 790,000 cubicmeters (28 million cubic feet) in volume when fully inflated withhelium (120 meters (400 feet) in diameter).  The balloons weighbetween 1,300 and 1,800 kilograms (3,000 and 4,000 pounds).  Thescientific payload weighs about 1,300 kilograms (3,000) poundsand is 1.8 meters (six feet) square by 4.6 meters (15 feet) high.     The JPL balloon research is sponsored by NASA's UpperAtmosphere Research Program and the UARS Correlative MeasurementsProgram.                                                      #####     ___    _____     ___    /_ /|  /____/ \  /_ /|     Ron Baalke         | baalke@kelvin.jpl.nasa.gov    | | | |  __ \ /| | | |     Jet Propulsion Lab | ___| | | | |__) |/  | | |__   M/S 525-3684 Telos | Being cynical never helps /___| | | |  ___/    | |/__ /| Pasadena, CA 91109 | to correct the situation |_____|/  |_|/       |_____|/                     | and causes more aggravation                                                  | instead."	sci.space

Some have the standard IBM BIOS video support forthe VGA 320x200 256 colour mode, but they leave out the other cards such asthe Hercules monochrome card (which by the way can give very good picturequality if your dithering works right).I can't remember the name of a JPEG viewer since I usually convert JPEG's toGIF's before viewing them. But some require VESA driver for the video cards.You don't need any special hardware to view JPEG's except perhaps for a VGAcard and maybe a 286+ processor. Most people these days program for 286+computers and neglect the rest of the 86 processors (8086, 8088). I have a8088 clone (a NEC V20 processor) and a Hercules card, I have had to writesome programs so that they will view GIF's and animations for the VGA and othercolour graphics boards on my monochrome Hercules card. I use Floyd-Steinbergdithers and have found that if one does something neat with the colour palettethe resulting dithered image gives much greater detail than it normally wouldwhen viewed on other monochrome systems. CompuShow 8.50 has FS dithering butit does the standard thing with the image palette before dithering, my waygives a brighter more detailed image.Anyway, enough of my rambling in the wrong direction. The final point is, asfar as I know, you don't need extra hardware to view JPEG's other than theVGA (and perhaps a 286 or better)Have a day!Gerry.	comp.graphics

Unfortunately I don't have direct quotes handy...1) Atheists believe that when they die, they die forever.2) A god who would condemn those who fail to believe in him to eternal death   is unfair.  I don't see what the problem is!  To Christians, Hell is, by definition, eternal death--exactly what atheists are expecting when they die.  There's noreason Hell has to be especially awful--to most people, eternal death is badenough.

Reproduced under open license granted by AudioBooks, Inc.-----------------------------------------------------------------This is the Dr. Beter AUDIO LETTER(R), 1629 K St. NW, Washington,DC  20006.   Hello, my friends, this is Dr. Beter.  Today is April 30,1982, and this is my AUDIO LETTER(R) No. 74.  It's now been almost one month since war broke out in the SouthAtlantic.  On the surface it seems that it's only a disputebetween Argentina and Great Britain over the barren, wind-sweptFalkland Islands and South Georgia Island.  In reality, it's farmore than that.   The so-called Falklands crisis is just the visible tip of agiant military operation.  During this month of April 1982,fierce naval battles have taken place--not only in the SouthAtlantic but also in the South Pacific.  Up to now most of thehostilities have been kept under wraps by wartime censorship onall sides.  But as I say these words, the naval war in theSouthern Hemisphere is about to come to the surface.   Beginning today, April 30, a total naval and air blockade ofthe Falklands by the Royal Navy has begun.  At the same time acounterblockade has been declared by Argentina in the same area.   To be effective, a blockade must be imposed over a period oftime, but the Royal Navy does not have that much time.  Winter iscoming on in the South Atlantic, and the British supply lines areoverextended.  Having come this far, Her Majesty's navy cannotsimply drop the blockade and sail away in a few weeks timewithout drawing blood from Argentina.  As a result the Britishwill be forced to undertake military operations very soon nomatter how risky they may be.   There is also another reason why the Royal Navy now has nochoice but to engage the Argentine forces in combat.  Thatreason, my friends, is that the Royal Navy has already sufferedlosses in secret combat this month.  Up to this moment there willbe no way to explain away the damage which has been sustained bythe British fleet.  Only when publicly admitted fighting eruptswill the British dare to admit that they have suffered battlelosses.  To obtain that cover story, the British have no choicebut to sail into combat; but in doing so, they will be riskingeven heavier losses on top of those already sustained.  In short,my friends, Her Majesty's navy has sailed into a trap.   The events now unfolding in the South Atlantic carry strange,ironic echoes of the past.  For weeks now we've been hearingcountless commentators referring to the British task force as an""armada"" (quote).  The British of all people ought to be veryuneasy with that description.  The original Spanish Armada 400years ago was renowned as a seemingly invincible fighting force,but it came to grief in a naval disaster so complete that itchanged the course of history--and it was none other than theEnglish navy that destroyed the Spanish Armada.   The original Spanish Armada put to sea in 1588 during thereign of England's Queen Elizabeth I.  The Armada was an invasionfleet carrying thousands of crack fighting men to invade England. They were met by the daring sea dogs of Sir Francis Drake.  Drakeand his small, fast ships turned the tables on the Spanish Armadaby changing the rules of battle.  The English fleet was equippedwith new longer-range guns, and it stayed upwind and out ofreach.  From there the English pounded, smashed, and shatteredthe big ships of the mighty Armada.  When it was all over, barelyhalf the Spanish fleet was left to limp back to port.  Drake'sdefeat of the Spanish Armada was a shock to the world.  It openedthe door for England under Queen Elizabeth I to start itsexpansion into a truly global empire.   Today, 400 years later, history seems to have come fullcircle.  Queen Elizabeth II is witnessing the dismantling of theworld empire whose heyday began under Queen Elizabeth I, and nowthe cultures of England and of Spain are once again inconfrontation.  Once again a so-called armada is preparing forinvasion, but this time the armada is British, not Spanish.  Fourhundred years ago Sir Francis Drake was the hero of the day;today, the ghost of Francis Drake is once again on the scene.   The South Atlantic war zone is at the eastern end of the DrakePassage around the southern tip of South America.  The defeat ofthe Spanish Armada four centuries ago broke the back of Spain'snaval supremacy, and now the defeat of the new British armada maywell break the back of what remains of the once glorious RoyalNavy.   My three special topics for this AUDIO LETTER are:Topic #1--THE MILITARY SECRET OF SOUTH GEORGIA ISLANDTopic #2--THE SECRET NAVAL WAR OF THE SOUTHERN HEMISPHERETopic #3--THE ROCKEFELLER FEAR CAMPAIGN AGAINST NUCLEAR WAR.Topic #1--When the Falkland Islands crisis began early this monthit looked at first like a tempest in a teapot.  For a century anda half since 1833, the Islands have been controlled by GreatBritain.  During that entire time, British sovereignty over theFalklands has been disputed by Argentina.  There have beencountless threats by Argentina to seize the Islands, which itcalls the Malvinas, but the threats have always come to nothingin the past and Britain has never even gotten very worried aboutthem.   The Islands are four times as distant from Argentina as Cubais from the United States, and they are not much of a prize. After 150 years of occupancy, the Falklands are home to fewerthan 2,000 British settlers and a lot of sheep.  In short, theremote Falkland Islands hardly look like something to fight over,and yet here we are watching another crisis take place.  We arewatching as war erupts between Great Britain and Argentina.   The Thatcher government is acting as if it has forgotten allabout its usual preoccupation with the Soviet threat at NATO'sdoorstep.  Instead, Britain is throwing almost everything it'sgot at Argentina---aircraft carriers, cruisers, destroyers,submarines, assault ships--you name it.  Luxury cruise ships haveeven been commissioned and turned into troop carriers overnight. Wave after wave of additional assault troops have been activatedand sent to join the fleet even after it sailed.  Ships andsubmarines have been pulled off station from normal NATO duty andsent to reinforce the task force.  The initial 40-ship force hasgrown steadily over the past several weeks into an armadanumbering over 70.  Over two-thirds of the entire Royal Navy hasalready been deployed to the South Atlantic off Argentina.   Watching all this, a lot of people are asking: What's thisfight really all about?  The most popular answer suggested in themajor media is ""oil.""  Vast deposits of oil are known to existunder the continental shelf between Argentina and the Falklands,but that has been known for nearly 10 years.  In no way does itexplain the timing of the sudden military offensive by Argentinathis month, and oil explains even less about the Argentineseizure of South Georgia Island.   South Georgia Island is 800 miles east of the Falklands withno known oil deposits anywhere near it; and compared to SouthGeorgia, the Falklands are an island paradise.  South GeorgiaIsland is covered with rugged mountains, treacherous valleys,glaciers, and semi-permanent snow.  Most of it is uninhabitable. On top of all that, Argentina has absolutely no legal orhistorical claim to South Georgia Island.  In that respect itstands in sharp contrast to the Falklands.   In the early 1830s the Falklands were occupied for a while byArgentine colonists.  In 1833 the British expelled them and tookover the Island.  For that and other historical reasons,Argentina argues that the Falklands really belong to Argentina,not Britain.   But no such argument is possible for South Georgia Island.  Ithas always been controlled by Britain, never by Argentina orSpain.  The Argentine seizure of South Georgia Island looks evenmore unreasonable from a military point of view.  Argentina'sleaders are military men and they think in military terms.  Theywere well aware ahead of time that far-off South Georgia Islandcould not possibly be held for long.  By seizing it they weresetting themselves up to absorb a military defeat, as the Islandwas retaken by Britain.  So the question is: Why did Argentina'smilitary junta bother with the seemingly worthless South GeorgiaIsland at all?   My friends, the answers to all these questions are military,not political or economic.  South Georgia Island possesses anenormous military secret.  It's a giant underground installationburied under the mountains at the northwest end of the Island. The real reason for the so-called Falkland crisis is this secretinstallation, together with two other similar installations whichI will describe shortly.   The secret military complexes have been in existence for manyyears; they are not new.  What is new is the accelerated nuclearwar timetable of the American Bolshevik war planners here inWashington.  For the past two months I've been reporting thedetails of this new war plan to you as quickly as I can obtainand verify them.   The plan calls for NUCLEAR WAR ONE to erupt by September ofthis year 1982!!  It is this fast-approaching nuclear war threatthat caused the so-called Falklands crisis to erupt now.   What is going on now is a coordinated effort to spoil part ofthe Bolshevik grand strategy for the coming nuclear war.  Themutual enemies of the American Bolsheviks here--namely, theRockefeller cartel--and Russia's new rulers in the Kremlin arebehind the present crisis.  They are trying to ruin Phase #3 ofthe ""PROJECT Z"" war plan which I revealed last month.  That phaseis to be world domination by the American Bolsheviks after bothRussia and the United States have been destroyed in NUCLEAR WARONE.  As I mentioned last month, the key to this plan is theexistence of secret weapons stockpiles in various places aroundthe world.   The American Bolshevik military planners here in America areworking with other Bolshevik agents in key military positions ofother countries to set off war.  Having done that, they intend toride out the nuclear holocaust they have caused, safe and cozy inGovernment war bunkers!  When the warring nations finally liesmoldering and exhausted, the Bolsheviks will leave the shatteredremains of their host countries.  They will rendezvous at thesecret weapons installations and bring their weapons into theopen.  They will confront the world with the only remainingfresh, up-to-date, powerful military force on earth; and usingthat military power, they will become the undisputed rulers ofthe world--that is, they plan to do all this, and they plan topave the way for world domination very soon by setting offNUCLEAR WAR ONE in a matter of months.  The Rockefeller carteland Russia's new anti-Bolshevik rulers are working together in arace against time to try to head off the Bolshevik war plan.   Last month I mentioned that the Bolsheviks here arebenefitting from war preparations which were started by theRockefellers long ago.  It has only been about three years sincethe Rockefellers were dislodged as the prime movers of the UnitedStates Government by the Bolsheviks.  Since that time the UnitedStates Government has been a house divided, torn by internalpower struggles between rival Bolshevik and Rockefeller factions. But before that, the United States had been dominated for decadesboth economically and politically by the Four RockefellerBrothers.   In 1961 the Brothers launched a new long-range plan for worlddomination.  It was a two-prong strategy, half visible and halfsecret, which I first described long ago in AUDIO LETTER No. 28. It was a plan for the United States to arm to the teeth in secretwhile appearing to disarm gradually.  Without repeating all thedetails, the basic idea was grandiose yet simple.  Bydeliberately appearing weak, the Rockefeller-controlled UnitedStates would maneuver itself into a nuclear war with Russia. Then the secret weapons, including superweapons, would beunleashed to smash Russia and take over the world.   When they set the grand plan in motion in 1961, theRockefeller Brothers were looking ahead to a nuclear war by thelate 1970s.  Their military analysts concluded very early thatthe war being planned would have very different effects on theNorthern and Southern Hemispheres.  Both superpowers, the UnitedStates and the Soviet Union, are located well up in the NorthernHemisphere; so are the other full-fledged nuclear powers--GreatBritain, France, Red China, and India.  By contrast, thestrategic targets for nuclear war in the Southern Hemisphere arerelatively few and far between.  In other words, it was expectedthat the coming nuclear war would be essentially a NorthernHemisphere war.   In an all-out nuclear holocaust it is known that seriousradioactive fallout will gradually spread to affect even areasnot initially hit by war.  But there are limits to how far thewar clouds can spread.  It was discovered long ago that there isvery little mixing between the air of the Northern and SouthernHemispheres.  In the northern half of our planet, cold air fromthe North Pole works its way southward towards the equator, thenit works its way back to the north as warm air.  A mirror imageof this process takes up the southern half of the planet. Northern and Southern Hemisphere air meet in the equatorial zone,but very little of the air changes places.   The military conclusion, my friends, is this: the comingnuclear war could ruin large areas of the Northern Hemisphere forgenerations to come; but if the calculations are right, theSouthern Hemisphere could escape virtually unaffected by the war. This was music to the ears of the Four Rockefeller Brothers.  Aquick look at the globe of the world shows why.  The Rockefellercartel has dominated Latin America ever since World War II.  As Idiscussed in my very first monthly AUDIO LETTER, NelsonRockefeller solidified the cartel grip on Latin America duringthe war.  He accomplished this as so-called ""Coordinator ofHemispheric Defense"" for then-President Franklin D. Roosevelt. So that takes care of the South American continent and itsnatural resources.   Then there is the African continent.  There, too, Rockefellercontrol was already in effect over wide areas of Black Africa,especially south of the equator.  All this was thanks to theefforts of John D. Rockefeller III, as I detailed in AUDIO LETTERNo. 36.   Looking around the globe, the most important remaining landmasses from the standpoint of world domination are Australia andNew Zealand.  Thanks to World War II, both were wide open to theRockefellers.   The Rockefeller Brothers decided to establish secret militaryinstallations in the Southern Hemisphere for use after the comingwar.  By this means they expected to become the masters of thesurviving southern half of planet Earth after the NorthernHemisphere war.  Then, as the Northern Hemisphere graduallyrecovered from the nuclear holocaust, the Rockefeller empirewould be able to pick up the pieces.  In this way the thirdgeneration Rockefeller Brothers expected their family dynasty toinherit the Earth.   In order to control the Southern Hemisphere militarily afterthe war, some means would have to be available to projectmilitary power onto any land mass.  For example, revolts againstRockefeller domination would require troops--not a blast from thebeam weapons on the Moon.  The most critical factor for postwarmilitary domination of the world was found to be a navy.  Aminimum of two secret naval fleets would be required--one basedin the South Atlantic, the other in the South Pacific.  Since thereserve naval fleets were to be kept secret until after theNorthern Hemisphere nuclear war, they could not be built inexisting shipyards.  New construction facilities had to be builtand they had to be hidden.  To hide an entire shipyard is nosmall task; they take up a lot of space.  On top of that, it wasessential that the ships remain hidden after they were built. The best way to achieve that was to combine the shipyard andnaval base into one over-all secret installation.  Finally, thesecret naval installation had to be invulnerable to nuclearattack; otherwise if its existence were ever discoveredprematurely, the secret navy might be wiped out.   The combined requirements for secrecy, space, and protectionagainst attack were formidable; but one day in 1959, while allthese plans were still in the early stages of development, theanswer presented itself.  During a so-called banking trip toSweden, David Rockefeller was given a tour of a unique hiddennaval port.  The port is hollowed out from solid granite cliffswhich come right down to the water.  The entrance to the port isa gigantic hole in the side of the cliff which can be sealed offwith enormous steel doors.  Inside this big doorway on the watera huge cavity has been hollowed out to accommodate ships.   The Rockefeller Brothers and their military adviser decidedthat a bigger, more secret, better protected version of theSwedish hidden port was just what they wanted.  A survey ofcandidate sites was then initiated.  The site survey coveredcoastal areas throughout the Southern Hemisphere.  Many areaswere rejected very quickly because the topography was wrong. Other areas were rejected because they were too close to theequator.  Still others had to be ruled out because there were toomany people living nearby, making the desired level of secrecyimpossible.  Finally, it was essential that the sites chosen forthe secret naval installations be totally secure politically.   At last the sites for the secret naval installations wereselected.  In the South Pacific, extreme southern New Zealand wasselected.  This is what I was alluding to in AUDIO LETTER No. 71three months ago when I called attention to New Zealand's extremeimportance in the coming war.   In order to obtain the necessary space, the secret New Zealandnaval installation had to be divided up into two sites locatedclose together.  One is at the extreme southwest tip of SouthIsland where the mountain range known as the Southern Alps comesdown virtually to the water's edge.  The other part of theinstallation is built into the northwest tip of Stewart Island,which is off the tip of South Island.  The Stewart Islandfacility is hollowed out within a rise known as Mt. Anglem.   The New Zealand location met all the requirements.  Ever sinceWorld War II the government of New Zealand has been tied evencloser to the United States than to Great Britain.  The locationis far from the equator, and the installations are buried deepunder mountains, protected from nuclear attack.  They are alsotoo deep to be reached by particle-beam attacks, and the NewZealand site is well situated to command the entire SouthPacific.   In the South Atlantic an even more perfect site was found. That site, my friends, is South Georgia Island.  It is locatedperfectly for naval domination of the entire South Atlantic.  Thetall, rugged mountains provided a perfect location for the secretinstallation at the northwest tip of the 100-mile long island. It is controlled by Great Britain whose government, like that ofNew Zealand, was willing to cooperate; and South Georgia Islandwas virtually uninhabited except for a whaling station on thenortheast coast.  The whaling station was some 50 miles away fromthe secret new installation which was being built, but Britaintook no chances.  In 1965 the whaling station was closed down. Since that time there have been no inhabitants on South GeorgiaIsland except for a few dozen alleged Antarctic scientists.   Construction of the secret naval facilities--two in NewZealand, one on South Georgia Island--began in the early 1960's. The techniques were adapted from those used previously to buildother large underground facilities, such as the NORADinstallation inside Cheyenne Mountain, Colorado; however thesetechniques were adapted in radically new ways to achieveconstruction access directly from the sea instead of overland. In this way, the sheltering mountain was left undisturbed inappearance both during and after construction.   The cuts in the mountain side which were necessary to letships in and out were kept as small as possible and were wellcamouflaged.  Like the Swedish hidden naval port arrangement, theentrances to the secret installations can be sealed up.  Whensealed, the entrance is virtually impossible to detect unless youknow exactly where it is; and unlike most large constructionprojects, there are no tailings or piles of leftover rock lyingaround to attract attention.  The man-made caverns which housethe secret naval installations are enormous, but all the rock anddebris was disposed of at sea.   Once the secret naval facilities were built, they had to beoutfitted for ship construction and docksite storage.  The fakedisarmament of the United States during the 1960s contributedgreatly to this task.  From 1961 to 1968 one man played a pivotalrole in this elaborate Rockefeller scheme.  He was then-Secretaryof Defense Robert McNamara.  All through the 60's McNamarapresided over the public paring back of America's visiblemilitary power.  This included the closing down and dismantlingof entire shipyards.  What we were not told was where all thatshipyard equipment went afterwards.  Where it went, my friends,was to the new secret installations which were being outfitted inNew Zealand and South Georgia Island!   The secret naval installations have been used as duplicationfacilities to reproduce certain ships and submarines designed andbuilt here in the United States.  As Defense Secretary CasparWeinberger told Congress recently, it is cheaper to build twoships at a time.  That is especially true if the second ship isan exact duplicate of the first.  This has become even more truein recent years through the use of computerized manufacturingtechniques.   The secret naval fleets which have been built at the secretinstallations are made up of duplicates--exact duplicates ofcertain other ships and submarines.  They are all nuclearpowered--nuclear ""subs""; nuclear cruisers; nuclear destroyers;and yes, nuclear aircraft carriers, three of them.  A secret twinwas built for the U.S.S. Nimitz, for the U.S.S. Eisenhower, andfor the newly-launched U.S.S. Carl Vincent.  All have beenfinanced through the gigantic cost overruns, so called, that weconstantly hear about in the Defense Department; and all threecarriers have been provided with a full complement of aircraftwhose manufacture was financed the same way!   The ships of the secret American Bolshevik naval fleets areall duplicates of other nuclear-powered vessels.  Even so, thesecret naval ships possess one key difference.   Last month I revealed that the so-called ""Stealth Program"" hassucceeded in developing a kind of electromagnetic invisibilityshield.  This technique makes an object invisible from a distanceby distorting light waves in its vicinity.   A whole new fleet of Phantom war-planes are now going intocrash production that use this principle; and, my friends, all ofthe secret American Bolshevik navy ships have already beenoutfitted with similar Stealth-field equipment!  The Stealthprinciple is actually easier to apply to ships than to airplanesbecause there is more room for the powerful equipment thatgenerates the field.   After NUCLEAR WAR ONE, the secret Stealth navy of the AmericanBolsheviks would be light years ahead of any other navy left onearth.  It would be perfect for the intended role of worlddomination.  The Rockefellers set it all in motion long ago, myfriends, but three years ago they lost control of the UnitedStates Military.  Now it's the American Bolsheviks who are incontrol, and they are bent on war.   These secret naval installations have precipitated what isbeing called the ""Falklands crisis.""Topic #2--In AUDIO LETTER(R) No. 73 last month I described""PROJECT Z"", the new Bolshevik three-phase strategy for NUCLEARWAR ONE.   An elite group of American Bolshevik military planners hereare flushing out the plan right now at a secret war-room here inWashington.  It's a plan by which the United States will strikethe first nuclear blow, followed by all-out thermonuclear warwith Russia.   Having set off the holocaust, the Bolsheviks here and incertain other countries plan to rise it out safe in comfortablewar bunkers.  Finally after NUCLEAR WAR ONE fizzles out instalemate, they plan to leave behind the ashes of the UnitedStates and her allies.  Activating Phase #3 of their grandstrategy, they plan to unveil their secret weapons, especiallytheir secret naval fleets.  With these they plan to conquer andrule what is left of the world.  The United States as we know itwill be dead and gone; but in the eyes of the Bolsheviksthemselves, this outcome will constitute victory.   Up to now the nuclear war timetable which I first revealed twomonths ago is still on track.  They are still shooting fornuclear war to begin by September of this year 1982!  Time isfast running out.   The Bolsheviks here are sprinting as fast as they can towardwar; but, my friends, the Bolsheviks are not the only runners inthis race.  They have two deadly enemies, both of whom areequally determined to trip up the Bolsheviks.  One enemy of theBolsheviks here is the Rockefeller cartel; the other enemy is thenew anti-Bolshevik ruling clique in Russia; and now these twomutual enemies of the Bolsheviks are pooling their efforts incertain ways.   In AUDIO LETTER No. 71 three months ago I reported that alimited, new anti-Bolshevik coalition was in the works betweenthe Rockefeller cartel and the Russians.  The January 26 meetingbetween Haig and Gromyko in Geneva, Switzerland, was a turningpoint in the formation of this coalition.  It is now a reality,and is responsible for the so-called ""Falkland crisis"" nowdominating the headlines.  It should be emphasized that this newrelationship between the Rockefeller cartel and Russia falls farshort of a true alliance.  They have very major disputes to besettled between them, but for the time being they have called atruce between themselves to deal with their mutual deadlyenemy--the Bolsheviks here in America.   The first priority of the Russians and the Rockefellers is toslow down the Bolshevik preparations for imminent nuclear war. If they can do that, time is on the side of the Rockefellercartel in certain political movements which I discussed lastsummer in AUDIO LETTER No. 67.  A slow-down in the nuclear wartimetable will also give more breathing space for additionalanti-Bolshevik actions to be implemented.   The joint Rockefeller-Russian planners decided by mid-Februarythat military action against the Bolsheviks was essential veryquickly.  No other type of action had any hope of taking effectfast enough to prevent nuclear war by the end of this summer.   The exact details of the ""PROJECT Z"" war plan are not known toeither the Rockefellers or the Russians, but the general outlinesare known to be as I described last month.   It was decided that military action should be devised thatwould undermine Phase #3 of the Bolshevik war plan--that is, theBolshevik-controlled secret naval installations and fleets in theSouthern Hemisphere should be attacked and crippled.  By workingtogether, the Rockefeller cartel and the Russians were able todevise an attack plan which neither could have carried out alone. The Rockefeller group, who built and originally controlled thesebases, provided detailed Intelligence about the best way toattack them.  The Russians with their enormous military machineprovided the muscle to actually carry out the attack.   It was essential to devise a scheme that would enable bothsecret fleets in the South Atlantic and South Pacific to beattacked.  Survival intact of either fleet would leave theBolshevik war plan still workable.   Military analysts concluded very quickly that a direct assaulton the New Zealand facilities was out of the question.  There wasno combination of commandos, frogmen, or other military forcewhich could possibly keep an attack secret from the outsideworld.  Any attack on the New Zealand bases would set off thevery war which the Rockefellers and Russians want to prevent.   But the situation in the South Atlantic was a differentmatter.  In a way, the greatest asset of South Georgia Island wasalso its Achilles' heel.  The extreme isolation which protectedthe secrecy of the South Georgia base also made a covert militaryassault feasible.  The key lay with Argentina and herlong-standing claims to the Falkland Islands.   As I mentioned in Topic #1, the Rockefeller cartel hasdominated all of Latin America for decades.  Cartel operativeswere sent to Argentina to work out a deal with the governmentmilitary junta there.  The historic dispute over the FalklandIslands was to be used to provide a ruse, a military cover, toenable the South Georgia base to be attacked.  The Argentinegenerals were not told everything about the situation by anymeans, but they were told enough to make clear what they were todo.   As an inducement to cooperate, the Argentine leaders werepromised handsome rewards.  They were guaranteed that after theshooting was over, the Falkland Islands would remain in Argentinehands.  This guarantee included the promise of covert militaryassistance as needed against the Royal Navy.  And to bolster thetroubled Argentine economy, it was promised that the Rockefellercartel will help develop the immense offshore oil reserves.  Withthese combined promises of military glory and financial rewards,the Argentine military junta agreed to the plan.   On March 19 Argentina carried out Act #1 in the joint attackplan.  A group of Argentine scrap-metal merchants, of all things,landed at the abandoned old whaling station on South GeorgiaIsland.  Supposedly they were there to dismantle the oldbuildings and cart them off to sell.  While they were at it theyalso raised the Argentine flag over the work-site.  The British,always nervous about South Georgia Island, promptly reacted asexpected.  The British Antarctic survey ship ""Endurance"" put 22Marines ashore.  They drove off the scrap merchants and tore downthe Argentine flag.   The incident provided the desired excuse for the ArgentineJunta to bring the simmering 150-year-old Falklands dispute to aboil.  From time to time in the past, Argentina has claimed thatSouth Georgia is part of the Falklands because it is administeredthat way by Britain.  That argument is very flimsy but it nowcame in very handy.  It was nothing new to hear this fromArgentine leaders, so there was no hint of what was really afoot.   During late March, Argentine military forces startedassembling for an assault on the Falklands.  ""Nothing new"",thought the British high command.  Argentina has carried outthreatening maneuvers in the past many times.  It was believedthat they were about to do it again; but on April 2 Argentineforces did the unexpected.  After many past false alarms, thistime they actually invaded and seized the Islands.  All Argentinepublic statements emphasized the long-standing historical claimsto the Falklands themselves; but just for good measure, the nextday a small Argentine force also seized far-off South GeorgiaIsland.  The force was so small that it gave the appearanceinitially that it was just a side show from Argentina's point ofview; however, the small contingent of 22 Royal Marines wereoverpowered and bundled off the Island along with a group of 13alleged scientists.  That was the moment of payoff in the jointRockefeller-Russian attack plan.   Thanks to the elaborate distraction staged by the Argentineforces, a special commando team got onto the Island undetected. Based on the detailed Rockefeller information about the base, theteam moved to a location on the mountain directly above thecavernous secret base.  Special high-speed drilling equipment wasset up by the Rockefeller members of the team while the Russianmembers concentrated on military defense.  By late that evening,April 3, the military high command in London finally learned whatwas really taking place.  The secret South Georgia base was underattack by virtually the only means possible.  The jointRockefeller-Russian team were drilling a shaft down through themountain toward the hollowed out cavern inside.  It was only amatter of time until their drill would break through the ceilingof the giant hidden naval base.  Once the hole was made, the nextstep was obvious.  The Rockefeller-Russian team would put aweapon of some kind through the hole.  The best guess was that itwould be a nerve gas.   The shock waves that went through the highest levels of theBritish government on the evening of April 3 can hardly bedescribed, my friends.  The Thatcher government, like theso-called Reagan Administration here in America, is Bolshevikcontrolled.  That's why Margaret Thatcher always says, ""Me, too""any time the Reagan Administration says or does anything againstRussia.  Both governments are party to the secret nuclear warplan in complete betrayal of the people of their respectivecountries, and on the evening of April 3 they suddenly discoveredthat their precious war plan was in deep, deep trouble.   Immediately the Thatcher government started assembling a navalarmada to sail for the South Atlantic.  Haste was the order ofthe day.  The drilling on South Georgia Island was proceedingaround the clock.  The best estimates were that the drillingwould break through into the roof of the naval base in aboutthree weeks, on or about April 24.  If help did not reach SouthGeorgia by then, the secret installation might be doomed.  Theforces stationed at the installation itself were unable to defendthemselves under the circumstances.  Their mighty naval shipswere ships in a bottle.  They did not dare open the bottle tosail out to fight because the Russian commandos were armed withtactical and nuclear weapons.  To open the blast-proof entrancedoors would be suicide.   On April 5, just two days after South Georgia Island wasseized, some 40 naval ships began moving out of British ports. The same day Lord Carrington was sacked as Foreign Minister.  Hewas forced to resign, my friends, because he had assisted theRockefeller attack plan by downplaying the Argentine attackpreparations.   That same day, April 5, New Zealand, the home of the othersecret naval fleet, broke diplomatic relations with Argentina. The two hidden New Zealand facilities had been placed on ""RedAlert.""  As a precautionary measure, all submarines at the twinbase were ordered to sea.  Several surface ships were already atsea undergoing ""sea trials"", but that still left seven (7) majorships inside the hidden twin naval base including one of thenuclear aircraft carriers I mentioned earlier.   On that busy day of April 5, Argentina's Foreign Minister,Costa Mendez, was at the United Nations in New York.  He wasalarmed by the deployment of such a large part of the Royal Navy. Costa Mendez hurried here to Washington to seek reassurances fromcertain officials.  He got them!   For the next two weeks or so the news was filled with storiesabout the allegedly slow movement of the British fleet whilenegotiations went on.  That, my friends, was only a cover story. The Royal Navy was actually joining up and moving as rapidly aspossible toward South Georgia Island.  If the task force arrivedin time to save the secret base, a major battle was likely.  Theofficial stories about ""slow movement"" of the British armada wereintended to give a cushion of time for that battle.  If need be,the fleet would have several days to retake South Georgia Island,then it could move on to arrive near the Falklands on theannounced schedule.  In this way the crucial importance of SouthGeorgia Island would be hidden and the big secret preserved.   It was initially expected that advance elements of the Britishfleet would reach the vicinity of South Georgia Island within twoweeks.  That would have been soon enough to attack the jointRockefeller-Russian commando team and stop the drilling before itwas completed.  But Russian Cosmospheres and submarines made ashambles of the plan.   Key advance elements of the South Georgia attack contingentleft Ascension Island early April 14, two days before it wasannounced officially.  Shortly after they did so, they ran intotrouble.  Russian Cosmospheres and attack submarines closed in ona single ship which was critical to the planned counterassault onSouth Georgia Island.  The Cosmospheres bombarded the bridge andcombat information center of the ship with neutron radiation.  Inmoments the ship was without any command, its communications andradar silenced.  Then a Russian ""sub"" closed in and quicklyfinished off this key British ship with torpedoes.  It brokeapart with secondary explosions and sank rapidly.  So far as isknown, there were no survivors.   This unexpected shock in the mid-Atlantic produced tworesults, both important:First, it caused a slowdown in the race toward the South Atlanticby the British armada.  The task force had to be regrouped into aconfiguration better suited for an enroute defense, but that costvaluable time.  Public announcements from London about theprogress of the fleet reflected this slowdown.  The timetable forarrival on battle stations near the Falklands started stretchingout longer and longer.  All this bought extra time for the jointcommando team on South Georgia Island.  The drilling continued.The other result of the sinking was equally important.  Word wasflashed to the South Pacific Stealth navy to prepare for possibleaction.  It was obvious that the Russian Navy was gettinginvolved in the Atlantic, which meant that the Royal Navy couldbe in big trouble.  During the dead of night, early April 15, theseven Stealth ships put to sea from their twin secret bases insouthern New Zealand.  They deployed to a secret operationalheadquarters area in the Antipodes Islands, 450 miles southeastof New Zealand.  Their electromagnetic shields were operating toprovide protection from attack.  These shields make it impossibleto communicate with the outside world or even to see it, as Iexplained last month; but once they arrived at the Antipodes, theStealth ships hooked up to buoys equipped with shieldedcommunication cables to the Island headquarters.  The Antipodesheadquarters, in turn, was in constant touch with the SouthGeorgia base by way of a transoceanic cable around the tip ofSouth America.  The deployment of the available ships of theSouth Pacific Stealth fleet was exactly what the jointRockefeller-Russian planners had hoped for.  The ships had beenflushed out from their essentially invulnerable hiding place inNew Zealand!   The British ship's sinking of April 14 was also followed byother events.  On April 15 the Argentine Navy started moving outof port.  The same day, Alexander Haig arrived again in BuenosAires.  Supposedly he was there as a diplomat, but in reality hewas there as a General, dealing with Generals.  Haig is the topGovernmental operative of the Rockefeller cartel, as I haverevealed in the past.  He was making sure that the Argentines didnot get cold feet and back down at that critical moment.  Fourdays later, April 19, Haig left for Washington.  As he boardedhis plane, Haig somberly told reporters, ""Time is running out."" And so it was, my friends, for the secret South Georgia base.   The very next day, April 20, the drill broke through into thehollowed-out cavern of the naval base.  Bolshevik militaryanalysts in London had not expected that it could be completeduntil at least the following weekend.  The British fleet wasstill out of range.   The weapon which the commando team inserted down through thelong hole was a small, compact Russian neutron bomb.  When it wasdetonated inside the confines of the huge artificial cave, theeffects were devastating.  The intense radiation instantly killedeveryone inside the base.  Also the heat and blast effects of thebomb are believed to have damaged all the ships insidesufficiently to badly disable them.   Meanwhile, Russian Cosmospheres and submarines were convergingon the Stealth ships which were near the Antipodes Islandsawaiting orders.  From a distance, the ships were invisible tothe eye due to their protective shields, which also protectagainst beam-weapon attack; but they were sitting ducks for thetactics which the Russians employed.   Floating overhead, the Cosmospheres located the seven shipsusing their Psychoenergetic Range-Finding equipment known as PRF. As I have reported in the past, there is no method known by whichPRF can be jammed.  The Cosmospheres radioed the exact locationsof the ships to the attack submarines.  The ""subs"" were armedwith special non-homing, non-nuclear torpedoes designed toexplode on impact.  More sophisticated torpedoes would have beenthrown off course or detonated prematurely by the protectiveshield of each ship; but these simple torpedoes just cruise rightthrough each invisibility field to strike the ship and explode. Within 15 minutes after the attack began, all seven BolshevikStealth ships were on their way to the bottom, and with them wenttheir Bolshevik Commanders and mercenary crews collected fromaround the world.   The South Pacific action took place just after sunset localtime.  The time here in Washington was around 2:00 P.M. April 23. That evening Secretary of State Haig was seen briefly in publicwith the new British Foreign Minister, Francis Pym.  Pym waswearing the artificial pseudo-smile which diplomats are taughtalways to display in public.  But not Haig.  Haig was grinningfrom ear to ear, and no wonder.  The joint Rockefeller-Russianmilitary operation had been a brilliant success.  The secretBolshevik South Atlantic fleet had been virtually wiped out,bottled up inside South Georgia Island; and the South Pacificfleet, while not totally wiped out, had been badly crippled.  Byworking together, the Rockefeller cartel and the Russians had wonthe secret naval war of the Southern Hemisphere.Topic #3--As I say these words, news reports give the impressionthat war is about to erupt in the South Atlantic, but the realwar in the Southern Hemisphere is already over.  What we arewatching now is the beginning of its bloody aftermath.  Thataftermath is the battle for the Falkland Islands.  They have beenpromised to Argentina as a reward for her role in the secret war.   At this moment the Bolsheviks here in Washington are pressingfor a public announcement that the United States will side withBritain.  As soon as that takes place, military action will heatup fast around the Falklands.  Britain has no choice but tofight.  She has already suffered casualties which cannot beexplained without a public battle; but by fighting, theBolsheviks in Britain are running the risk of a humiliating andtragic defeat for the Royal Navy.   Meanwhile, the Rockefeller strategists here are nowconcentrating on a fast-building, anti-nuclear-war campaign.  Onall sides now we are hearing about the so-called ""nuclear freezemovement.""  There are documentaries, articles, publicity of allkinds to sensitize us to the terrors of nuclear war.  In recentmonths, there have even been referenda popping up on electionballots dealing with the nuclear war issue.  Medical doctors arebanding together to warn the public about what would happen ifthere were a nuclear war.   We are being told that all this is just popping upspontaneously.  We are now 37 years into the nuclear age andnothing like this has ever gained so much momentum before, yetnow we are supposed to believe that millions of Americans havespontaneously gotten the same ideas at the same time.  If youbelieve that, my friends, I give up.  Movements like this never,and I mean never, develop without leadership, organization, andmoney--and plenty of it.   What we are watching is the Rockefeller public relationsmachine at work.  As I've explained in the past, the Rockefellercartel cannot afford to let a nuclear war take place.  If itdoes, they will lose everything because they are not in aposition to control it.  Instead, the deadly enemies of theRockefeller cartel, the Bolsheviks here, will win out if there isa war; and so the Rockefeller faction is now doing everything inits power to prevent a nuclear war.   The present anti-nuclear-war orientation of the Rockefellercartel creates certain temporary common interests between themand Russia; but as Russia's new rulers know very well, this doesnot spring from any great moral perspective on the part of theRockefeller group.  It's purely a matter of practical necessityright now for the Rockefellers.   The Russians regard the United States as a house divided, andthey are exploiting that division by working in careful ways withthe Rockefellers.  Their first priority is to rid the world ofthe deadly Bolshevik menace of all-out, even suicidal, nuclearwar; but once that is done, they know that there will be a day ofreckoning with the Rockefeller cartel some day.   The Rockefeller group is working toward a definite objectivewith their new anti-nuclear-war propaganda.  That objective isrenewed power--and power that moves them closer to their olddream of WORLD GOVERNMENT.  The Bolsheviks here have unwittinglyprovided fertile ground for the powerful new Rockefeller antiwarcampaign.  Under Bolshevik control, the so-called ReaganAdministration has become so hawkish that it's scaring people. The Rockefeller antiwar campaign is designed to capitalize onthat latent fear as a tool of power.   These days the smell of war is in the air.  The Falklandscrisis is helping to make that more intense.  The Rockefellerpropaganda machine is now paving the way for the argument thatsurrender of sovereignty is the only way to avoid war.  A newsuper-United Nations of sorts is now in the works to fill thebill.  It will have teeth!  As presently envisioned, the neworganization will be based in Geneva, Switzerland.  The workingname, though this may be changed, is the ""World NonproliferationCouncil.""  The plan is to bring it into being as the outgrowth ofnuclear nonproliferation treaties, but its true purpose will beto use fear--the fear of war--to control us all.                       LAST MINUTE SUMMARY   Now it's time for my Last Minute Summary.  In this AUDIOLETTER I have reported on the reasons behind the so-calledFalkland Islands crisis.  The crisis erupted because of secretBolshevik-controlled naval installations in the SouthernHemisphere.  These have been attacked by joint action of theRockefeller cartel and the Russians in an attempt to slow downthe nuclear-war timetable.  The attacks were successful, but theresults remain to be seen.  One result, though, is that the RoyalNavy has now been drawn into a trap.  Britain's Waterloo at seamay well be at hand.   My friends, two factions are struggling for control over ourUnited States--the Rockefeller cartel and the Bolsheviks.  Theydiffer in style but both seek to control us through fear.  If weare ever to rise above their trickery, it must be through thepower of our Lord Jesus Christ, our only hope.  As the Scripturetells us, our Lord ""...has not given us the spirit of fear; butof power, of love, and of a sound mind.""  We must learn to wagepeace.  As our Lord declared long ago, ""Blessed are thepeacemakers: for they shall be called sons of God.""   Until next month, God willing, this is Dr. Beter.  Thank you,and may God bless each and every one of you."	talk.politics.misc

I have noproblems with multiple Gods.  To me, the whole context of the scripturessays:  Be perfect, even as your Father Who is in Heaven; that we can beco-heirs with Christ; that we will be like Him. Co-heirs share all things equally--including knowledge, power, dominion etc.When I am like Him (Christ), I will be the same as HE is--and He is a God. If God cannot do this, the His is not all powerful--and He is NOT God.If He will not, He is a Liar--and He is NOT God. But if He does, He is the greatest of all the Gods. [I don't know of anyone who says that Jesus prayed to himself.  Thewhole point of the Trinity is that there's enough of a distinctionwithin God that relationship is possible.  This implies some sort ofcommunication.  I assume that in their ""native"" form, the Father andSon are directly enough connected that prayer in our sense isn'tinvolved.  But Jesus is the incarnation of the Son, i.e.  the Logosmade flesh.  When he's in a human form, his human actions are limitedto human capabilities.  So communication with the Father takes theform of prayer.  I don't see that there's anything problematical aboutthat.  It seems to be implicit in the whole idea of incarnation.--clh]"	soc.religion.christian

"Newsgroup:soc.religion.christianDocument_id: 21385From: gideon@otago.ac.nz (Gideon King)Subject: Should Christians fight? / Justifiable warI posted this a couple of weeks ago, and it doesn't seem to have appeared  on the newsgroup, and I haven't had a reply from the moderator. We were  having intermittent problems with our mail at the time. Please excuse me  if you have seen this before...Should Christians fight?Last week Alastair posted some questions about fighting, and whether there  are such things as ""justifiable wars"". I have started looking into these  things and have jotted down my findings as I go. I haven't answered all  his questions yet, and I know what I have here is on a slightly different  tack, but possibly I'll be able to get into it more deeply later, and post  some more info soon.Our duty to our neighbour:Do good to all men (Gal 6:10)Love our neighbour as ourselves (Matt 22:39)Act the part of the good Samaritan (Luke 10) toward any who may be in  trouble. We will therefore render every possible assistance to an injured  man, and therefore should not be part of any organisation which causes  people harm (even medical corps of the army etc).Christians are by faith ""citizens of the commonwealth of Israel""  (Ephesians 2:11-12), and also recognise that ""God rules in the kingdoms of  men"", and therefore we should not be taking part in any of the struggles  of those nations which we are not part of due to our faith.We are to be ""strangers and pilgrims"" amongst the nations, so we are just  passing through, and not part of any nation or any national aspirations  (this can also be applied to politics etc, but that's another story). We  are not supposed to ""strive"" or ""resist evil"" (even ""suffer yourselves to  be defrauded"") it is therefore incosistent for us to strive to assist in  preserving a state which Christ will destroy when he returns to set up  God's kingdom.Our duty to the state.""Render therefore unto Caesar the things which be Caesar's and unto God  the things which be God's"" (Luke 20:25).""Let every soul be subject unto the higher powers. For there is no power  but of God; the powers that be are ordained of God. Whosoever resisteth  the power, resisteth the ordinance of God"" (Rom 13:1-2).""Submit yourselves to every ordinance of man for the Lord's sake; whether  it be to king as supreme... for so is the will of God that with well doing  ye may put to silence the ignorance of foolish men"" (1 Pet 2:13-15)These scriptures make it clear that submission to the powers that be is a  divine command, but it is equally clear from Acts 5:19-29 that when any  ordinance of man runs counter to God's law, we must refuse submission to  it. The reason for this is that we are God's ""bond servants"" and His  service is our life's task. An example of the type of thing is in Col  3:22-23 where bondservants were to ""work heartily as unto the Lord"" - so  also we should work as if our boss was God - i.e. ""Pressed down, shaken  together, and running over""... oops - a bit of a side track there...In the contests between the nations, we are on God's side - a side that is  not fighting in the battle, but is ""testifying"" to the truth.When we believe in God and embrace His promises, we become ""fellow  citizens with the Saints and of the Household of God"", and are no longer  interested in associations of the world. Think of this in relation to  unions etc as well. Paul tells us to ""lay aside every weight"" that we may  run ""the race that is set before us"", and if we are wise, we will discard  any association which would retard our progress - ""Thou therefore endure  hardness as a good soldier of Jesus Christ. No man that warreth entangleth  himself with the affairs of this life, that he may please him who hath  chosen him to be a soldier"" (2 Tim 2:3-4).One of these entanglements he warns about is ""be ye not unequally yoked  together with unbelievers"". One of the obvious applications of this is  marriage with unbelievers, but it also covers things like business  partnerships and any other position where we may form a close association  with any person or persons not believing the truth about God (in this case  the army). The principle comes from Deut 22:10 - remember that as well as  them being different animals of different strengths, one was clean and one  unclean under the law. These ideas are strongly stressed in 2 Cor 6:13-18  - I suggest you read this. The yoking also has another aspect - that of  servitude, and Jesus says ""take my yoke upon you"", so we are then yoked  with Christ and cannot be yoked with unbelievers. We have already seen  that we are bondservants of Christ, and Paul says ""become not ye the  bondservants of men (1 Cor 7:23 RV).An example from the Old Testament: the question is asked in 2 Chr 19:2  ""Shouldest thou help the ungodly...?"". The situation here is a good  example of what happens when you are yoked together with unbelievers.  Jehoshaphat was lucky to escape with his life. Here are the facts:1. He had made an affinity with Ahab, who had ""sold himself to work  wickedness before the Lord"" (1 Kings 21:25).2. When asked by Ahab to form a military alliance, he had agreed and said  ""I am as thou art, my people as thy people"" (1 Kings 22:4) - an unequal  yoking.3. He sttod firm in refusing the advice of the false prophets and insisted  on hearing the prophet of the Lord (trying to do the right thing), he  found that he was yoked and therefore couldn't break away from the evil  association he had made.God says to us ""Come out from among them and be ye separate, and touch not  the unclean thing, and I will receive you and ye shall be my sons and  daughters"" (2 Cor 6:17).This is more or less what I have found out so far - I'm still looking into  it, as I don't think I've answered all the questions raised by Alastair  yet. Heres a summary and a few things to think about:The Christian in under command. Obedience to this command is an essential  factor in his relationship with Christ (John 15:10,14).Total dedication to this course of action is required (Romans 12:1-2).Disobedience compromises the close relationship between Christ and his  followers (1 Pet 2:7-8).We are to be separated to God (Rom 6:4). This involves a master-servant  relationship (Rom 6:12,16).No man can serve two masters (Matt 6:24,13,14).All that is in the 'Kosmos' is lust and pride - quite opposed to Gos (1  John 2:16). Christs kingdom is not of this world (i.e. not worldly in  nature) - if it was, his servants would fight to deliver him. If Christ is  our master and he was not delivered by his servants because his kingdom  was not of this world, then his servants cannot possibly fight for another  master.Strangers and pilgrims have no rights, and we cannot swear allegiance to  anyone but God.The servant of the Lord must not war but be gentle to all (2 Tim 2:24) -  this does not just apply to war, but also to avoiding strife throughout  our lives. There is a war to be waged, not with man's weapons (2 Cor  10:3-4), but with God's armour (Eph6:13-20).I'll probably post some more when I've had time to look into things a bit  further.--Gideon King                         | Phone +64-3-479 8347University of Otago                 | Fax   +64-3-479 8529Department of Computer Science      | e-mail gideon@farli.otago.ac.nzP.O.

I believethat X is grabbing the first font on the path with these characteristicsand displaying it.  Since I have only 75dpi and 100dpi fonts on mypath, the results are inaccurate.  I do have some Speedo fonts, butnot for the family I am using (Helvetica).I think this is incorrect.  The fonts should always be provided in theresolution of the display.  This never seems to happen unless youexplicitly request fonts by xres and yres!  This is true of both thescaleable and bitmapped fonts!  For instance, the commandxfd -fn '-bitstream-charter-*-*-*-*-*-240-*-*-*-*-*-*'Will invoke a 75dpi font (despite the fact that this is a Speedo font).The command  xfd -fn '-adobe-courier-*-*-*-*-*-240-*-*-*-*-*-*'Will invoke a 75dpi font or a 100dpi font (depending on my font path).Despite the fact that X knows my display is 85 dpi, and that it cangenerate an 85dpi font for me!  Unless I my applications specifies aresolution, X appears to pick a stupid default.Is this a bug?  Is it a feature?  If so, why?  Is there anything I cando to get around this problem?  People have suggested that I lie aboutmy resolution, and specify a single font path (75 or 100, not both).This would at least make my app consistent, but I like being able tolook at rulers that appear in my paint application and say: ""Yup, thatsan inch"".

The computer will actually ""sense"" how you drive your car and  as time goes by the green indicators will start to go off one by one and  then the yellow indicator will turn on and then the red indicator will go  on. And you should get service when by the time green indicators are off.    After service the mechanic(or you) will reset the service indicators and the  computer starts counting again.So I expect to have a tool(or a procedure) to reset it so the green lights will come on and the yellow and red lights will go off.I wonder how people can do oil change themself without knowing how to reset theindicator.It's the first european car I have and changing oil at 15,000 miles is a surprise to me. and it's a big plus :-). But I wonder how that could happensince the oil lose its lubrication ability over time, I thought it's the oil andnot the vehicle that determines how often we should change oil.Any BMW owner on the net?

"Newsgroup:talk.politics.gunsDocument_id: 54117From: cathy@LANCE.ColoState.Edu (Cathy Smith)Subject: Letter to a Liberal Colleague -- L. Neil SmithPosted by Cathy Smith for L. Neil Smith                   LETTER TO A LIBERAL COLLEAGUE[AUTHOR'S NOTE:  ""Adrian"" -- name changed to protect the guilty -- and the author are science fiction novelists who once worked with the same editor at a famous New York publishing house.]Dear Adrian:  I'm way behind schedule on my current book again, so this reply to your note -- criticizing the recent magazine interview I gave and generally attacking gun ownership -- will necessarily consist mostly of assertions you're free to believe (or not) I can back with evidence and logic I've neither time nor energy to present now.  I've written fully on this topic before and will again in the future.  When I do, I'll make sure you get copies.  There are many arguments I might make, from the futility and danger of delegating self-defense to the police (see Don Kates in the Jan. 10, 1985 WALL STREET JOURNAL) to the real effect of prohibition, shifting consumers from newly-outlawed handguns or semiautomatic rifles to items like sawed-off shotguns or homemade bombs, but I'll limit myself here to commenting on the newspaper clipping you sent with your note.  First, the freedom to own and carry the weapon of your choice is a natural, fundamental, and inalienable human, individual, civil, and Constitutional right -- subject neither to the democratic process nor to arguments grounded in social utility.  Second, publication of some latter-day ""scientific study"" doesn't alter the fact that the gun prohibitionists I discussed in my interview -- annoying you so much in the process -- were lying.  Third, the freedom to own and carry the weapon of your choice is a natural, fundamental, and inalienable human, individual, civil, and Constitutional right -- subject neither to the democratic process nor to arguments grounded in social utility.  Fourth, as often happens with these things, the ""study"" doesn't support the gun prohibitionists' original numerical contentions anyway, but simply adds a new layer of spurious claims to an older body of lies, omissions, and distortions.  Fifth, the freedom to own and carry the weapon of your choice is a natural, fundamental, and inalienable human, individual, civil, and Constitutional right -- subject neither to the democratic process nor to arguments grounded in social utility.  Sixth, the fact that gun prohibitionists have been caught lying on countless occasions (Carl Bakal, author of NO RIGHT TO KEEP AND BEAR ARMS, even confessed to it publicly) makes the value of this present ""study"" dubious, to say the least.  Seventh, the freedom to own and carry the weapon of your choice is a natural, fundamental, and inalienable human, individual, civil, and Constitutional right -- subject neither to the democratic process nor to arguments grounded in social utility.  Eighth, given your own lifelong service as a federal bureaucrat (not to mention the cynical sophistication of your fiction), you should be better aware than most people how ""progress"" -- in designing ""studies"" to prove whatever you want -- outstrips our ability to collect meaningful data.  A case in point we might agree on is the fact that it took another kind of prohibitionist 20 or 30 years to create ""studies"" ""proving"" that pornography causes crime.  More naive (and probably more honest) efforts in the 50s and 60s clearly indicate the contrary.  Ninth, the freedom to own and carry the weapon of your choice is a natural, fundamental, and inalienable human, individual, civil, and Constitutional right -- subject neither to the democratic process nor to arguments grounded in social utility.  Tenth, another reason to doubt all such ""studies"" is that human behavior (as the Austrian School of economics demonstrates) is fartoo complex and unpredictable to be meaningfully quantified.  The attempt to do so -- and then create public policy based on the resulting pseudo-information -- is wrecking our civilization.  Eleventh, the freedom to own and carry the weapon of your choice is a natural, fundamental, and inalienable human, individual, civil, and Constitutional right -- subject neither to the democratic process nor to arguments grounded in social utility.  Twelfth, the ""study"" is also worthless because it incorporates figures for suicide, which is not necessarily a tragedy but basically another individual right, sometimes with ancillary social benefits.  If anything, perhaps suicide INTERVENTION should be a criminal offense.  Thirteenth and finally, the National Rifle Association officials quoted in the article, whatever their shortcomings (and they are many), are correct in this instance:  the ""study"" is meaningless because the freedom to own and carry the weapon of your choice is a natural, fundamental, and inalienable human, individual, civil, and Constitutional right -- subject neither to the democratic process nor to arguments grounded in social utility.  And because of that, Adrian, even if the ""study"" were valid, it wouldn't deter me from a lifelong personal objective of seeing that anyone can own any weapon he or she prefers and carry it however, whenever, and wherever he or she desires without asking anybody's permission. In this I'm ably assisted by gun prohibitionists themselves, whose yawping invariably moves previously unarmed people to go out and buy their first gun ""while they still can"".  Before the '68 Gun Control Act, most of the ""shooting fraternity"" viewed handguns (incorrectly, as it turned out) as inaccurate, ineffective toys.  There probably weren't six million of them in the whole country.  Now, thanks to Kennedy, Metzenbaum, the Bradys, and their ilk -- AMERICA'S GREATEST SPORTING GOODS SALES TEAM -- we probably manufacture at least that many every year.The fascinating datum is that Handgun Control, et al. are perfectly aware of this -- so I guess you'll have to ask them yourself what their real motives are.  Look:  gun-making isn't an arcane or difficult art (and by the way, it's easier to make a fully automatic weapon than a semiautomatic; the fact that I can still obtain my own weapon of preference, the self-loading pistol, is the only thing which keeps me from pursuing this further).  Even if it were difficult, there are already a quarter billion firearms in America, with an estimated ""half life"" of 1000 years -- possibly more for stainless steel.  Guns are gonna be around a long time, Adrian, whether you like it or not.As for me, to paraphrase Elmer Keith, regardless of what the law provides or any court decides, I'm always going to be armed.  And I will always work to see that others are, as well.  The bad news is that there are thousands more -- perhaps even hundreds of thousands -- where I come from.  We can't be stopped by passing laws, we can only be forced to arm ourselves and others secretly and -- given both the practical and alleged differences between full automatics and semiautomatics -- perhaps more efficiently.  So what's the point?  L.

EDT                                       THE PRESIDENT:  Good morning.  My voice is coming toyou this morning through the facilities of the oldest radiostation in America, KDKA in Pittsburgh.  I'm visiting the city tomeet personally with citizens here to discuss my plans for jobs,health care and the economy.  But I wanted first to do my weeklybroadcast with the American people.                           I'm told this station first broadcast in 1920 whenit reported that year's presidential elections.  Over the pastseven decades presidents have found ways to keep in touch withthe people, from whistle-stop tours to fire-side chats to the bustour that I adopted, along with Vice President Gore, in lastyear's campaign.                          Every Saturday morning I take this time to talk withyou, my fellow Americans, about the problems on your minds andwhat I'm doing to try and solve them.  It's my way of reportingto you and of giving you a way to hold me accountable.                          You sent me to Washington to get our government andeconomy moving after years of paralysis and policy and a badexperiment with trickle-down economics.  You know how importantit is for us to make bold, comprehensive changes in the way we dobusiness.                            We live in a competitive global economy.  Nationsrise and fall on the skills of their workers, the competitivenessof their companies, the imagination of their industries, and thecooperative experience and spirit that exists between business,labor and government.  Although many of the economies of theindustrialized world are now suffering from slow growth, they'vemade many of the smart investments and the tough choices whichour government has for too long ignored.  That's why many of themhave been moving ahead and too many of our people have beenfalling behind.                          We have an economy today that even when it grows isnot producing new jobs.  We've increased the debt of our nationby four times over the last 12 years, and we don't have much toshow for it.  We know that wages of most working people havestopped rising, that most people are working longer work weeksand that too many families can no longer afford the escalatingcost of health care.                          But we also know that, given the right tools, theright incentives and the right encouragement, our workers andbusinesses can make the kinds of products and profits our economyneeds to expand opportunity and to make our communities betterplaces to live.                          In many critical products today Americans are thelow cost, high quality producers.  Our task is to make sure thatwe create more of those kinds of jobs.                          Just two months ago I gave Congress my plan forlong-term jobs and economic growth.  It changes the oldpriorities in Washington and puts our emphasis where it needs tobe -- on people's real needs, on increasing investments and jobsand education, on cutting the federal deficit, on stopping thewaste which pays no dividends, and redirecting our preciousresources toward investment that creates jobs now and lays thegroundwork for robust economic growth in the future.                          These new directions passed the Congress in recordtime and created a new sense of hope and opportunity in ourcountry.  Then the jobs plan I presented to Congress, which wouldcreate hundreds of thousands of jobs, most of them in the privatesector in 1993 and 1994, passed the House of Representatives.  Itnow has the support of a majority of the United States Senate. But it's been held up by a filibuster of a minority in theSenate, just 43 senators.  They blocked a vote that they knowwould result in the passage of our bill and the creation of jobs.                          The issue isn't politics; the issue is people. Millions of Americans are waiting for this legislation andcounting on it, counting on us in Washington.  But the jobs billhas been grounded by gridlock.                            I know the American people are tired of business asusual and politics as usual.  I know they don't want us to spinor wheels.  They want the recovery to get moving.  So I havetaken a first step to break this gridlock and gone the extramile.  Yesterday I offered to cut the size of this plan by 25percent -- from $16 billion to $12 billion.                            It's not what I'd hoped for.  With 16 millionAmericans looking for full-time work, I simply can't let the billlanguish when I know that even a compromise bill will meanhundreds of thousands of jobs for our people.  The mandate is toact to achieve change and move the country forward.  By takingthis initiative in the face of an unrelenting Senate talkathon, Ithink we can respond to your mandate and achieve a significantportion of our original goals.                          First, we want to keep the programs as much aspossible that are needed to generate jobs and meet human needs,including highway and road construction, summer jobs for youngpeople, immunization for children, construction of waste watersites, and aid to small businesses.  We also want to keep fundingfor extended unemployment compensation benefits, for people whohave been unemployed for a long time because the economy isn'tcreating jobs.                          Second, I've recommended that all the other programsin the bill be cut across-the-board by a little more than 40percent.                          And third, I've recommended a new element in thisprogram to help us immediately start our attempt to fight againstcrime by providing $200 million for cities and towns to rehirepolice officers who lost their jobs during the recession and putthem back to work protecting our people.  I'm also going to fightfor a tough crime bill because the people of this country need itand deserve it.                          Now, the people who are filibustering this bill --the Republican senators -- say they won't vote for it because itincreases deficit spending, because there's extra spending thisyear that hasn't already been approved.  That sounds reasonable,doesn't it?  Here's what they don't say.  This program is morethan paid for by budget cuts over my five-year budget, and thisbudget is well within the spending limits already approved by theCongress this year.                          It's amazing to me that many of these same senatorswho are filibustering the bill voted during the previousadministration for billions of dollars of the same kind ofemergency spending, and much of it was not designed to put theAmerican people to work.                            This is not about deficit spending.  We have offereda plan to cut the deficit.  This is about where your prioritiesare -- on people or on politics.                            Keep in mind that our jobs bill is paid for dollarfor dollar.  It is paid for by budget cuts.  And it's thesoundest investment we can now make for ourselves and ourchildren.  I urge all Americans to take another look at this jobsand investment program; to consider again the benefits for all ofus when we've helped make more American partners working toensure the future of our nation and the strength of our economy.                          You know, if every American who wanted a job hadone, we wouldn't have a lot of the other problems we have in thiscountry today.  This bill is not a miracle, it's a modest firststep to try to set off a job creation explosion in this countryagain.  But it's a step we ought to take.  And it is fully paidfor over the life of our budget.                          Tell your lawmakers what you think.  Tell them howimportant the bill is.  If it passes, we'll all be winners.                          Good morning, and thank you for listening.                               END                 10:11 A.M. EDT	talk.politics.misc

I am running Win 3.1 with NDW 2.2 on a 486sx with 8 meg of memory and a    6 meg perm swap file and am getting exceedingly frustrated that my    applications are not giving back system resources when I close them.    When I load windows I start with about 83% resources available but many    of the application programs I run regularly (WPWIN 5.2, VB 2.0, WINQVT    2.8, Lotus Organizer, etc.) seem to not return all their resources when    I exit them.  After a day or two of work I often find myself down under    50% of available resources even when I have no applications other than    my shell running.    I am aware this is a known problem; what I am looking for are some    suggestions of what I might do to mitigate it.      1. What software is the culprit?  Win 3.1, NDW, my applications?  Are    some modes of Win 3.1 (standard, real, enhanced) better than others at    plugging this leak?    2. Are their system.ini switches i can set to help plug this leak?    3. Do people know of patches or third party software that help with    this?  Seems like increasing or better managing system resources is a    great market for a third party memory company like QEMM.    4. If I run Progman instead of NDW will the leak subside?  (I was    hoping that NDW 2.2 would have plugged this, but it seems no different    than 2.0 in how it deals with memory and resources.)    5. When I am writing VB code are there things I can do to make it less    likely my code will eat resources?    6. Any other suggestions that I don't know enough to ask for    specifically?

These are books intended for use in undergraduate Bible   courses.  They give historical background, discussion of literary   styles, etc.  And generally they have good bibligraphies for further   reading.  I typically recommend Kee, Froehlich and Young's NT   introduction...Two other Intros to consider:The ""Introduction"" by Ku:mmel is a translation of a strandard NT text.The references are slightly dated and the style is somewhat dense, butthe book contains a wealth of information.Perrin and Duling's Intro is also very good.  It's somewhat moremodern than Ku:mmel's but not quite so densely packed.  Also theauthors tend to go through the books of the NT in the historical orderof composition; this gives a very useful perspective on thedevelopment of the NT.   ... There are also some good one-volume commentaries.  ... Probably the   best recommendation these days would be Harper's Bible Commentary.A slight dissent: I think the Harper's is ""OK"" but not great.  Oneparticular problem I have is that it tends to be pretty skimpy onbibliographic material.  My feeling is that it is OK for quicklook-ups, but not real useful for study in depth (e.g. I keep a copyin my office at work).   ...

Alsothere's a separate Harper's Bible Dictionary (most of my comments onthe HC also apply to the HBD.)My favorite one-volume commentary is the ""New Jerome BiblicalCommentary"".  The NJBC is rather Catholic in focus and somewhat biasedtowards the NT.  (The reader can decide for her- or himself whetherthese are pluses or minuses.)

If you are reading a copy of this FAQ which is more than a few  months old (see the ""Last-modified"" date above) you should probably  locate the latest edition, since the information may be outdated.

Lewis (faq%craft@uunet.uu.net) maintains the informative and  well written ""comp.windows.x Frequently Asked Questions"" document.  Its focus is on general X information, while this FAQ concentrates  on performance.  The comp.windows.x FAQ does address the issue of speed, but only with  regards to the X server.  The gist of that topic seems to be:	""Use X11R5, it is faster than R4"".  (Please see the X FAQ for complete details).---------------Window Managers---------------  There are a lot of window managers out there, with lots of different  features and abilities.  The choice of which to use is by necessity a  balancing act between performance and useful features.  At this  point, most respondents have agreed upon ""twm"" as the best candidate  for a speedy window manager.   A couple of generic tricks you can try to soup up your window manger,  is turning off unnecessary things like ""zooming"" and ""opaque move"".  Also, if you lay out your windows in a tiled manner, you reduce the  amount of cpu power spent in raising and lowering overlapping  windows.                           Joe English (joe@trystero.art.com)  I've found that a good font for tiling is 7x13 (aka:  -misc-fixed-medium-r-normal--13-100-100-100-c-70-iso8859-1 ). It is  the biggest font I know of that I can use on my Sun (1152x900 screen)  and still get two 80 column terminal windows side-by-side on the  display with no overlap.  Other font suggestions will be accepted.------------The X Server------------Which Server?- - - - - - -  Make sure that your server is a proper match for your hardware.  If you have a monochrome monitor, use a monochrome X11 server.  On my Monochrome Sun, I haven't noticed much difference between  the Xsun (colour) server and XsunMono, however it was pointed out to  me that XsunMono is about 800k smaller and therefore should contribute  to less paging.           [ thanks to: Jonny Farringdon (j.farringdon@psychol.ucl.ac.uk),                        Michael Salmon (Michael.Salmon@eos.ericsson.se) ]  How your server was compiled can also make a difference.  Jeff Law  (law@schirf.cs.utah.edu) advises us that on a Sun system, X should be  compiled with gcc (version 2.*) or with the unbundled Sun compiler.  You can expect to get ""*very* large speedups in the server"" by not  using the bundled SunOS compiler.  I assume that similar results  would occur if you used one of the other high-quality commercial  compilers on the market.Locking the Server into RAM?- - - - - - - - - - - - - - -  Has anyone tried hacking the X server so that it is locked into RAM and  does not get paged?  eg: via a call to plock().  Does this help  performance at all?  I've had one inquiry on this topic, and a few  pointers to the plock() function call, but no hard evidence from someone  who's tried it.  I am not in a position to give it a try.  			  [thanks to: Eric C Claeys (ecc@eperm.att.com),				      Danny Backx (db@sunbim.be),				      Juan D. Martin (juando@cnm.us.es) ]Starting your Server- - - - - - - - - - -  Joe English (joe@trystero.art.com) :    If you start up a lot of clients in your .xsession or whatever, sleep    for a second or two after launching each one.  After I changed my    .xclients script to do this, logging in actually took *less* time...    we have a heavily loaded system without much core, though.  This sounds crazy, but I have confirmed that it works!    Warner Losh (imp@Solbourne.COM) provided me with a good explanation of  why this works, which I have summarized here:    When you start up an X server it takes a huge amount of time to    start accepting connections.  A lot of initialization is done by    the server when it starts.  This process touches a large number of    pages.  Any other process running at the same time would fight the    server for use of the CPU, and more importantly, memory.  If you    put a sleep in there, you give the Server a chance to get itself    sorted out before the clients start up.    Similarly, there is also a lot of initialization whenever an X    client program starts: toolkits registering widgets, resources    being fetched, programs initializing state and ""databases"" and so    forth.  All this activity is typically memory intensive.  Once this    initialization is done (""The process has reached a steady state""),    the memory usage typically settles down to using only a few pages.    By using sleeps to stagger the launching of your clients in your    .Xinitrc , you avoid them fighting each other for your    workstation's limited resources  This is most definitely a ""Your Mileage May Vary"" situation, as there  are so many variables to be considered: available RAM, local swap  space, load average, number of users on your system, which clients  you are starting, etc.  Currently in my .xinitrc I have a situation like:	(sleep 1; exec xclock ) &	(sleep 1; exec xbiff ) &	(sleep 1; exec xterm ) &	(sleep 1; exec xterm ) &  I've experimented with:	(sleep 1; exec xclock ) &	(sleep 2; exec xbiff ) &	(sleep 3; exec xterm ) &	(sleep 4; exec xterm ) &  I've even tried:	(sleep 2; exec start_X_clients_script ) &  and then in start_X_clients_script I had:	(sleep 1; exec xclock ) &	(sleep 1; exec xbiff ) &	(sleep 1; exec xterm ) &	(sleep 1; exec xterm ) &    [ The idea with this last one was to make sure that xinit had    completely finished processing my .xinitrc, and had settled down    into a ""steady state"" before the sleep expired and all my clients    were launched. ]  All of these yielded fairly comparable results, and so I just stuck with  my current setup, for its simplicity.  You will probably have to  experiment a bit to find a setup which suits you.Fonts- - -  Loading fonts takes time and RAM.  If you minimize the number of fonts  your applications use, you'll get speed increases in load-up time.  One simple strategy is to choose a small number of fonts (one small, one  large, one roman, whatever suits you) and configure all your clients -- or  at least all your heavily used clients -- to use only those few fonts.  Client programs should start up quicker if their font is already loaded  into the server.  This will also conserve server resources, since fewer  fonts will be loaded by the server.			      [ Farrell McKay (fbm@ptcburp.ptcbu.oz.au),			        Joe English (joe@trystero.art.com) ]  eg: My main xterm font is 7x13, so I also have twm set up to use 7x13  in all it's menus and icons etc.  Twm's default font is 8x13.  Since  I don't normally use 8x13, I've eliminated one font from my server.  Oliver Jones (oj@roadrunner.pictel.com):    Keep fonts local to the workstation, rather than loading them over nfs.    If you will make extensive use of R5 scalable fonts, use a font server.About the Resources File- - - - - - - - - - - - -    Keep your .Xresources / .Xdefaults file small.  Saves RAM and saves    on server startup time.          Joe English (joe@trystero.art.com)  One suggestion:    In your .Xdefaults (.Xresources) file, try putting only the minimum    number of resources that you want to have available to all of your    applications.  For example:  *reverseVideo: true    Then, separate your resources into individual client-specific    resource files.  For example: $HOME/lib/app-defaults.  In your    .login file set the environment variable XUSERFILESEARCHPATH:	setenv XUSERFILESEARCHPATH $HOME/lib/app-defaults/%N    [ The ""comp.windows.x Frequently Asked Questions"" FAQ contains    an excellent explanation of how these environment variables work.    --ed.]    So, when xterm launches, it loads its resources from    .../app-defaults/XTerm.  Xdvi finds them in .../app-defaults/XDvi,    and so on and so forth.  Note that not all clients follow the same    XXxxx resource-file naming pattern.  You can check in your system    app-defaults directory (often: /usr/X11R5/lib/X11/app-defaults/) to    find the proper name, and then name your personal resource files    with the same name.    This is all documented in the Xt Specification (pg 125 & 666).		    [Thanks to: Kevin Samborn (samborn@mtkgc.com),		         Michael Urban (urban@cobra.jpl.nasa.gov),		             and Mike Long (mikel@ee.cornell.edu).	     Kevin is willing mail his setup files to inquirers.]  This method of organizing your personal resources has the following  benefits:    - Easier to maintain / more usable.    - Fewer resources are stored in the X server in the RESOURCE_MANAGER      property.  As a side benefit your server may start fractionally      quicker, since it doesn`t have to load all your resources.    - Applications only process their own resources, never have to sort       through all of your resources to find the ones that affect them.  It also has drawbacks:    - the application that you are interested in has to load an      additional file every time it starts up.  This doesn't seem to      make that much of a performance difference, and you might      consider this a huge boon to usability.  If you are modifying an      application's resource database, you just need to re-run the      application without having to ""xrdb"" again.    - xrdb will by default run your .Xdefaults file through cpp.  When      your resources are split out into multiple resource files and      then loaded by the individual client programs, they will not.      WATCH OUT FOR THIS!!      I had C style comments in my .Xdefaults file, which cpp stripped      out.  When I switched to this method of distributed resource      files I spent several frustrating days trying to figure out why      my clients were not finding their resources.  Xt did *NOT*      provide any error message when it encountered the C style      comments in the resource files, it simply, silently, aborted      processing the resource file.      The loss of preprocessing (which can be very handy, e.g. ``#ifdef      COLOR'' ...) is enough to cause some people to dismiss this      method of resource management.    - You may also run into some clients which break the rules.  For      example, neither Emacs (18.58.3) nor Xvt (1.0) will find their      resources if they are anywhere other than in .Xdefaults.    - when starting up a client on a machine that does not share files      with the machine where your resources are stored, your client      will not find its resources.  Loading all your resources into the      server will guarantee that all of your clients will always find      their resources.            Casey Leedom (casey@gauss.llnl.gov)  A possible compromise suggestion that I have (and am planning on trying)  is to put resources for all my heavily used clients (eg: xterm) into my  .Xdefaults file, and to use the ""separate resources files"" method for  clients that I seldom use.Define Your Display Properly- - - - - - - - - - - - - - -  Client programs are often executed on the same machine as the server.  In  that situation, rather than setting your DISPLAY environment variable to   ""<hostname>:0.0"", where <hostname> is the name of your workstation, you  should set your DISPLAY variable to ""unix:0.0"" or "":0.0"".  By doing this  you access optimized routines that know that the server is on the same  machine and use a shared memory method of transferring requests.			[thanks to Patrick J Horgan (pjh70@ras.amdahl.com)]  See the _DISPLAY NAMES_ section of the X(1) man page for further  explanation of how to properly set your display name.  ""I don't think it's stock MIT, but (at least) Data General and HP have  libraries that are smart enough to use local communication even when  the DISPLAY isn't set specially.""			      Rob Sartin (88opensi!sartin@uunet.UU.NET)  [Jody Goldberg (jody@algorithmics.com) sent me an Xlib patch to change  stock R5 to use local communication even if DISPLAY is not properly set.  I don't want to get in the business of distributing or trying to juggle  non-MIT patches and so have elected not to include it here.  Hopefully MIT  will apply this minor (~8 lines) patch themselves.  In the meantime, if  you want to try it yourself, email Jody.  --ed.]-------Clients-------  If you only have a few megabytes of Ram then you should think  carefully about the number of programs you are running.  Think also  about the _kind_ of programs you are running.  For example:  Is there  a smaller clock program than xclock?  Unfortunately, I haven't really noticed that programs advertise how large  they are, so the onus is on us to do the research and spread the word.  [ Suggestions on better alternatives to the some of the standard clients  (eg: Xclock, Xterm, Xbiff) are welcome.  --ed.]  I've received some contradictory advice from people, on the subject  of X client programs.  Some advocate the use of programs that are  strictly Xlib based, since Xt, Xaw and other toolkits are rather  large.  Others warn us that other applications which you are using  may have already loaded up one or more of these shared libraries.  In  this case, using a non-Xt (for example) client program may actually  _increase_ the amount of RAM consumed.  The upshot of all this seems to be: Don't mix toolkits.  That is, try  and use just Athena clients, or just Xview clients (or just Motif  clients, etc).  If you use more than one, then you're dragging in  more than one toolkit library.  Know your environment, and think carefully about which client  programs would work best together in that environment.

If you must use xterm, you can try reducing the number of saveLines  to reduce memory usage.  [ Oliver Jones (oj@roadrunner.pictel.com),		   Jonny Farringdon (j.farringdon@psychol.ucl.ac.uk) ]1) Xvt   suggested by: Richard Hesketh (rlh2@ukc.ac.uk) :   available: export.lcs.mit.edu in /contrib/xvt-1.0.tar.Z   ""...if you don't need all the esoteric features of xterm, then get   hold of xvt ...  it was written here just to save swap space as   xterm is rather a hog!

I've heard that   there are versions of xvt with this feature, but I've not found any   yet.   UPDATE (March 1993):  I recently had a few email conversations with   Brian Warkentin (brian.warkentine@eng.sun.com) regarding xvt.  He   questions whether xvt really is at all faster than xterm.  For   instance, xvt may initialize slightly faster, but compare scrolling   speed (try this quickie benchmark: /bin/time dd if=/etc/termcap   bs=40) and see which program can scroll faster.  Also, while xterm   may be slightly larger in RAM requirements (We don't have any hard   numbers here, does anyone else?) shared libraries and shared text   segments mean that xterm's paging requirements are not that major.   As an experiment, he ripped out all the tek stuff from xterm, but it   made little difference, since if you never use it, it never gets   brought into memory.   So here we stand with some conflicting reports on the validity of   xvt over xterm.  In summary?  Caveat Emptor, your mileage may vary.   If you can provide some hard data, I'd like to see it.

""I also have my own terminal emulator.  Its major lack is   scrollback, but some people like it anyway.""Tuning your client- - - - - - - - - -  Suggestions on how you can tune your client programs to work faster.  From Scott Barman (scott@asd.com) comes a suggestion regarding Motif  Text Field Widgets:    I noticed that during data entry into Motif text field widgets, I    was getting a slight lag in response to some keystrokes,    particularly the initial one in the field.  Examining the what was    going on with xscope I found it.  It seems that when the resource    XmNblinkRate is non-zero and the focus is on a text field widget    (or even just a text widget) the I-beam cursor will blink.    Every time the cursor appears or disappears in those widgets, the    widget code is making a request to the server (CopyArea).  The user    can stop this by setting the resource XmNblinkRate to 0.  It is not    noticeable on a 40MHz SPARC, but it does make a little difference    on a [slower system].  This specific suggestion can probably be applied in general to lots  of areas.  Consider your heavily used clients, are there any minor  embellishments that can be turned off and thereby save on Server  requests?-------------------------Miscellaneous Suggestions-------------------------Pretty Pictures- - - - - - - -  Don't use large bitmaps (GIF's, etc) as root window backgrounds.  - The more complicated your root window bitmap, the slower the server    is at redrawing your screen when you reposition windows (or redraw, etc)  - These take up RAM, and CPU power.  I work on a Sun SPARC and I'm    conscious of performance issues, I can't comprehend it when I see    people with a 4mb Sun 3/60 running xphoon as their root window.    I'll let someone else figure out how much RAM would be occupied by    having a full screen root image on a colour workstation.  - If you're anything like me, you need all the screen real estate    that you can get for clients, and so rarely see the root window anyway.		      [ Thanks to Qiang Alex Zhao (azhao@cs.arizona.edu) 			for reminding me of this one. --ed.]A Quicker Mouse- - - - - - - -  Using xset, you can adjust how fast your pointer moves on the screen  when you move your mouse.  I use ""xset m 3 10"" in my .xinitrc file,  which lets me send my pointer across the screen with just a flick of  the wrist.  See the xset man page for further ideas and information.  Hint: sometimes you may want to *slow down* your mouse tracking for  fine work.  To cover my options, I have placed a number of different  mouse setting commands into a menu in my window manager.    e.g. (for twm) :      menu ""mouse settings"" {        ""Mouse Settings:""			f.title	""  Very Fast""				! ""xset m 7 10 &""	""  Normal (Fast)""			! ""xset m 3 10 &""	""  System Default (Un-Accelerated)""	! ""xset m default &""	""  Glacial""				! ""xset m 0 10 &""      }Programming Thoughts- - - - - - - - - - -  Joe English (joe@trystero.art.com) :    To speed up applications that you're developing, there are tons of    things you can do.  Some that stick out:    - For Motif programs, don't set XmFontList resources for individual      buttons, labels, lists, et. al.; use the defaultFontList or      labelFontList or whatever resource of the highest-level manager      widget.  Again, stick to as few fonts as possible.    - Better yet, don't use Motif at all.  It's an absolute pig.    - Don't create and destroy widgets on the fly.  Try to reuse them.      (This will avoid many problems with buggy toolkits, too.)    - Use a line width of 0 in GCs.  On some servers this makes a HUGE      difference.    - Compress and collapse multiple Expose events.  This can make the      difference between a fast application and a completely unusable      one.  Francois Staes (frans@kiwi.uia.ac.be) :    Just a small remark: I once heard that using a better malloc    function would greatly increase performance of Xt based    applications since they use malloc heavily. They suggested trying    out the GNUY malloc, but I didn't find the time yet. I did some    tests on small programs just doing malloc and free, and the    differences were indeed very noticeable ( somewhat 5 times faster)  [ Any confirmation on this from anyone?  --ed.]  Andre' Beck (Andre_Beck@IRS.Inf.TU-Dresden.de) :  - Unnecessary NoExpose Events.    Most people use XCopyArea/XCopyPlane as fastest blit routines, but    they forget to reset graphics_exposures in the GC used for the    blits. This will cause a NoExpose Event every blit, that, in most    cases, only puts load onto the connection and forces the client to    run through it's event-loop again and again.  - Thousands of XChangeGC requests.    This ""Gfx Context Switching"" is also seen in most handcoded X-Apps,    where only one or few GCs are created and then heavily changed    again and again.  Xt uses a definitely better mechanism, by caching    and sharing a lot of GCs with all needed parameters. This will    remove the load of subsequent XChangeGC requests from the    connection (by moving it toward the client startup phase).Say What!?- - - - - -   Some contributors proposed ideas that seem right off the wall at first:  David B. Lewis (by day: dbl@osf.org, by night: david%craft@uunet.uu.net) :    How about this: swap displays with someone else. Run all your programs    on the other machine and display locally; the other user runs off your    machine onto the other display. Goal: reduce context switches in the    same operation between client and server.  I'm not in a situation where I can easily try this, but I have received  the following confirmation...  Michael Salmon (Michael.Salmon@eos.ericsson.se):    I regularly run programs on other machines and I notice a big    difference. I try to run on a machine where I will reduce net usage    and usually with nice to reduce the impact of my intrusion. This    helps a lot on my poor little SS1+ with only 16 MB, it was    essential when I only had 8 MB.  Casey Leedom (casey@gauss.llnl.gov) :    [The X11 Server and the client are] competing for the same CPU as    your server when you run it on the same machine.  Not really a    major problem, except that the X11 client and the server are in    absolute synchronicity and are context thrashing.  Timothy H Panton (thp@westhawk.uucp) :    Firstly it relies on the fact that most CPU's are mostly idle, X's    cpu usage is bursty.  so the chances of you and your teammate    doing something cpu-intensive at the same time is small. If they    are not then you get twice the cpu+memory available for your    action.    The second factor is that context switches are expensive, using 2    cpu's halves them, you pay a price due to the overhead of going    over the network, but this is offset in most cases by the improved    buffering of a network (typically 20k vs 4k for a pipe), allowing    even fewer context switches.----------------------------Other Sources of Information----------------------------  Volume 8 in O'Reilly's X Window System Series, ``X Window System  Administrator's Guide'' is a book all X administrator's should read.

The former is used on passports|> etc, and the later for daily identification in Israeli society. I|> am told that people in Israel have to carry their ID cards at all|> times and present them at many public places, almost every day.|> These ID cards make clear who the holder is, a Jew or an Arab.|> You maintain that this mainly because of religious services|> provided. But do you really believe that this is the reason ?|> Could you provide evidence that this is the case and that it|> serves no other purpose ?A number of points.  You are making assumptions about the mannerin which the cards are used.  True, by law, all residents, citizens,and tourists must carry a form of identification with them.  Forcitizens, the standard ID is the ID card.  The purpose this serveson a daily basis, wherein they are presented at public places,is for the purpose of identifying the bearer.  This takes placein banks (cashing checks), post offices (registered mail and such), etc...Quite frankly, it was rare that I ever had to present my ID cardfor such activities more than once per week.  There is no law orrequirement that forces people to wave their ID cards in public.Furthermore, none of the services I outlined discriminate againstthe bearer in any manner by having access to this information.The only case that I can think of in which the Le'um field mightbe taken into account is during interaction with the police,based upon the scenario.  In general though, arab citizens areclearly recognizable, as are non-arabs. Your argument thereforebecomes moot unless you can provide an example of how this fieldis being used to discriminate against them officially.|> In the answer to my second questions, concerning the fact that|> Israel has no fixed borders, you state that Israel's borders were|> 'shaped and reshaped by both war and peace'. According to what I|> read, the first Zionists in the beginning of the Century, had|> plans for the Jewish State to extend into what is Lebanon and into|> Transjordan (Jordan). I also read that it was the express wish of|> Ben-Gurion to not declare Israel's borders, when Israel was|> established, as this might restrict Israel's opportunities for|> later expansion. Israel often claims it right of existence on the|> fact that Jews lived there 2000 years ago or that God promised the|> land to them. But according to biblical sources, the area God|> promised would extend all the way to Iraq. And what were the|> borders in biblical times which Israel considers proper to use|> today ?  Finally, if Israel wants peace, why can't it declare what|> it considers its legitimate and secure borders, which might be a|> base for negotiations? Having all the above facts in mind, one|> cannot blame Arab countries to fear Israeli expansionism, as a|> number of wars have proved (1948, 1956, 1967, 1982).I take issue with your assertions.  I think that Arab countriesdo know that they have nothing to fear from ""Israeli expansionism"".Militarily, Israel is not capable of holding onto large tracts ofland under occupation to a hostile, armed, and insurgent population for asustained period of time.  As is, the intifada is heavily taxingthe Israeli economy.  Proof of this can be seen in the Israeliwithdrawal from Lebanon.  Israeli troops pulled back from theAwali, and later from the Litani, in order to control the minimalstrip needed to keep towns out of range of Katyusha missile fire.Public opinion in Israel has turned towards settling the intifadavia territorial concessions.  The Israel public is sufferring frombattle fatigue of sorts and the gov't is aware of it.With regards to borders, let me state the following.  I may not agreewith the manner in which negotiations are being held, however the cruxof the matter is that everyone either makes or refrains from statinga starting position.  The arab parties have called for total withdrawaland a return to pre-48 borders.  If Israel were to state large borders,the negotiations might never get under way.  If Israel were to statesmaller borders, then the arab countries might try and force even smallerborders during the negotiations.  I think that leaving the matter to besettled by negotiations and peace treaties is infinitely more realisticand sensible.|> Your answer to my third question is typical of a Stalinist public|> official. I don't think your answer is honest.  You refer me to|> Vanunu's revelations about Israel's nuclear arsenal without|> evaluating the truthfullness of his revelations.

You may take issuewith a number of things but clearly you have no understanding of theconcept of ""Secrets of state"", something which every democratic govthas.|> Somebody provided an answer to the fourth question, concerning|> 'hidden prisoners' in Israeli prisons. He posted an article from|> Ma'ariv documenting such cases.  It seems that such prisoners do|> exist in Israel. What do you think about that ?I noticed that he was documenting the fact that such prisoners could existmore than he documented the fact that they do exist.  The CLU noted,which you evidently did not pay attention to, that they know of no suchreports or cases.  I am sorry to tell you but in a country of 4 mill,as tightly knit as Israel, even if the matter of the arrest was notmade public, within a relatively short time frame, most people would knowabout it.  My own feelings are that the matter of the arrest should bemade public unless a court order is issued allowing a delay of X hours.This would be granted only if a judge could be convinced that anannouncement would cause irreparable harm to the ongoing investigation.|> You imply that my questions show bias and are formulated in such a|> way to 'cast aspersions upon Israel'.

Noring has pointed outthe catch-22 that if the ""crazy"" theory were true, you probably couldn'tfind any direct evidence of it --- that you couldn't observe those yeastiebeasties with present methods even if they were there.  Noring and thefellow from Oklahoma (sorry, forgot your name) have also suggested one setof anecdotal evidence in favor based on their personal experiences ---namely, that when people with certain conditions are given anti-fungals,many of them appear to get better.  So, if you have any evidence *against* the hypothesis --- for example,controlled double-blind studies showing that the anti-fungals don't do anybetter than sugar water --- then let's hear it.  If you don't, then what wehave is anecdotal and uncontrolled evidence on one side, and abjectdisbelief on the other.  In which case, please, there is no point in yellingback and forth at each other any longer since neither side has anyconvincing evidence either positive or negative.  And I understand that your abject disbelief is based on the existence ofpeople who may get famous or make money applying the diagnosis to everythingin sight, making wild claims with no evidence, and always refusing to docontrolled studies.  But that has absolutely no bearing on the apparentlysincere experiences of the people on the net observing anti-fungals workingon themselves and other people in certain specific cases.  There are alsoquacks who sell oral superoxide dismutase, in spite of the fact that it'scompletely broken down in the guts, but this doesn't change the genuinescientific knowledge about the role of superoxide dismutase in fightingoxidative damage.  Same thing.  Just cause there are candida quacks, thatdoesn't establish evidence against the candida hypothesis.  If there's someother reason (besides the quacks), if only anecdotal, to think it could betrue, then that is what has to be considered, that is what the net peoplehave been talking about.But again, there is no point in arguing about it.  There is anecdotalevidence, and there is no convincing evidence, and there are also somecandida quacks out there, I hope everyone can agree on all of that.  Thus,it appears to me the main question now is whether the proponents canmarshall enough anecdotal evidence in a convincing and documented enoughmanner to make a good case for carrying out a good controlled double-blindstudy of antifungals (or else, forget convincing anybody else to carry outthe test, just carry it out themselves!) --- and also, whether they canadequately define the patient population or symptoms on which such a studyshould be carried out to provide a fair test of the hypothesis.Ken--"	sci.med

Mr. Newman had seen the show in a rebroadcastthe next morning.  Mr. Schiff claimed that the offer only extended topeople who actually say the original broadcast, and so there was no offerfor Mr. Newman to accept, and so no unilateral contract was formed, andso Mr. Schiff did not have to pay $100,000.Mr. Schiff was correct, and so won.

(Acting Commander of Erzurum and Deveboynu regions and Commander        of the Second Erzurum Artillery Regiment Prisoner of War,        Lieutenant Colonel Toverdodleyov)""The things I have heard and seen during the two months, until the liberation of Erzurum by the Turks, have surpassed all the allegations concerning the vicious, degenerate characteristic of the Armenians. During the Russian occupation of Erzurum, no Armenian was permitted to approach the city and its environs. While the Commander of the First Army Corps, General Kaltiyin remained in power, troops including Armenian enlisted men, were not sent to the area. When the security measures were lifted, the Armenians began to  attack Erzurum and its surroundings. Following the attacks came the plundering of the houses in the city and the villages and the murder of the owners of these houses...Plundering was widely committed by the soldiers. This plunder was mainly committed by Armenian soldiers who had remained in the rear during the war. One day, while passing through the streets on horseback, a group of soldiers including an Armenian soldier began to drag two old men of seventy years in a certain direction. The roads were covered with mud, and these people were dragging the two helpless Turks through the mud and dirt... It was understood later that all these were nothing but tricks and traps. The Turks who joined the gendarmarie soon changed their minds and withdrew. The reason was that most of the Turks who were on night patrol did not return, and no one knew what had happened to them. The  Turks who had been sent outside the city for labour began to disappear also. Finally, the Court Martial which had been established for the trials of murderers and plunderers, began to liquidate itself for fear that they themselves would be punished. The incidents of murder and rape, which had decreased, began to occur more frequently. Sometime in January and February, a leading Turkish citizen Haci Bekir Efendi from Erzurum, was killed one night at his home. The Commander in Chief (Odiselidge) gave orders to find murderers within three days. The Commander in Chief has bitterly reminded the Armenian intellectuals that disobedience among the Armenian enlisted men had reached its highest point, that they had insulted and robbed the people and half of the Turks sent outside the city had not returned. ...We learnt the details this incident from the Commander-in-Chief, Odishelidge. They were as follows: The killings were organized by the doctors and the employers, and the act of killing was committed solely by the Armenian renegades... More than eight hundred unarmed and defenceless Turks have been killed in Erzincan. Large holes were dug and the defenceless  Turks were slaughtered like animals next to the holes. Later, the murdered Turks were thrown into the holes. The Armenian who stood  near the hole would say when the hole was filled with the corpses: 'Seventy dead bodies, well, this hole can take ten more.' Thus ten more Turks would be cut into pieces, thrown into the hole, and when the hole was full it would be covered over with soil. The Armenians responsible for the act of murdering would frequently fill a house with eighty Turks, and cut their heads off one by one. Following the Erzincan massacre, the Armenians began to withdraw towards Erzurum... The Armenian renegades among those who withdrew to Erzurum from Erzincan raided the Moslem villages on the road, and destroyed the entire population, together with the villages. During the transportation of the cannons, ammunition and the carriages that were outside the war area, certain people were hired among the  Kurdish population to conduct the horse carriages. While the travellers were passing through Erzurum, the Armenians took advantage of the time when the Russian soldiers were in their dwellings and began to kill the Kurds they had hired. When the Russian soldiers heard the cries of the dying Kurds, they attempted to help them. However, the  Armenians threatened the Russian soldiers by vowing that they would have the same fate if they intervened, and thus prevented them from acting. All these terrifying acts of slaughter were committed with hatred and loathing. Lieutenant Medivani from the Russian Army described an incident that he witnessed in Erzurum as follows: An Armenian had shot a Kurd. The Kurd fell down but did not die. The Armenian attempted to force the stick in his hand into the mouth of the dying Kurd. However, since the Kurd had firmly closed his jaws in his agony, the Armenian failed in his attempt. Having seen this, the Armenian ripped open the abdomen of the Kurd, disembowelled him, and finally killed him by stamping him with the iron heel of his boot. Odishelidge himself told us that all the Turks who could not escape from the village of Ilica were killed. Their heads had been cut off by axes. He also told us that he had seen thousands of murdered children. Lieutenant Colonel Gryaznov, who passed through the village of Ilica, three weeks after the massacre told us the following: There were thousands of dead bodies hacked to pieces, on the roads. Every Armenian who happened to pass through these roads, cursed and spat on the corpses. In the courtyard of a mosque which was about 25x30 meter square, dead bodies were piled to a height of 140  centimeters. Among these corpses were men and women of every age, children and old people. The women's bodies had obvious marks of rape. The genitals of many girls were filled with gun-powder. A few educated Armenian girls, who worked as telephone operators for the Armenian troops were called by Lieutenant Colonel Gryaznov to the courtyard of the mosque and he bitterly told them to be  proud of what the Armenians had done. To the lieutenant colonel's disgusted amazement, the Armenian girls started to laugh and giggle, instead of being horrified. The lieutenant colonel had severely reprimanded those girls for their indecent behaviour. When he told the girls that the Armenians, including women, were generally more licentious than even the wildest animals, and that their indecent and shameful laughter was the most obvious evidence of their inhumanity and barbarity, before a scene that appalled even veteran soldiers, the Armenian girls finally remembered their sense of shame and claimed they had laughed because they were nervous. An Armenian contractor at the Alaca Communication zone command narrated the following incident which took place on February 20: The Armenians had nailed a Turkish women to the wall. They had cut out the women's heart and placed the heart on top of her head. The great massacre in Erzurum began on February 7... The enlisted men  of the artillery division caught and stripped 270 people. Then they took these people into the bath to satisfy their lusts. 100 people among this group were able to save their lives as the result of my decisive attempts. The others, the Armenians claimed, were  released when they learnt that I understood what was going on.  Among those who organized this treacherous act was the envoy to the Armenian officers, Karagodaviev. Today, some Turks were murdered on the streets. On February 12, some Armenians have shot more than ten innocent Moslems. The Russian soldiers who attempted to save these people were threatened with death. Meanwhile I imprisoned an Armenian for murdering an innocent Turk.  When an Armenian officer told an Armenian murderer that he would  be hanged for his crime, the killer shouted furiously: 'How dare you hang an Armenian for killing a Turk?' In Erzurum, the  Armenians burned down the Turkish market. On February 17, I heard that the entire population of Tepekoy village, situated within the artillery area, had been totally annihilated. On the same  day when Antranik entered Erzurum, I reported the massacre to him, and asked him to track down the perpetrators of this horrible act. However no result was achieved. In the villages whose inhabitants had been massacred, there was a natural silence. On the night of 26/27 February, the Armenians deceived the Russians, perpetrated a massacre and escaped for fear of the  Turkish soldiers. Later, it was understood that this massacre had been based upon a method organized and planned in a circular.  The population had been herded in a certain place and then killed one by one. The number of murders committed on that night reached three thousand. It was the Armenians who bragged to about the details of the massacre. The Armenians fighting against the Turkish soldiers were so few in number and so cowardly that they could not even withstand the Turkish soldiers who consisted of only five hundred people and two cannons, for one night, and ran away. The leading Armenians of the community could have prevented this massacre. However, the Armenian intellectuals had shared the same ideas with the renegades in this massacre, just as in all the others. The lower classes within the Armenian community have always obeyed the orders of the leading Armenian figures and commanders.  I do not like to give the impression that all Armenian intellectuals were accessories to these murders. No, for there were people who opposed the Armenians for such actions, since they understood that it would yield no result. However, such people were only a minority. Furthermore, such people were considered as traitors to the Armenian cause. Some have seemingly opposed the Armenian murders but have supported the massacres secretly. Some, on the other hand, preferred to remain silent. There were certain others, who, when accused by the Russians of infamy, would say the following: 'You are Russians. You can never understand the Armenian cause.' The Armenians had a conscience. They would commit massacres and then would flee in fear of the Turkish soldiers. The incidents that occurred only recently clearly manifest the real nature of the Armenian ideology. Nothing which is already done can be undone.""Serdar Argic                           'We closed the roads and mountain passes that                             might serve as ways of escape for the Turks                             and then proceeded in the work of extermination.'

Or is it your interpretation of statements in such literature? Or is this a figment of your imagination or a Nazi Armenian propaganda movie script? In any case, a fascinating piece of analysis. Here are the facts:Source: Walker, Christopher: ""Armenia: The Survival of a Nation.""        New York (St. Martin's Press), 1980.This generally pro-Armenian work contains the following informationof direct relevance to the Nazi Holocaust: a) Dro (the butcher), the former dictator of x-Soviet Armenia and the architect of the genocide of 2.5 million Muslims, the most respected of Nazi Armenian leaders, established an Armenian Provisional Republic in Berlin during World War II; b) this 'provisional government' fully endorsed and espoused the social theories of the Nazis, declared themselves and all Armenians to be members of the Aryan 'Super-Race;' c) they published an Anti-Semitic, racist journal, thereby aligning themselves with the Nazis and their efforts to exterminate the Jews; and, d) they mobilized an Armenian Army of up to 30,000 members which fought side by side with the Wehrmacht. In fact, by 1942, Nazi Armenians in Europe had established a vast network of pro-German collaborators, that extended over two continents. Thousands of Armenians were serving the German army and Waffen-SS in Russia and Western Europe. Armenians were involved in espionage and fifth-column activities for Hitler in the Balkans and Arabian Peninsula. They were promised an 'independent' state under German 'protection' in an agreement signed by the 'Armenian National Council.' (A copy of this agreement can be found in the 'Congressional Record,' November 1, 1945; see Document 1.) On this side of the Atlantic, Nazi Armenians were aware of their brethrens alliance. They had often expressed pro-Nazi sentiments until America entered the war.In 1941, while the Jews were being assembled for their doom in the Naziconcentration camps, the Nazi Armenians in Germany formed the firstArmenian battalion to fight alongside the Nazis. In 1943, this battalion had grown into eight battalions of 30,000-strong under the command of Dro (the butcher), who was the former dictator of x-Soviet Armenia and the architect of the cold-blooded genocide of 2.5 million Turks and Kurds between 1914-1920. An Armenian National Council was formed by the notorious Dashnak Party leaders in Berlin, which was recognized by the Nazis. Encouraged by this, the Armenians summarily formed a provisional government that endorsed and espoused fully the principles of the Nazis and declared themselves as the members of the Aryan super race and full participants to Hitler's policy of extermination of the Jews.This Armenian-Nazi conspiracy against the Jews during WWII was an ""encore""performance staged by the Armenians during WWI, when they back-stabbed andexterminated 2.5 million Muslims by colluding with the invading Russian army.Serdar Argic                           'We closed the roads and mountain passes that                             might serve as ways of escape for the Turks                             and then proceeded in the work of extermination.'

"Newsgroup:talk.religion.miscdocument_id: 82777From: Thyagi@cup.portal.com (Thyagi Morgoth NagaSiva)Subject: ZOROASTRIANISM - SAN JOSE - (Merc News Article)ZOROASTRIANISMSAN JOSE, CA, USAMonday April 5, 1993San Jose Mercury News, Page 1     [Reproduced without permission]_3,700-year tradition still glows -            'Assimilation in U.S. threatens ancient Zoroastrian religion'_By Jeanne Huber, Mercury News Staff Writer   HIGH ON A HILLSIDE above San Jose, flames leap up 24 hours a day from agleaming brass urn in a temple - one of only four in the United States -dedicated to one of the world's most ancient religions.   With the flames go the prayers of about 1,200 Bay Area Zoroastrians thattheir faith will survive this land.   ""There is a fear - a real fear, too,"" said Silloo Tarapore of Lafayette.""We have one generation to do it or to die.""   Many immigrant groups struggle to maintain an identity in a strange land.But for Zoroastrians, it is an especially poignant concern.   Their religion has been around for perhaps 3,700 years, a heritage so deepit scarcely seems comprehensible in a state where ""historical sites"" aresometimes less than 100 years old.  It was the religion of the great PersianEmpire under kings Cyrus and Darius.  And tradition says that when Christwas born about 500 years later, he was honored by a visit from threeZoroastrian priests, the Magi.  Scholars say many key beliefs of Christians,Jews and Muslims can be traced to the teachings of Zoroaster, theZoroastrian prophet.   Yet, with only about 150,000 Zoroastrians in the entire world, they are a miniscule minority in every country in which they live.  Survival as apeople is very much on their minds.   Ironically, local Zoroastrians fear that the almost unlimited toleranceof the United States may do what hundreds of years of persecution followedby nearly 1,000 years of benign religious segregation could not do: causetheir young people to stop thinking of themselves as Zoroastrians.   Zoroastrians do not believe theirs is the only right religion, and theyactually shun the notion of trying to win converts.  So if their childrenbecome totally assimilated, they say, it's their children - rather thanthe world at large - who will be the losers.   ""It's important to have an identity,"" said Maneck Bhujwaia of San Jose,a leader among Zoroastrians who came here from India.  ""It's importantfor everybody - Irish, Scottish, Americans.  It gives meaning to life.You don't have to depend on the majority community to give you respect.You can fall back on your own identity.""   For Zoroastrians, there's much to be proud of.   Their prophet, Zoroaster, seeking to make sense of a culture in whichanimal sacrifice to multiple gods was common, preached that there wasonly one god, a good one.  Zoroastrians call their god Ahura Mazda, whichtranslates as Lord of Wisdom and Light._Good vs. evil_   Zoroaster saw life as a constant struggle between good and evil, withthe good eventually winning.  Men and women could join in the battle forgood, he said, and he warned that they would inevitably suffer consequencessuch as shame and sorrow if they did wrong.  He preached honesty, charity,kindness to animals, respect for the environment, hard work, equality ofmen and women - basic virtues preached by prophets of many religions.   But Zoroaster was perhaps unusual in that he told his followers not tofollow him blindly.  He demanded they think for themselves.  In fact,Joseph Campbell, the famous scholar of the history and meaning of myths,traced the Western emphasis on individual thought to the Zoroastrians.   Zoroastrians have many words for thought.  Their motto, leaded into astained glass window over the sacred fire at the temple on the slopes ofMount Hamilton, is ""Good thoughts, good words, good deeds.""   So it's not surprising that Zoroastrians value education highly.  In India,where a contingent of Zoroastrians arrived in the ninth century to escapepersecution by Muslims in Iran, Zoroastrians claim 100 percent literacy;the overall statistic in India is just 60 percent.   About half of the Bay Area Zoroastrian community came here from Indiaand Pakistan, mostly to study at universities.  The other half fled fromIran after the 1979 revolution made that a fundamentalist Islamic statewhere others had no rights.   Local Zoroastrians point with pride to ways their emphasis on ""gooddeeds"" has improved life in every country they inhabit.  In San Jose,the recent restoration of the Hotel Sainte Clarie came about becauseManou Mobedshahi, a San Francisco-based hotelier, passed the boarded-updowntown landmark on his way to and from the temple.  At the temple'sdedication, the chief guest of honor was the mother of Zubin Mehta, theZoroastrian conductor of the New York Philharmonic Orchestra.   The temple exists because of another good deed: the decision by anIranian emigre, the late Arbab Rustom Guiv, to buy land for six templesin North America.  Besides the 10-acre site off Crothers Road on MountHamilton, he paid for land in Los Angeles, Chicago, New York, Toronto,and Vancouver.  Until his gifts, there were no Zoroastrian temples onthis continent.   Local Zoroastrians raised money to build the actual temple, and theproperty already had a large house that they have converted to acommunity center.   The temple, dedicated a year ago on the birthday of the prophet Zoroaster, is a simple structure with gleaming white walls, vaulted ceilings and oak floors, partially covered with huge Oriental carpets.   Its central feature is the fire, set in the middle of a partly-glassed-in area at the center of the building.  Although Zoroastrians are sometimes called ""fire worshippers,"" they actually consider fire just a symbol of God.  ""It helps us concentrate, just like Christians use the cross and Muslims use the Holy Book,"" Bhujwala said.   The biggest celebration of the years occurs in early spring.  For allIranians, including Zoroastrians, the New Year begins on the first day ofthe season because of its symbolism as the start of new life.  WithZoroaster's birthday just six days later, the combination of religiousand secular holidays creates something on par with what most of theUnited States celebrates between Christmas and Jan. 1.  For this year's celebration of the prophet's birthday, about 500 peoplecame to worship and revel.   ""The good things in life are not forbidden,"" Esfandiar Anoushiravani,a leader of the Iranian members, had said beforehand, and what followedproved him right.   Inside the temple, worshipers filled every chair and sat or stoodaround the edges of the room as about a half-dozen priests chantedthanksgiving prayers around a table laden with braziers of smokingsandalwood, glasses of milk and water, and a tray heaped with dried fruitand nuts.   Kids crowded around, grabbing handfuls of the treats.  ""People eat thefruit,"" Tarapore said.  ""It's a way to participate in the ceremony.""_Santa Claus, sort of_   The gathering even had a Santa Claus, Iranian style.  With flowing whitehair and a bag of gifts for the children, this Amownaroz wore greensymbolic of spring) and red.   He was ushed in by a sort of spring clown, Hajefyrouz, who danced andplayed a tambourine.   The Zoroastrians from India were charmed.  ""This is all new for us, too,""one told a visitor who asked what was going on.   A visitor, John A. Sabanovich of Folsom, said he became intrigued withthe religion years ago while on business trips to Iran.  Zoroastrians haveno procedure for accepting converts - a result, some say, of theircenturies of persecution in Iran followed by their promise to the Hinduking who allowed them into India that they would not interfere with hispeople's religion.   But that does not stop Sabavich from joining in the celebrations at theSan Jose temple whenever he can.   ""When I first heard about this religion,"" he said, ""I thought, my God,this is what a religion should be.  They think for themselves and do good.

But that isonly for some of the players.  Many of the rest, who have been playing withinjuries, who miss their families, or who, like Grant Fuhr, would reallyrather be playing golf, don't really give a damn.  Of course I can't say thisfor sure, but I believe that this is fairly typical of human nature and Idon't think that hockey players are above having what I consider typicallyhuman attitudes.  With the recent salary escalations the key players are actually losing money by participating in the playoffs.  The ones who regard the playoff""take"" as some kind of a bonanza are fringe players who are unlikelyto consistently be a force in the playoffs.  Now I know some of you aregoing to come back with ""winning spirit"" and all of that crap but theseplayers are professionals after all.  While they may love to play the game that love is entirely incidental to their purpose, which is, to makea decent living. Of course, the coach is a professional as well, and part of what he is being paid to do is motivate the players.  So, if the coach does hisjob well enough the players may respond with a winning effort.The second season, is after all, merely an exhibition.  The true Championsof the league are the division winners, the teams that come out on top after the long struggle of the season.  The Stanley cup playoffs merelyaccord victory to the team that has remained healthy and ""hot"".  The emphasis on the playoffs, with their ""sudden death"" appeal has been promotedby the media and the owners with profit purely in mind.  Even if Pittsburghloses the playoffs, we all know that they were really the best team in theleague over the year.  They proved it.cordially, as always,rm-- Roger Maynard maynard@ramsey.cs.laurentian.ca"	rec.sport.hockey

If one denies the existence of spiritual things, one would presumably call these ""emotional needs"". The reason Christians call them spiritual needs is that they have aspects that are not fulfillable except by spiritual means--ie a person could be loved and accepted by many people, and do many meaningful things, but still have a need for love, which can only besatisfied by the love of God.  Now the problem is that there are people whoaccept the existence of these needs, and people who reject them.  Since Ibelieve in absolute truth, some of these people are right, and the othersare wrong.  So here are the 2 possibilities:1) If Christians are right, then we all have spiritual needs--iewe all need God.  Those who do not realize that they need God are deluded--they just haven't recognized it yet.2) If Christians are wrong, spiritual needs are an artefact of our brainchemicals.  Well-adjusted and properly-integrated personalities do nothave such things.  Christians are simply using the concept of God and spiritual needs to mask their own inadequacies.I hate to belabour the point, but the existence of spirits and spiritualneeds cannot be objectively demonstrated or proven, just like the existenceof God cannot.  And yes, this means that there is a risk that all my subjectiveevidence is manufactured by my brain chemicals.  But on the other hand, I could venture into solipsism and say that there is a risk that everything thatI appear to objectively know is really manufactured by my brain chemicals.I suspect this is an unsatisfactory answer to a request for evidence anddemonstration of the existence of spirits and spiritual needs, but my assertionis that such things are not objectively demonstrable.

Version 1.21 is mainly a bugfix for THINK C users. THIS VERSIONNOW RUNS WITH THINK C, I PROMISE! The Docs now contain a chapter forC programmers on how to use the GrafSys. If you have problems, feel free to contact me.The other change is that I removed the FastPerfTrig calls fromthe FPU version to make it run faster.Those of you who don't know what all this is about, read on.********Programmers 3D GrafSys -- What it is:-------------------------------------Didn't you always have this great game in mind where you needed some way of drawing three-dimensional scenes? Didn't you always want to write this program that visualized the structure of three-dimensional molecules?And didn't the task of writing your 3D conversions routines keep you from actually doing it?Well if the answer to any of the above questions is 'Yes, but what has it to do with this package???' , read on.GrafSys is a THINK Pascal/C library that provides you with simple routines for building, saving, loading (as resources), and manipulating (independent rotating around arbitrary achses, translating and scaling) three dimensional objects. Objects, not just simple single-line drawings.GrafSys supports full 3D clipping, animation and some (primitive) hidden-line/hidden-surface drawing with simple commands from within YOUR PROGRAM.GrafSys also supports full eye control with both perspective and parallelprojections (If you can't understand a word, don't worry, this is just showingoff for those who know about it. The docs that come with it will try to explainwhat it all means later on). GrafSys provides a powerful interface to supply your own drawing routines withdata so you can use GrafSys to do the 3D transformations and your own routinesto do the actual drawing. (Note that GrafSys also provides drawing routines soyou don't have to worry about that if you don't want to)GrafSys 1.11 comes in two versions. One for the 881 and 020 or above processors. The other version uses fixed-point arithmetic and runs on any Mac.Both versions are *100% source compatibel*. GrafSys comes with an extensive manual that teaches you the fundamentals of 3Dgraphics and how to use the package.If demand is big enough I will convert the GrafSys to an object-class library. However, I feelt that the way it is implemented now makes it easier to use fora lot more people than the select 'OOP-Guild'.GrafSys is free for any non-commercial usage.

The following is from a critique of a ""60 Minutes"" presentation on MSG   which was aired on November 3rd, 1991.  The critique comes from THE TUFTS   DIET AND NUTRITION LETTER, February 1992.  [...edited for brevity...]	""Chances are good that if you watched '60 Minutes' last November	3rd [1991], you came away feeling MSG is bad for you. [...] In	the segment entitled 'No MSG,' for instance, show host Ed Bradley	makes alarming statements without adequately substantiating them	('millions are suffering a host of symptoms, and some get violently	sick'); peppers his report with sensational but clinically unproven	personal testimony...; and speaks of studies on MSG that make the	substance seem harmful without explaining just how inconclusive 	those studies are.	Consider his making reference at the beginning of the program to	a study conducted at the Eastern Virginia Medical School in order	to back up his comment that there is 'a lot of evidence' that MSG,	a flavor enhancer in Chinese and other Asian cuisines as well as	in many supermarket items, causes headaches.  What he does NOT	make reference to is the fact that the study was performed not on	humans but on rabbits.	One of the researchers who conducted the study, pharmacologist	Patricia Williams, Ph.D., says it certainly is conceivable that	a small minority of people are sensitive enough to MSG to get 	headaches from it.  'But,' she explains, 'the show probably 	overemphasized the extent of the problem.'	A second lapse comes with mention of Dr. John Olney, a professor	at the Washington University School of Medicine who, Mr. Bradley	remarks, 'says that his 20 years of research with laboratory	animals shows MSG is a hazard for developing youngsters' because	it poses a threat of irreversible brain damage.  Dr. Olney's	research with lab animals does not 'show' anything about human	youngsters.	In fact, only under extreme circumsrtances did Dr. Olney's 	experiments ever bring about any brain damage: when he injected	extremely high doses of MSG into rodents, completely bypassing 	their digestive tracts and entering their bloodstreams more directly,	and when he used tubes to force-feed huge amounts of the substance	to very young animals on an empty stomach.  Of course, neither	of those procedures occurs with humans; they simply take in MSG 	with food.  And most of what they take in is broken down by	enzymes in the wall of the small intestine, so that very little	reaches the bloodstream -- much to little, in fact, for human	blood levels of MSG to come anywhere near the high concentrations	found in Dr. Olney's lab animals.....	The World Health Organization appears to be very much aware of	that fact.  And so does the European Communities' Scientific	Committee for Food....Both, after examining numerous studies,	have concluded that MSG is safe.	Their determination makes sense, considering that MSG has never	been proven to cause all the symptoms that have been attributed	to it -- headaches, swelling, a tightness in the chest, and a	burning sensation, among others.  In fact, the most fail-safe	of clinical studies, the double-blind study..., has consistently	exonerated the much-maligned substance.	That's quite fortunate since the alleged hazardous component of	monosodium glutamate, glutamate, enters our systems whenever	we eat any food that contains protein.  The reason is that one	of the amino acids that make up protein, glutamic acid, is broken	down into glutamate during digestion.	It's a breakdown that occurs frequently.

It is stressed in appeal that the experience of five-years of fightingfor independence from imperial chains shows a grim process . The waragainst Azerbaijan under the pretence of protecting the human rights of the Armenians of Ukhari (Upper) Garabag, has meant the destruction ofAzeri villages and towns, occupation of 10 percent of the territory, 60thousand new refugees in addition to 500 thousand already in place.This is all the price of fighting for liberty from Russian imperial rule,is said in the document.    Azerbaijan's government appeals to all compatriots to make everyeffort to inform the people of the world about the truth in Azerbaijan,and to assistance in solving the problems facing the young state.   It is stressed in the appeal that there is urgent need for medicine,food, experienced doctors and financial help to settle refugees fromKelbajar, Fizuli and Lachin regions, and to render medical aid for the sick and the wounded men.--O--60 REFUGEES FROM KELBAJAR PERISHED IN THEIR ESCAPE LORRIES      BAKU (APRIL 5) TURAN: Today, during the evacuation from Kelbajarregion, 60 refugees on board two lorries were killed in the fire from theArmenian Tanks on the only road to leave Kelbajar. According to press-service of Azerbaijan president, no one survived the tragedy. --O--SITUATION IN THE REGION OF KELBAJAR   BAKU (5 APRIL) TURAN: Attempts to evacuate the rest of 15,000citizens, encircled on alpine villages of the region of Kelbajar went on within the last twenty-four hours. Evacuation helicopterscould not land near these villages because of shelling from theArmenian side and existence of fog. Measures are undertaken to air-dropfood and medicine to the encircled people.   Several hundred people succeed within the last twenty-four hours toget out of the region of Kelbajar via mountain range. Refugees are settled in the neighboring regions of Azerbaijan and in Ganja. Authorities face serious problem with rendering refugees medical aid and food. The number of refugees from Kelbajar is over 40,000 people.Azerbaijan is not capable of handling a disaster of this magnitude.--0--ARMENIAN ARMY CONTINUES ATTACK ON FIZULI   BAKU (5 APRIL) TURAN: The region of Fizuli of Azerbaijan, situated outside of the territory of Daglig (Nagorno) Garabag, has beensubjected to heaviest attacks of Armenian army for the fourth day. About30 armored technique and more than 500 soldiers of the enemy are takingpart in the attack.   Armenian units broke the defence line of the azeri forces and occupiedthe ruling height from where the town is shelled from ""Grad"" installations,this morning. There is heavy destructions in the town and more than 20people are dead. Population of the town is hastily evacuated.--0--PRESS-CONFERENCE OF THE CHIEF OF PRESS-SERVICE OF PRESIDENT OF AZERBAIJAN   BAKU (5 APRIL) TURAN: Fifty-five thousand refugees from the regionof Kelbajar were taken out by 11 o'clock on April 5, informed the chiefof the press-service of president of Azerbaijan, Arif Aliev, today.   Journalists were also informed at the press-conference thatInternational Red Cross is helping to accept and render refugees medicalaid. There is an urgent need to supply the refugees with tents, food andmedical aid.   Arif Aliev informed that as a result of the ongoing tragedy broughton by the latest aggression of Armenia, the leadership of Azerbaijanintends to appeal to Azerbaijanis and all those who treasure human lifeall over the world for help.   Concerning the reaction of the international community to aggression of Armenia, Aliev said the department of state of the USA has expressedits anxiety to leadership of Armenia.   Participants of peace efforts in Daglig (Nagorno) Garabag underCSCE, Rafaelli, Mareska and Chetin strongly blamed the aggression of Armenia against Azerbaijan.   Leader of press-service informed that tomorrow ambassador of Azerbaijan in Russia, Hikmet Haji-zade, will conduct a press-conferencein Moscow. Detailed information on latest events in the region ofKelbajar of Azerbaijan will be given at the press-conference.--0--AZERBAIJANIS PICKET IN FRONT OF MINISTRY OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS OF RUSSIA   BAKU (5 APRIL) TURAN: Azerbaijanis, living in Moscow, picketedin front of the building of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Russia.Picket was conducted as a token of protest against participation ofRussian units in capture of the region of Kelbajar of Azerbaijan byArmenians. About 100 people took part in the picket, organized byAzerbaijani society ""Dayag"".--0--PICKET OF SADVALERS IN MOSCOW   BAKU (5 APRIL) 30-40 members of ""Sadval"" society picketed beforethe building of permanent representation of Azerbaijan in Moscow.Picketers were demanding the return of Lezghins lands, as if annexedby Azerbaijan.   Ambassador of Azerbaijan in Moscow, Hikmet Haji-zade classifiedthis action as provocation aimed at creating a further inter-ethnicconflict in Azerbaijan. He marked in his talk with the Turancorrespondent that he does not rule out a connection between theArmenian aggression in the region of Kelbajar and this anti-azerbaijani action of the ""Sadval"" society in Moscow. He alsomarked that 30-40 people do not mean the Lezghian nationality inthe whole.   Society of Lezghins, ""Sadval"", registered in Moscow in 1990,demands the creation of a Lezghistan state, which never existedbefore on the northern territories of Azerbaijan.--0--ATTACK OF ARMENIAN UNITS STOPPED   BAKU (5 APRIL) TURAN: Attack of Armenian army on the town of Fizuli, which began in the last twenty-four hours, is stopped, informs the press-service of the Ministry of Defence of Azerbaijan.   In the result of undertaken measures, 6 tanks and a number of the attackers were destroyed. Advance units of the Armenian armyretreated several kilometers.   Chairman of the parliament, Isa Gambar, visited the town of Fizuli and met with commanders of the units of the national armyand local citizens, today.--0--STATEMENT OF MINISTRY OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS OF AZERBAIJAN   BAKU (5 APRIL) TURAN: Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Azerbaijan issued a statement in connection with aggression of Armenia in theregion of Kelbajar of Azerbaijan.   It is stated in the statement that regular units of the armedforces of Armenia captured the town of Kelbajar on April 3 .  Attack of Armenian units, which began on March 27 deep in theterritory of Azerbaijan still continues. Armenia has occupied atpresent 7500 sq.km of the territory of Azerbaijan.   Spreading of Armenian aggression far away from Ukhari (Upper)Garabag proves that the Armenian-Azerbaijani conflicts has entered aspecially dangerous phase. This is the result of non-recognition of Armenia as an aggressor by the international community, is markedin the document.   It is stressed in the statement that the units of the 7th Russianarmy are participating in the Armenian attack. This casts doubt onthe sincerity of Russian mediation efforts in finding a peacefulsolution to the conflict.   It is marked in conclusion that aggressive actions of Armenia have wrecked the negotiation process under aegis of CSCE.   The document contains the appeal to the world community to stopArmenian aggression and to use political and economic sanctionsagainst the aggressor.--0--Serdar Argic                           'We closed the roads and mountain passes that                             might serve as ways of escape for the Turks                             and then proceeded in the work of extermination.'

I recieved in the mail today the spec sheets on the mil.spec version of Exar's XR-2240 timer/counter chip. It is stable down to -50 Cand sucks very little power. They show an application for a ultra-long timedelay (up to several years depending on the RC time constant). In thisapplication, they have two of them cascaded together. The reset and triggerpins of both chips are tied together and the timebase of the second chip isdisabled. In this configuration, the output is high when the system is reset.When triggered, the output goes low and stays that way for a total of 65,536 xthe timing cycle of the first chip. The total timing cycle of the two chips canbe programmed from To = 256 x R x C to 65,536 x R x C in 256 steps by selectingany combination of the counter outputs to the timer output. The beauty of itis, the timebase chip would only have to have a 100uF timing cap and a 391Kresistor for 39.1 seconds per timing cycle. So I can get a maximum of2,562,457.6 seconds between timing cycles (39.1 x 65,536 or about 29 days !)Of course, that's much more than I need (14 days). But the counter allows for256 binary steps that can be selected for the output for the 'pellet puker'.After the first 14 days and it trips, it would reset its self for the next 14day timing cycle and so forth.Power is still a problem though. A few ideas that you suggested was to bury theelectronics in a hole dug in the snow (as an insulator) and put the pelletpuker up on a tower above the estimated snow fall with a solar panel on it tokeep a charge on a lithium battery pack. I like that idea ;-) This thing has towork for at least six weeks for three samples and the gas valves are 12 voltsto spit the pellets out onto the snow. Anyway, I ordered the XR-2240's to seewhat I can do with them. Should be interesting (as long as I'm not the one thathas to go digging up the pellets in the middle of Antartica freezing my bunsoff ;-)Thanks again everyone...-=-= Wes =-=-	sci.electronics

No agency such as the NSA (or whoever) would approve the public release of a crypto-system, if they didn't already have the technicalmeans or the know-how to decrypt everything at their whim. Surely the wholepoint of all this madness is to make Joe Public think that his/hercommunications will be kept safe, while James Bond at the NSA can, if needbe, have full, decrypted access to someone's communications?

As ""Azerbaijan"" newspaper informs, the issue of attractionof western investments in Azerbaijan was discussed in the meeting. Inparticular, Gulyiev stated that western capital has to be investigated inthe most profitable spheres of manufacture. He also noticed, that the numberof the priority manufactures will be released from debts. Guliyev also said that intensifying the activities of the American oil companies will promote the strengthening of the American-Azeri relations.THE PROPOSAL TO SUMMON SPECIAL SESSION OF THE SUPREME SOVIET IS REJECTED AGAIN   Baku (May 19) Turan: Yesterday, in the sitting of the Milli Mejlis,the chairman, Isa Gambar, rejected the proposal of the deputy ArifRahimzade to summon a special session of the Supreme Soviet of Azerbaijan.  This written proposal to summon a session was signed by 130 deputates. Butthe chairman said that the signatures were invalid and the proposal couldn'tbe submitted for discussion.   Earlier, the leadership of the Milli Mejlis called the proposal to summona special session of the Supreme Soviet a coup attempt. But the deputy forthe Parliament, Rahimzade, doesn't consider that the deputates have the objective of removing Milli Mejlis and its chairman from the power. It concerns theserious analysis of the social, economic and foreign policy activity of therepublic's authority. Rahimzade said that the deputates for the Parliament,ejected from their duties one year ago have the rights to express their opinionon these questions.   The Supreme Soviet of Azerbaijan (340 deputates) was dissolved one year ago,when it attempted to bring Ayaz Mutalibov back to the power.   The functions of S.S. were handed over to Milli Mejlis, consisting of 50deputates (25 ""democrats"" and 25 ""partocrates""). At that time ""democrats"" and""partocrates"" came to an agreement that Milli Mejlis wouldn't exist for a long time and would be dissolved after parliamentary elections. At the same time,the deputates ejected from their duties were guaranteed that they could summona session of the Supreme Soviet any time and went in for political activity outof the Parliament. --0--THE PROSPECTS OF TRADE/ECONOMIC COOPERATION BETWEEN AZERBAIJAN AND ESTONIA    Baku (May 19) Turan: The prospects of signing trade-economic agreementbetween Azerbaijan and Estonia were discussed in the meeting of the Foreign Minister Tofig Gasimov with the group of experts of the Ministry of Economics,Minister of Foreign Affairs and Estonian Bank administration on May 18.

According to Abbas Abbasov, the pact of cooperation proposals, submitted forthe discussion of the leaders of CIS states in Moscow on May 14, has a numberof unfavorable points for Azerbaijan.

Accounts of the witnesses and the confessions of the condemned themselves,prove that their crimes were committed together with the Armenian military unitsand with the knowledge of the headquarters of the Russian army unit, where theyserved.

Certain Russian circles try to conceal the fact of direct participation ofthe Russian army in the undeclared war of Armenia against Azerbaijan from theRussian community. Azerbaijan's prosecutor's announcement follows, that thistype of actions can make the situation in the region much more complicated.--0--AZERBAIJAN'S PARLIAMENT INTENDS TO APPEAL TO RUSSIAN PARLIAMENT REGARDING THESIX ACCUSED SOLDIERS     BAKU (MAY 20) TURAN: As Turan agency was informed, parliament of Azerbaijanis considering the question of appealing to Russian parliament about the sixaccused soldiers' fortune. In particular, the offer to send the representativesof the Commission on military affairs of the armed forces of Russian Federationto Baku for the detailed study of the results of six Russian soldiers' case willbe directed to Russian parliament.     According to one of the supporters of this offer, such initiative will giveRussian parliament the possibility to be convinced of the correctness of theinvestigation. There will also be a chance to discuss the reasons that havegiven rise to the present situation - that is the Russian troops participationin the war against Azerbaijan.ARMENIANS ARE PREPARING MORE ""KARABAKHS"" ON THE NORTH CAUCASUS     BAKU (MAY 20) TURAN: The National-liberation front founded by group of Armenians living on the North Caucasus appealed to establish Armenian autonomieson the territories of Rostov, Stavropol and Krasnodar regions, - reported thenewspaper ""Russky vestnik"" on March 9, 1993 published in Geneva.     The North Caucasus is regarded as an integral part of Armenia in the documents of this organization. Admitting the non-realizability of ""reunion"" ofthe North Caucasus and ""Armenia proper"" at present, the front is appealing to the UN, presidents of Russia, Armenia and the United States to consider theneed to establish Armenian autonomies on the Caucasus.     To attain these goals, the Armenian organization considers it necessary tocarry out on the North Caucasus the forms and methods of activity ""identical tothose in Nagorno Karabakh"". Besides the decision to fund cells of Armeniannational-liberation fronts in every settlement and to appeal to leaders ofArmenian terrorist groups in Greece and Iran to sent to the North Caucasus instructors for training of Armenian youth to wage secret wars was adopted.     Thus according to the newspaper ""Russky vestnik"", ""new Karabakhs"" are being planning on the North Caucasus. --O--STATE ASSISTANCE FOR NATIONAL MINORITY DEVELOPMENT     BAKU (MAY 20) TURAN: The meeting headed by the State secretary ofAzerbaijan, Ali Kerimov, with the participation of the national culturalcenters was held in Baku. The first results of the realization of the presidentElchibey's decree on state assistance for the development of language andculture of national minorities adopted on September 16, 1992 were considered.      The State secretary called this decree as an important step to establish alegal democratic state. He confirmed once more the commitment of the leadershipof Azerbaijan to set up a democratic society in which the rights of all nationalities and ethnic groups would be respected.     The State Counsellor of the president of Azerbaijan on the national policy,Hidayat Orujev, announced that in spite of the difficulties of the ""undeclaredwar"" against the republic, the leaders of the state managed to solve many problems concerning the satisfaction of cultural and other needs of the ethnicgroups.      For today, all 33 national-cultural centers registered by the Ministry ofJustice in the capital of Azerbaijan are provided with accommodation, furniture and means of communication. All the accommodations are rent-free ( 8 foreigndiplomatic missions in Baku are placed in the hotels because of the absence offree accommodations including the representation of the UN General secretary).      As it was noted, a great work was carried out since the decree was adoptedto create conditions for total development of the ethnic groups. On the North ofAzerbaijan where Lezghins live, a national Lezghin theater was opened, radiocast is transmitted in Lezghin. The work over the creation of theeducational literature for Talyshs, Tats, Lezghins and Kurds and nationalteaching and scientific staff is being carried out in the Academy of Sciencesof Azerbaijan.--O-- MEMORANDUM OF COOPERATION ON EXTRACTING OIL-GAS FIELDS OF AZERBAIJAN WAS SIGNED     BAKU (MAY 20) TURAN: As Turan agency was informed in the State concern ""Azerineft"", the Memorandum of understanding with the companies""AMOCO Caspian Sea Petroleum"", ""Bi-Pi Exploration Operating"", ""PennzoilCaspian"", ""Unocal Khazar Ltd."", ""McDermott"" and Turkish oil corporation onmutual extracting of fields ""Azeri"", ""Chirag"" and ""Gyuneshli"" was signed. According to the memorandum, the general group on preparing of a commonprogram of activity was created.      According to the president of ""Azerineft"", Sabit Bagirov, cooperationwill provide for using the experience of foreign companies more efficiently.      During the project, the main principles will be the effective use ofoil-gas resources, the rational sharing of investments, the reducing ofexploitation expenditures and maximizing the profit of Azerbaijan from theexploitation of these fields. The memorandum also envisions the necessity to take into account the historicaland political-economical interests of Azerbaijan under optimum use of oil-gasfields. --O--ARMENIA TAKING ADVANTAGE OF THE PROSECUTION OF SIX RUSSIAN SOLDIERS     BAKU (MAY 21) TURAN: After Azerbaijani court passed sentence on six Russian soldiers fighting on the Armenian side in Karabakh,Armenian propaganda has become actively involved.     The Armenians living in Russia appealed to the president Yeltsinwith a request ""to display firmness in asserting the rights of Russiansoldiers"". At the same time, Armenian mass media call legal proceedingson the case in Baku as ""a farce aimed at getting more arms from Russia"".     The Karabakh Armenians have issued a threat recently. If one couldbelieve the Yerevan agency ""Snark"", the Armenians in Karabakh presentedan ultimatum to authorities in Azerbaijan. The essence of this ultimatumis that if Russian soldiers are not shown mercy, three Azeri prisoners inKarabakh will be shot dead.     It is simple to explain such ""touching attitude of Armenians"" tothe six Russian soldiers' fate. If by chance the sentence is executedit will cause not anti-Azeri but anti-Armenian reaction, as the accusedRussian soldiers were recruited in Yerevan by the former Defence Ministerof Armenia and then transferred to Karabakh.     If the soldiers get mercy, Armenian side will think highly of itssaving of lives of ""innocent Russians"". --O--NEW PROVOCATIONS OF ARMED FORCES OF ARMENIA     BAKU (MAY 21) TURAN: According to the Defence Ministry ofAzerbaijan on May 20-21, the firing on the territories of Azerbaijanfrom the military bases on the territory of Armenia was in progress.     The day before, the villages of Kolly-Gyshlag, Shotaraz,Nyachaflar of Zangelan district of Azerbaijan were under fire fromKafan district of Armenia. Two inhabitants were wounded, there weredestructions in the villages.     On May 20, the firing on the villages of Bashkend, Mutudere,Shynykh, Novosaratovka and Novoivanovka of Kedabek district ofAzerbaijan from the positions of Armenian armed forces was inprogress.     At the same day the diversion group of the armed forces ofArmenia (50-60 men) violated the frontier of Azerbaijan, penetratedinto the territory of Kedabek district of Azerbaijan, killed twoshepherds at the village of Aili-Dara and made an attempt to take aflock across the frontier. Azeri frontier-guards stopped the enemy.--O--""UNOCAL"" COMPANY WILL BUILD 50 HOUSES FOR REFUGEES IN AZERBAIJAN     BAKU (MAY 21) TURAN: As Turan agency was informed by therepresentation of UNOCAL American oil company, the leaders of thiscompany decided to give 750 thousand dollars for the construction of50 houses for refugees.     At present, the American side suggested a village project for consideration by appropriate departments of Azerbaijan. The projectis a farm village where each house has a personal lot, subsidiaryaccommodations and so on.     According to the program the construction and putting intooperation of the village will be this year. --O--MANAT IS BEGINNING TO FALL IN VALUE     BAKU (MAY 21) TURAN: Lately, at the black market of Baku, thenational currency - Manat, fell in price compared with the RussianRuble. Thus one gives 1100 Rubles or 120 Manats for one US dollar.Taking into account the official exchange-value of the Manat with respect to Ruble which is 1-10, the national currency fell in value10 percent. Meanwhile the exchange-value of the Manat to the Ruble isthe same at banks, state establishments and in trade.     According to the representatives of the business circles andexperts, the present situation is explained by the fact that the rublesare bought by the local businessmen. They need rubles for financialoperations in Russia. As the remittance of payments from the republicsof the former USSR to Russia is a great problem now, many businessmenarrange deals in cash. Taking into consideration the volume of business with Russia, counted by billions, it is not hard to imagine how much Rubles in cash the businessmen need. --O--THE DISCUSSION OF PARLIAMENTARY ELECTION BILL WILL LAST TILL MID JULY    Baku (May 22) Turan: According to the president's decree, theexpert group, including representatives of the Parliament and presidential apparatus, are working out new wording of the Constitutionof the Republic of Azerbaijan. This must be adopted by Milli Mejlis beforethe Parliamentary elections. Together with this, the work on the newConstitution, that would be, evidently, adopted by new Parliament ofthe country, is going on. The newsmen were informed about the work on thepress-conference of the Supreme Soviet of the republic the day before.    Parliamentary legal experts, Safa Mirzoyev, Simran Hasanov and representatives of the department of the president's apparatus Fazil Mustafaevand Shahin Aliev took part in the press-conference.    The national discussion of the project of the Parliamentaryelection law is going on at present. According to Simran Hasanov the billdidn't cause any objections. It was noted, that until now, no alternativevariant of the election law was put forward.   The newsmen were also informed, that Parliamentary commissionswill examine all coming proposals till June 10. By June 15 allproposals will be generalized and submitted for discussion in Milli Mejlis.--0--ISA GAMBAR SUGGESTS THAT AZERI-RUSSIAN PARLIAMENT COMMISSION FOR CLARIFYING THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CRIMINAL CASE BE CREATED   BAKU (MAY 22) TURAN: The Chairman of the Milly Mejlis of theAzerbaijan republic, Isa Gambar, sent the return letter to the Chairmanof the Russian Supreme Soviet Ruslan Khasbulatov in connection withthe conviction of the Russian servicemen lieutenant V.Semion, sergeantK. Tukish, M.Lisov and A.Filipov by the military college of theSupreme Court of Azerbaijan.   In his letter, Isa Gambar suggested that the commission of AzerbaijanMilly Mejlis deputates on a par with the experts of the Russian SupremeSoviet be established to clarify the circumstances of this criminalcase. In his view, ""the conclusion of the commission could help in the objective solving of this problem, as well as such kind of problemsin the future. But the main thing is, it could help to promote theknowledge about involvement of the Russian servicemen in crime"".   In its turn, in connection with the Russian parliament message,Milly Mejlis adopted a resolution on May 19, according to which thepermanent commissions on government building and legal policy, humanrights and international relations are charged with the exploration ofthis problem.--0--WILL THE TRILATERAL INITIATIVE BE RUINED?      Baku (May 22) Turan: As Turan agency was informed, Russian representativeto the talks on Karabakh, Vladimir Kazimirov, doubted in realization of the Trilateral initiative. He expressed this opinion during a telephone talk withthe representatives of Azerbaijan. At the same talk he declared, that in casethe peace process deadlocked, Russia would pursue Yeltsin's initiative itself.     Such statement from the Russian diplomat, who is one of the authorsof the Trilateral initiative, suggests that the Russian leadership ispaving the way for complete exclusion of the USA and probably Turkey fromthe peacemaking process. This statement can also mean, that Russia andUS having achieved understanding on Bosnian problem, have agreed on partialUS departure from Transcaucasia.--0--FATE OF 645 MILLION TONS OF OIL WILL BE DECIDED THIS SUMMER   Baku (May 22) Turan: The president of Azerbaijan State Oil Company,Sabit Bagirov, declared recently that complete treaty on development ofoil fields Chirag, Azeri and Guneshli would be signed this summer.As it is known, western oil companies AMOCO, BP-STATOIL, PENNZOIL-RAMCO have an interest on development of these three richest Caspianfields.   According to the plan, SOCAR and BP-STATOIL are to sign a completetreaty on development of Chirag field on June 16. Later AMOCO andPENNZOIL will sign treaties.   Specialists value total reserves of these three fields to be 645million ton. 310 million of them fall on Azeri field, 180 mln.tonon Geneshli and 150 mln.ton on Chirag.   The exploitation of these fields is to last tens of years and it is tobring in Azerbaijan 100 billion dollars in revenue. In addition to the neteconomic profit, Baku calculates upon the political support of the West inthe defence of its interests at the international scene.   As president Elchibey said in his closest encirclement ""the May of1993 will be one of the most difficult periods for Azerbaijan and itsindependence and we have to stand these tests"".--0--THE SCIENTIST-LAWYERS OF RUSSIA APPEALED TO THE PRESIDENT OF AZERBAIJAN   BAKU (MAY 22) TURAN: As the press-service of the president of Azerbaijaninforms, today, the appeal of the Institute of the Government and law of theRussian Academy of Sciences to president Elchibey was received.The appeal contains the call ""to display mercy, humanism and clemency on the death sentences of the former servicemen of the Russian ArmedForces"".   The authors of the appeal point out, that they don't justify theparticipation of the Russian servicemen in the war against the azeri people,don't call in question the lawfulness of the passed sentence, denouncethe mercenary according to the UN principals, and they are sorry about theRussian servicemen being drawn in such grave crime.    At the end of their letter, scientists, mentioning the soldiers'mothers' tears and grief, their praying day and night of safety, ask thepresident of Azerbaijan to ""save those guys"".   It should be noticed, that unlike lawyers, soldiers' mothers,taking part in the inquiry, called the cause of their grief onlyRussian policy. According to their words, the leaders, that lay downlives of Russian men to achieve their political aims, must be madeanswerable.    Unfortunately, the appeal didn't mention the grief of the mothersof Azerbaijani soldiers, killed by sentenced Russian servicemen.--0--ARMENIAN ARTILLERY CONTINUES FIRING ON AZERI DISTRICTS     BAKU (MAY 22) TURAN: On May 22, two soldiers of National army ofAzerbaijan were killed during the ""Grad"" shelling of the villages ofKolly Gyshlag, Shaifly, Shotaraz, Nyachaflar of Zangelan district ofthe republic from the territory of Kafan district of Armenia.     The night before and in the morning of May 22, the villages ofTovuz, Gazakh and Gubatly districts of Azerbaijan were under firefrom the territory of Armenia. There are destructions.      The situation in Agder district of Azerbaijan became complicated. On May 21, the enemy fired on the regional centre of Agdere from thevillage of Ortakend. The transportation of man power and military equipmentto this district is in progress. According to reports the enemy is settingup a new weapon emplacement to fire on the regional centre and near byvillages.     According to the Ministry of Internal Affairs, the concentrationof man power and military equipment is observed in Krasnoselskydistrict of Armenia which borders on Azerbaijan as well as on thefrontier with Fizuli district. --O--AZERI PRIME-MINISTER IS LEAVING FOR GREAT BRITAIN  BAKU ( MAY 22 ) TURAN : The Minister of Foreign Economic Relations,Rauf Garayev, in his interview to Turan agency said, that""Great Britain is the biggest foreign economic partner of Azerbaijanafter Iran"". The business cooperation between the two countriesdevelops in such spheres as oil - industry, the manufacture of oilextraction equipment, communication and agriculture.  According to the Minister's words, the forthcoming visit ofAzerbaijani Prime-Minister, Panah Huseynov, to Great Britain on May23-24, is very important. It is expected, that the visit willhelp, to solve the problems of opening in Azerbaijan the branchoffices of some British banks, insurance firms; to concludecontracts on the sphere of manufacture of agricultural equipment; onbuilding in Azerbaijan off shore oil platforms, and reconstruction of theentire communication system of Azerbaijan.   In Garayev's view, the expansion of the cooperation with Great Britainwill have a great political meaning for Azerbaijan.   According to politicians and reviewers in Baku, at present, GreatBritain as an European state is close to Azerbaijan. The continuation ofthe economic and political cooperation of the two states is foreseen. --O--           \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\              T U R A N    N E W S    A G E N C Y                     Baku - Azerbaijan                      Phone: (8922) 66-7977  66-7833                    Fax: (8922) 66-2009                   Telex: 142168 META SU           \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\                  Serdar Argic                           'We closed the roads and mountain passes that                             might serve as ways of escape for the Turks                             and then proceeded in the work of extermination.'

You want to dismiss us, and use the sleaziest means>you can think of to do so.I can see you have a revulsion for bestiality that far exceeds my distaste for homosexuality.  Certainly if I spoke about homosexuality the way you speak of bestiality, nobody would have any trouble labelling me a homophobe.  Let me ask this gently:  why are you so judgemental of other people's sexual preferences?  What happened to ""No doubt I am free to do anything""?  I think you have a serious double standard here.  When you describe a comparison between homosexuality and bestiality as ""slimey"" and ""sleazy"", you are making an implicit judgement that bestiality is perverted, sinful, disgusting, unnatural--in short, all the things that society once thought about homosexuality.  Not all people share your view.  You claim not to know any sincere zoophiles, but this does not mean that they do not exist.  They even have their own newsgroup:  alt.sex.bestiality.  Are you going to accuse them all of being mere ""jokers""?I notice you deleted the main point of my comment:  the fact that the only Biblical condemnations of bestiality occur in connection with the Levitical prohibitions against homosexuality.  While there are some New Testament passages that can arguably be taken as condemning homosexuality, there are none that condemn bestiality.  One of your main points seems to be that Christian homosexuality is acceptable due to the lack of any ""clear"" New Testament statements against it; if this is a valid argument, then should not Christian zoophilia be made that much more acceptable by the fact that the New Testament makes no reference, clear or unclear, to the subject at all?I am quite serious here.  If I am going to accept homosexuality as Biblically acceptable on the basis of your arguments, then I am going to be fair and apply the same standards to everyone else's declared sexual preferences as well.  If the arguments you make for homosexuality can be applied to other sexual preferences as well, I'm going to apply them and see what comes up.  I'm not trying to ""torpedo a serious issue"" by using what you label ""a ridiculous joke"".  I posted a question about how we should interpret Biblical guidelines for Christian sexuality, and I don't think such a question is ""irrelevant"" in a group called ""soc.religion.christian"".  The Bible discusses homosexuality and bestiality together in the same context, and therefore I feel I have a good precedent for doing the same.>Jesus and Paul both expound, very explictly and in considerable length,>the central linch-pin of Christian moral thought: we are required to>love one another, and ALL else depends on that.  Gay and lesbian Christ->ians challenge you to address the issue on those terms -- and all we get>in return are cheap debate tricks attempting to side-track the issues.I don't know whether it makes any difference, but for the record, this is not a side issue for me.  I believe loving one another includes not encouraging people to defile themselves, therefore it is of high importance to determine whether God regards certain sexual acts as defiling.  I can read in the New Testament that ""God has joined together"" heterosexual couples, and that the marriage bed is undefiled.  I can read in the Old Testament that homosexual intercourse and bestiality defile a person whether or not that person is under the Law.  If gay Christians can validly put aside the Old Testament standards of defilement, then I want to know so that I can fairly apply it to all the sexual practices that defiled a person in the old days.  I don't think it's right to take just bits and pieces of the Law and try and apply them to Christians today, e.g. bestiality still defiles you but homosexuality doesn't.  That was pretty much what you said earlier, right?  You used different examples, but I think you said essentially the same thing about it being wrong to apply only certain parts of the Law to Christians. >Christians, no doubt very sincere ones, keep showing up here and in every>corner of USENET and the world, and ALL they ever do is spout these same>old verses (which they obviously have never thought about, maybe never>even read), in TOTAL ignorance of the issues raised, slandering us with>the vilest charges of child abuse or whatever their perfervid minds can>manage to conjure up, tossing out red herrings with (they suppose) great>emotional force to cause readers to dismiss our witness without even>taking the trouble to find out what it is.It was not my intent to stir up such an emotional reaction.  I personally don't get all that upset discussing alternatives to the monogamous heterosexual orientation; I'm afraid I naively assumed that others would have a similar attitude.  Please note that I have never intended to equate homosexuality with child abuse.  I have merely noted that, for all the lack of ""clear"" NT condemnation of homosexuality, there is an even greater lack of NT condemnation (or even mention) of bestiality, a practice which a number of people (e.g. on alt.sex.bestiality) consider to be their true sexual orientation.>Such behavior should shame anyone who claims to have seen Truth in Christ.>WHY, for God's precious sake, do you people quote irrelevant verses to>condemn people you don't know and won't even take the trouble to LISTEN>to BEFORE you start your condemnations?  Is that loving your neighbor?>God forbid!  Is THAT how you obey the repeated commands to NOT judge or>condemn others?  Christ and Paul spend ORDERS OF MAGNITUDE more time in>insisting on this than the half-dozen obscure words in Paul that you are>SO bloody ready to take as license to do what God tells you NOT to do.> >Why, for God's sake?> [quote from John 3:17ff omitted for brevity]This is an excellent question, and I pray that you will not treat it as a mere rhetorical question, but will genuinely seek to discover and understand the answer.  I recommend you begin with a little introspection into why you yourself have much the same attitude towards zoophilia.  Why do you find bestiality so repugnant that you regard it as slanderous to even mention in connection with other alternative sexual orientations?  Why do you not apply all the same verses about love and tolerance to zoophiles the way you apply them to homosexuals?Is it because you automatically experience a subjective feeling of revulsion at the thought?  A lot of people have the same experience at the thought of homosexual intercourse.  Is it because you regard the practice as socially unacceptable?  A lot of people regard homosexuality as socially unacceptable.  Do you feel that it violates the traditional Judeo-Christian standard of sexual morality?  Many people feel that homosexuality does.  Do you feel the Bible condemns it?  Many people think the Bible says more to condemn homosexuality than it does to condemn bestiality.  Why then do you think comparing bestiality with homosexuality is insulting to homosexuality?  If you can honestly answer this question, you will have come a long way towards understanding why many people feel the same way about homosexuality as you feel about bestiality.Also please note that I am not in any sense condemning *people*.  I am merely pointing out that when I read the Bible I see certain sexual *practices* that the Bible appears to condemn, e.g. sex outside of marriage.  When I say I think adultery and pre-marital sex are sinful, do you take that as me failing to love my neighbor?  When you treat bestiality as something disgusting and unmentionable, are you disobeying ""repeated orders not to judge or condemn others""?  When you say other Christians are guilty of sinning by condemning you and judging you, are you by that accusation making yourself guilty of the same offense?  Or are you and I both simply taking note about *practices* the Bible brands as sinful, and leaving the judgement of the *people* up to God?>For long ages, we (many of us) have been confused by evil counsel from>evil men and told that if we came to the light we would be shamed and>rejected.  Some of us despaired and took to courses that probably *do*>show a sinful shunning of God's light.  Blessed are those whose spirits>have been crushed by the self-righteous; they shall be justified.>>However, we have seen the Truth, and the Truth is the light of humanity;>and we now know that it is not WE who fear the light, but our enemies who>fear the light of our witness and will do everything they can to shadow>it with the darkness of false witness against us.>-- >Michael L. Siemon               I say ""You are gods, sons of the>mls@panix.com                   Most High, all of you; nevertheless>    - or -                      you shall die like men, and fall>mls@ulysses.att..com            like any prince.""   Psalm 82:6-7I'm not sure what you mean by the above two paragraphs.  If you mean that Jesus is the Truth, and that He accepts sinners, and does not reject them, then I agree.  If we were not sinners, then we would not *need* a Savior.  Our salvation in Christ, however, does not mean that sin is now irrelevant for us, and we can now do whatever we want.  Nor does Christ's grace mean that those who refer to sin as ""sin"" are being judgemental or intolerant.  I am speaking in general terms here, not specifically about homosexuality.  If the Bible calls something ""sin"", then it is not unreasonable for Christians to call it sin too.As applied to Christian homosexuality, I think the only definitive authority on Christian sexuality is the Bible.  If you make a list of everything the Bible says on the subject of homosexual intercourse, I think you will find that every verse on the list is negative and condemning at worst, and ""unclear"" at best.  The most pro-gay statement you could make about the list is that there is some dispute about the New Testament verses which many people interpret as condemning homosexual intercourse.  That is, from a gay perspective, the most positive thing you can say about the Bible's treatment of homosexuality is that some verses fail to clearly condemn it.  That's it.  Jesus declared all foods clean, the council at Jerusalem declared that Gentiles were not required to keep the ritual Law, but nobody ever reclassified homosexual intercourse from being an abomination deserving of death to being an accepted Christian practice.  You have verses describing homosexual intercourse as an abomination that defiles both Jews under the Law and Gentiles not under the Law, and you have some verses which are at best ""not clear"" but which some people believe *are* clear in their condemnation of homosexual behavior, and that's the sum total of what the Bible says about same-sex intercourse.I can appreciate (from personal experience) your desire to have everything simple, cut-and-dried, black-and-white, what-I-want- is-ok, and those-who-oppose-me-are-wicked.  However, I do not think the Bible makes your case as definitively as you would like it to.  In fact, I don't believe it says anything positive about your case at all.  Yes, I know the verses about loving one another, and not judging one another, but that's not really the issue, is it?  You know and admit that there are still things that are sinful for Christians to do, since you say it is wrong for Christians to condemn you.  Therefore, the issue is whether the Bible says homosexual intercourse is a sin.  Even if you do challenge the clarity of the New Testament verses, you are still left with the fact that the only thing the Bible does say clearly about homosexual intercourse is that it is an abomination that defiles both those who are under the law and those who are not.- Mark[Actually I don't think the reaction to the comparision withbestiality is based on bestialophobia.  I think what he regards asslimey is the rhetorical approach of connecting homosexuality andbestiality.  Most people who accept homosexuality take a radicalapproach to the Law.  They regard all of Lev as not binding onChristians.  The argument is that there's no way in the text toseparate bestiality, homosexuality, and wearing mixed fabrics.  Thisdoes not mean that such people have no limits on their conduct, nordoes it mean that they accept bestiality.  It simply means that theirsexual ethics does not come from the Law, and particularly not fromLev.  --clh]"	soc.religion.christian

Youcould be right, but it sounds plausible to me.  Is there anyreason that you dismiss it out-of-hand?  Here's some more:   Recent scholarship has shown that in the mid-1700s Indians were not   only invited to participate in the deliberations of our ""founding   fathers,"" but that the Great Binding Law of the Iroquois Confederacy   arguably became the single most important model for the 1754 Albany   Plan of Union, and later the Articles of Confederation and the   Constitution.  That this would be absent from our school texts,   and from history, and from media is not surprising given the devotion   Americans feel to our founding myth: Great men gathered to express   a new vision that has withstood the test of time.  If it were   revealed that Indians had a role in it, imagine the blow to the   American psyche.   ...      By 1754, when most of these men and others gathered to creat the   Albany Plan of Union, the first try at confederation, they invited   forty-two members of the Iroquois Grand Council to serve as advisors   on confederate structures.  Benjamin Franklin freely acknowledged   his interest in the Iroquois achievement in a famous speech at   Albany Congress: ""It would be a strange thing...if six nations   of ignorant savages[sic] should be capable of forming such a union   and be able to execute it in such a manner that it has subsisted   for ages and appears indissoluble, and yet that a like union should   be impractical for ten or a dozen English colonies.""      According to Grinde, Franklin convened meetings of Iroquois chiefs   and congressional delegates in order to ""hammer out a plan that he   acknowedged to be similar to the Iroquois Confederacy.""Grinde is Professor Donald Grinde,Jr., of the University of Californiaat Riverside whose book _The Iroquois and the Founding Fathers of theAmerican Nation_ addresses this issue.--Doug Graham         dgraham@bnr.ca         My opinions are my own."	alt.atheism

The parts aremostly independent, but you should read the first part before the rest.We don't have the time to send out missing parts by mail, so don't ask.Notes such as ``[KAH67]'' refer to the reference list in the last part.The sections of this FAQ are available via anonymous FTP to rtfm.mit.edu as /pub/usenet/news.answers/cryptography-faq/part[xx].  The Cryptography FAQ is posted to the newsgroups sci.crypt, sci.answers, and news.answersevery 21 days.Contents:* What is a one-way hash function?* What is the difference between public, private, secret, shared, etc.?* What are MD4 and MD5?* What is Snefru?* What is a one-way hash function?  A typical one-way hash function takes a variable-length message and  produces a fixed-length hash. Given the hash it is computationally  impossible to find a message with that hash; in fact one can't  determine any usable information about a message with that hash, not  even a single bit. For some one-way hash functions it's also  computationally impossible to determine two messages which produce the  same hash.  A one-way hash function can be private or public, just like an  encryption function. Here's one application of a public one-way hash  function, like MD5 or Snefru. Most public-key signature systems are  relatively slow. To sign a long message may take longer than the user  is willing to wait. Solution: Compute the one-way hash of the message,  and sign the hash, which is short. Now anyone who wants to verify the  signature can do the same thing.  Another name for one-way hash function is message digest function.* What is the difference between public, private, secret, shared, etc.?  There is a horrendous mishmash of terminology in the literature for a  very small set of concepts. When an algorithm depends on a key which  isn't published, we call it a private algorithm; otherwise we call it  a public algorithm. We have encryption functions E and decryption  functions D, so that D(E(M)) = M for any message M. We also have  hashing functions H and verification functions V, such that V(M,X) = 1  if and only if X = H(M).  A public-key cryptosystem has public encryption and private  decryption. Checksums, such as the application mentioned in the  previous question, have public hashing and public verification.  Digital signature functions have private hashing and public  verification: only one person can produce the hash for a message,  but everyone can verify that the hash is correct.  Obviously, when an algorithm depends on a private key, it's meant to  be unusable by anyone who doesn't have the key. There's no real  difference between a ``shared'' key and a private key: a shared key  isn't published, so it's private. If you encrypt data for a friend  rather than ``for your eyes only'', are you suddenly doing  ``shared-key encryption'' rather than private-key encryption? No.* What are MD4 and MD5?  MD4 and MD5 are message digest functions developed by Ron Rivest.  Definitions appear in RFC 1320 and RFC 1321 (see part 10). Code is  available from [FTPMD].  Note that a transcription error was found in the original MD5 draft  RFC. The corrected algorithm should be called MD5a, though some  people refer to it as MD5.* What is Snefru?  Snefru is a family of message digest functions developed by Ralph  Merkle. Snefru-8 is an 8-round function, the newest in the family.  Definitions appear in Merkle's paper [ME91a]. Code is available from  [FTPSF].	sci.crypt

We use it toproduce a variety of educational materials for disemination on our localnetwork.  Because this programming is going to be viewed on other Macs, theimage quality is not as important as the ability to directly export thevideo to the Net.We also use it to produce orientiation and promotional video programs foruse by the Lewis & Clark community.  Since these programs are not meant forcommercial or broadcast use, image quality is not critical.The Digital Film system, for those of you who are uninitiated, is an A/B rolldigitizing system on one $5000 JPEG compression card.  It was promoted asan inexpensive online editing system with SVHS quality.  SuperMac, the makerof the card, is trying to achieve this quality level, but as yet, has beenunable to deliver.  Our system produces ""near VHS"" quality at 30 fields persecond (640x480 overscan).  The card repeats every other field to get 60fields per second.  This results in a kind of Super 8 film look that somefind distracting.If you can get past this problem, you'll find the Adobe Premier editing software quite enjoyable with which to work.  It produces thousands ofdifferent effects from crystalize filters to DVE transitions to color matting.Because of its non-linear nature, editing is fast and easy.  If you've everused (or seen used) an AVID or Montage system, you'll recognize the methodologyand the user interface.The total system with Quadra 950 (40Megs of RAM), 1 gig drive, 21"" Apple mon-itor, Panasonic SVHS 1960 edit deck, audio gear (cassette, CD, EQ, mixer, etc),Composite monitor, Digital Film card will set you back about $20,000.For you video cowboys and girls, this system will not output at a qualitythat will satisfy most of your clients.

The primary U.S. objection is ``Iran's international behaviour''which includes ``extending support of violence'' to disrupt the ArabIsraeli peace process and its rapid build-up of dangerous weapons.	Mack said ``Iran could contribute to regional stability and peace butfirst it is to end the behaviour which threatens this area.''	Mack spoke at the U.S.-GCC business conference aimed at promotingGulf-American trade. He said the ``Middle East will be an item very highon the agenda of the U.S. administration.''	The importance of the Gulf is underlined by Secretary of State WarrenChristoper's visit last year to Saudi Arabia and Kuwait before anywhereelse in the world, Mack said. He added that the U.S. has no long-termplan to station troops in the Gulf.	Mack also insisted that the Clinton administration will continue topressure Iraq to ``comply with all the U.N.

"Newsgroup:sci.spacedocument_id: 61172From: jbh55289@uxa.cso.uiuc.edu (Josh Hopkins)Subject: DC-Y trajectory simulationI've been to three talks in the last month which might be of interest. I've transcribed some of my notes below.  Since my note taking ability is by no meansinfallible, please assume that all factual errors are mine.  Permission is granted to copy this without restriction.Note for newbies:  The Delta Clipper project is geared towards producing asingle staget to orbit, reusable launch vehicle.  The DC-X vehicle is a 1/3scale vehicle designed to test some of the concepts invovled in SSTO.  It is currently undergoing tests.  The DC-Y vehicle would be a full scale experimental vehicle capable of reaching orbit.  It has not yet been funded.On April 6th, Rocky Nelson of MacDonnell Douglas gave a talk entitled ""Optimizing Techniques for Advanced Space Missions"" here at the University ofIllinois. Mr Nelson's job involves using software to simulate trajectories anddetermine the optimal trajectory within given requirements.  Although he isnot directly involved with the Delta Clipper project, he has spent time with them recently, using his software for their applications.  He thus used the DC-Y project for most of his examples.  While I don't think the detailsof implicit trajectory simulation are of much interest to the readers (I hopethey aren't - I fell asleep during that part), I think that many of you willbe interested in some of the details gleaned from the examples.The first example given was the maximization of payload for a polar orbit.  Themain restriction is that acceleration must remain below 3 Gs.  I assume thatthis is driven by passenger constraints rather than hardware constraints, but Idid not verify that.  The Delta Clipper Y version has 8 engines - 4 boostersand 4 sustainers.  The boosters, which have a lower isp, are shut down in mid-flight.  Thus, one critical question is when to shut them down.  Mr Nelsonshowed the following plot of acceleration vs time:                  ______3 G         /|   /      |           / |  /       |          As ASCII graphs go, this is actually fairly           /  | /        |	   good.  The big difference is that the lines2 G      /   |/         |          made by the  /  should be curves which are        /               |          concave up.  The data is only approximate, as       /                |          the graph wasn't up for very long.1 G   /                 |                        |                        |0 G                     |             ^          ^           ~100 sec    ~400 secAs mentioned before, a critical constraint is that G levels must be kept below3.  Initially, all eight engines are started.  As the vehicle  burns fuel theaccelleration increases.  As it gets close to 3G, the booster engines are throtled back.  However, they quickly become inefficient at low power, so itsoon makes more sense to cut them off altogether.  This causes the dip in accelleration at about 100 seconds.  Eventually the remaining sustainer enginesbring the G level back up to about 3 and then hold it there until they cutout entirely.The engine cutoff does not acutally occur in orbit.  The trajectory is aimedfor an altitude slightly higher than the 100nm desired and the last vestiges ofair drag slow the vehicle slightly, thus lowering the final altitude to that desired.Questions from the audience:  (paraphrased)Q:  Would it make sense to shut down the booster engines in pairs, rather than    all at once?A:  Very perceptive.  Worth considering.  They have not yet done the simulation.    Shutting down all four was part of the problem as given.Q:  So what was the final payload for this trajectory?A:  Can't tell us.  ""Read Aviation Leak.""  He also apparently had a good     propulsion example, but was told not to use it.  My question:  Does anyone know if this security is due to SDIO protectingnational security or MD protecting their own interests?The second example was reentry simulation, from orbit to just before the pitchup maneuver.  The biggest constraint in this one is aerodynamic heating, and the parameter they were trying to maximize was crossrange.  He showed graphsof heating using two different models, to show that both were very similar,and I think we were supposed to assume that this meant they were very accurate.The end result was that for a polar orbit landing at KSC, the DC-Y would haveabout 30 degrees of crossrange and would start it's reentry profile about 60 degrees south latitude.I would have asked about the landing maneuvers, but he didn't know about thataspect of the flight profile.-- Josh Hopkins                                          jbh55289@uxa.cso.uiuc.edu		    ""Find a way or make one.""	             -attributed to Hannibal"	sci.space

The documents, including handwritten notes by Himmler, areamong the best evidence that exists to rebut claims that theHolocaust is a myth, archivists say.	""The notes give them their authenticity,"" said Robert Wolfe,a supervisory archivist for captured German records.  ""He wassupposed to destroy them.  Like a lot of bosses, he didn't obey hisown rules.""	The documents, moved out of Berlin to what Himmler hopedwould be a safe hiding place, were recovered by Allied forces afterWorld War II from a salt mine near Salzburg, Austria.	Himmler spoke on Oct.4, 1943, in Posen, Poland, to more than100 German secret police generals.  ""I also want to talk to you,quite frankly, on a very grave matter.  Among ourselves it should bementioned quite frankly, and yet we will never speak of it publicly.I mean the clearing out of the Jew, the extermination of the Jewishrace.  This is a page of GLORY in our history which has never beenwritten and is never to be written.""  [Emphasis mine--rje]	The German word Himmler uses that is translated as""extermination"" is *Ausrottung*.	Wolfe said a more precise translation would be ""extirpation""or ""tearing up by the roots.""	In his handwritten notes, Himmler used a euphemism,""Judenevakuierung"" or ""evacuation of the Jews.""  But archivesofficials said ""extermination"" is the word he actuallyspoke--preserved on an audiotape in the archives.	Himmler, who oversaw Adolf Hitler's ""final solution of theJewish question,"" committed suicide after he was arrested in 1945.	The National Archives exhibit, on display through May 16, isa preview of the opening of the United States Holocaust MemorialMuseum here on April 26.

The dear old aunt (now deceased) was very proud of her Jewish heritage, although not especiallydevout.

I went, not knowing really what toexpect, other than stimulating conversation and fellowship.  What I got,however, was rather unexpected.  The thrust of the evening's discussionwas to condemn the Reagan-Bush policies prohibiting abortion counseling in federally funded family planning clinics, prohibiting the sterilizationof minorities on welfare here and in Puerto Rico, onthe ban on fetal tissue research, and against the Mexico City policy,""which denies U.S. foreign aid to programs overseas that promote abortion.""The crux of their position was to place the blame for the problems of""overpopulation,"" rampant domestic crime, African starvation, unwedmothers, etc., on Christianity, rather on the fall of Adam.  Now, thisis not what I had to come to talk about.  But every time I tried to bring up the subject of Judaism, they would condemn Jews for Jesusand admonish me against converting to Judaism, ""because it involvestoo much study and effort.""  And I did not even raise the prospect, nortry to convert them to the truth of Christ!  There was certainly noJewish proselytism going on there.And again, last November I toured a ""traditional"" Jewish synagogue and wassubjected to a 30-minute harangue against Jesus and Christianity ingeneral.  I realize that these are two isolated incidents, and that thebest supervisor I ever had at work is Jewish, but from my experience,the modern Jew is not known for his proselytism. -- boundaryno teneis que pensar que yo haya venido a traer la paz a la tierra; no hevenido a traer la paz, sino la guerra (Mateo 10:34, Vulgata Latina)"	soc.religion.christian

As usual, Sahl's was independent and sharp as a scalpel.	My effort can only dream of comparing favorably to Mort's. At least it has a fairly popular orginating premise; everyone I'd mention the idea to thought it was either divinely inspired or at least past due for delivery.	Those reactions are based on parallels that should be obvious to the most peripheral observer of the Acts of those False Prophets. Both are noted for their galvanizing oratorical skills, which they both used with passion to generate a political cult of massive numerical proportions (in fact, Limbaugh claims to have an audience of just over 12 million, almost identical to the number of votes cast for Hitler in the April 1932 German election). Both used a myopic social perspective to build the cult, and enthusiastically amputated facts from the record to fabricate their ideological quilt.	The last point is glaringly documented by passages in the opening pages of both books. Hitler's example is when, on page 5, he claims the German nationalist terrorist Leo Schlageter (he bombed part of a railway line between Dusseldorf and Duisburg, being caught in the act, in 1923) was ""betrayed to France by a representative of his government"" when there has never been any factual foundation for such a statement.	In fact, the governments of both the Reich and Prussia, as well as the Vatican, actively intervened to save him from execution, and almost succeeded. Limbaugh follows suit by making the hysterically sarcastic claim in his introduction that ""in a school or during a commencement ceremony or many other public places... God is unconstitutional."" Of course, it's not God but the official imposition of particular concepts of God against an individual's will that's unconstitutional. But Limbaugh is too gleeful in his talent for distortion to want you to know that.	Of course, one would assume that, by comparing the two books, my main point would be that The Way Things Ought to Be is the modern American Mein Kampf. Not really. At the time of the first German version of Mein Kampf, Hitler was just four months out of prison (June, 1925), and trying to reorganize the Nazis. He used the book to build his dozen million followers. Limbaugh, on the other hand, came up with his book after building his dozen million. Twelve million went a longer way in Weimar Germany that it does in the Republicrat United States.	Thus, the more accurate parallels would be that Limbaugh's daily three-hour radio show is the American Mein Kampf, the primary propoganda tool used to pump up the angry volume; and that The Way Things Ought to Be is actually the American Triumph of the Will, a translation of the same fascist message into a different medium. Also, the printed word was the more important medium in Weimar Germany, since radio was still being thought of by impoverished Germans as a medium of luxury in 1925. Today, on the other hand, Americans are more likely to spend a few seconds to tune a radio dial at no monetary charge than drop $22 for 304 pages of transcripts of the same words.	But, as Mort Sahl also observed on the radio the other night, some cloutmeister of the radical right wants Limbaugh to be a focal point of their propoganda. (And remember, Sahl is an Al Haig conservative these days.)	Mort might not know exactly who Rush's equivalent of Rodolf Hess is (the book itself suggests Ed McLaughlin, the former president of ABC radio and now Limbaugh's partner in EFM Media, the radio program's production company). But Mort himself is a veteran of the talk show, having hosted them in New York, Washington and Los Angeles. He knows what evil lurks in the hearts of major market media men. He knows that Limbaugh could not have collected his audience had not the opportunity been placed on a silver platter and handed to him. Limbaugh earns his money just as honestly as Al Capone did; it's almost worthy of a RICO indictment.	On questions of social issues, there is an overabundance of material in the Limbaugh book that seems to echo Hitler's venom. For example:On Their Own Qualifications to Control Society	Hitler: ""Out of the host of sometimes millions of people, who individually more or less clearly and distinctly guess the truth, partly perhaps understand it, one man [author's emphasis] must step forward in order to form, with apodeictic force, out of the wavering world of imagination of the great masses, granite principles, and to take up the fight for their sole correctness, until out of the playing waves of a free world of thought a brazen rock of uniform combination of form and will arises"" (page 577).	Limbaugh: ""Who needs the media when they've got me? ... The show is devoted exclusively to what I think ... [the phrase ""with half my brain tied behind my back to make it even""] denotes the egress of mental aptitude I require to engage and demolish liberals and others who disagree with me ... It might take four or five years, but I'm convinced The Media will slowly and reluctantly come around to my way of thinking, kicking and screaming all the way."" (pages 266, 21, 299 and 273, respectively.)On Religion as the Basis of a Nation	Hitler: ""In this world human culture and civilization are inseperably bound up with the existence of the Aryan. His dying-off or his decline would again lower upon this earth the dark veils of a time without culture ... He who dares to lay hand upon the highest image of the Lord sins against the benevolent Creator of this miracle and helps in the expulsion from Paradise."" (Page 581.)	Limbaugh: ""America was founded as a Judeo-Christian country ... But our intellectual and political elites are often either hostile or ambivalent toward religion ... People for whom belief in God is at best a charming superstition have managed to ban prayer from the public schools for the last thirty years. Is it only a coincidence that the quality of American education has declined ever since?"" (pages 274-5.)On Popular Culture as a Reason for Social Collapse	Hitler: ""The fight against the poisoning of the soul has to set in ... One has only to look at the menus of our movie houses, vaudevilles and theatres; and one can hardly deny that this is not the right kind of food ... Theatre, art, literature, movies, the press, billposters and window displays must be cleaned of the symptoms of a rotting world and put into the service of a moral idea of State and culture."" (pages 346 and 348.)	Limbaugh: ""Today, Hollywood is in trouble. The reason [is] that Hollywood has forgotten who its audience is ... They make fun of people who believe in God. They ridicule the traditional family, heterosexuality and monagamy. They disparage American heroes."" (page 254.)On the News Meida	Hitler: ""The activity of the so-called liberal press was the work of gravediggers for the German people and the German Reich. One can pass by in silence the Marxist papers of lies ... it's task is only to break the people's folkish and national spine, in order to make it ripe for the yoke of slavery of international capital and its masters, the Jews."" (Page 331.)	Limbaugh: ""Elements of The Media have jumped on the bandwagon of leftist causes. The cynical journalist of the past has been replaced in many cases by an enthusiastic cheerleader for causes ... During the Gulf war, CNN correspondent Bernard Shaw [said] CNN is a global network. We can't take sides. Cant take sides? --- --- ---! ... If they don't realize that their freedom lies in the United States of America and that therefore they should defend this nation, they are hopelessly misguided and, may I suggest, flirting with megalomania."" (pages 270 and 268.)*     *     *	To continue these comparative excerpts is certainly possible, but ultimately too depressing to take in one reading.	After putting these books down, there is one undeniable fact that haunts me. In the 1920s, Adolf Hitler fed depressed and frightened Germans the opiate of hatred of those around them; in turn, it allowed Germans to hand their collective national power to the Nazis. In the 1990s, Rush Limbaugh is doing the very same thing: distributing hatred to depressed and frightened Americans; in turn, it is helping the American radical right to maintain its power base as the 12-year nightmare of the Reagan-Bush era comes to an end, hoping to rebuild it into their hopes for The Fascist States of America.	And if Limbaugh is not as repellant a Hitler, it is only because the radical right utilizes Limbaugh as its own gateway opiate. One can only wonder what the ultimate drug is they plan to hook America on.The Madison Edge can be reached at PO Box 845, Madison, WI 53701-0845; (608) 255-4460.--- 30 ---"	talk.politics.misc

Perhaps you heard aboutanti-trust in the business world.Since we are debating the legality of a commercialtransaction, we must use the laws governing the guidelinesand ethics of such transactions. Basic ANTI-TRUST law saysthat, while you can purchase IBM stocks for the purpose ofinvesting, you can not acquire a large number of thoseshares with the intent or controlling IBM. You can do soonly if you make your intentions CLEAR apriori . Clearly,the Jews who purchased properties from palastenians had somedesigns, they were not buying a dwelling or a real estate.They were establishing a bridgehead for the European Jews.The palastenians sold their properties to the Jews in theold tradition of arab hospitality. Being a multi-ethnic /multi-religious society, accepting the jews as neighbourswas no different, just another religion. Plus they paid fairmarket value, etc... They did not know they were victims ofan international conspiracy.

If he didn't help us win the AL east, forgetabout the pennent and the world series.His run support was high (5.98 runs) but so was Stottlemyer's (5.90 runs)and he won only 12 games.  I do remember Morris winning an inordinate number of6-5 and 8-6 ballgames, but this is to his credit.  He pitched only as goodas he needed to be.  When he was up 6-1 in a ballgame, he just put it in cruisecontrol and threw the ball up there and let the batters ""get themseleves out""(I hate this expression!).  An inexperienced pitcher would wear himself out trying to make perfect pitches to keep his era down.  But Morris, being a veteran pitcher, knows that winning is the only thing that really matters inbaseball.  By saving himself, he was able to reach back for that little extra(I hate this too!) when the game was on the line.Yes Morris is crapping out big time this year, but let's not change historyto suit the present.  BTW, I think he should be put in the bullpen; it would be embarrassing a veteran pitcher which Cito would never do, but his era is 17+, how much morecan he be embarrassed?> > From where I sit, I'll let others have the excellent players - I'll> settle for good enough and the ring :-)ditto!> > Joe Leonard> jle@world.std.com> eddie"	rec.sport.baseball

The word that is missing in this whole discourse is not the ""B""word, or the ""H"" word, or even the ""N"" or ""W"" words. It is the ""L"" word -LOSER !!	That's right. When we boil all the crap out of this argument, itis all about WINNING and LOSING, and nothing else. Let me explain.	Remember the eighties ? No excuses. Nobody who can handle a mailbuffer can claim they are ""too young"" to remember Ronald Reagan - yet.The eighties were about ""How America Learned to Win Once Again"". Then(wouldn't you know), we won so well that there was nothing left to win.No Cold War to endure. No nuclear holocaust. No more worlds to conquer(We forgot about outer space long ago). The kind of overwhelming, noholds barred success that killed Alexander the Great. Yes, there were afew ""little"" problems along the way - stock market meltdown here, anS&L bailout there, a few revolts and crazy Middle Eastern dictators tocontend with, but as Tacitus would tell ya', the God Augustus never hadit so good. 	In the meantime, there is guilt for winning, maybe a fear that onedoesn't deserve one's bounty - or success. So there is a ""kinder and gentlertype of politician these days, Bill Clinton, affirmative action, and lots ofdiscourse about people who ""don't get it"". For those of us in the winningbusiness, this kind of talk is mildly irritating, but there is still no suggestion of losing.	But what do we find now ? To put it mildy, the stereotype of our ""white male"" non-winner is Woody Hayes in the Rose Bowl, punching out photojournalists when those California fruits and nuts steal another onewith a ""Hail Mary"" pass in the Fourth Quarter. (The whole idea behind 'threeyards and a cloud of dust' is to wear your opponent down until he collapsesin the final period) But Woody just used his fists - Uzzies seem to be the weapon of choice these days. 		Who is D-FENS, anyway ? The answer is as plain as the horn rims on your face. The guy is MICHAEL DOUGLAS, posing as a LOSER. This is known as controversial casting. But that baggy short-sleeved white shirt sure does look natural on Mike doesn't it. Gordon Gekko will never look the same. (Though Woody always dressed that way.) Did we really expect Gekko to take it easy and enjoy that kind of wardrobe, without putting up a fuss ?	What we are starting to lose sight of is, that bashing D-FENS is the same game as bashing that poor African American slug that Clint Eastwoodused to blow away all the time. As that arch-WASP (male gender) George C. Scottdeclaimed, ""Americans traditionally LOVE TO WIN. They love a winner, and will not tolerate a loser."" And so on. 	The political implications are simple. If, as many socialists - andDemocrats - do, you consider society a finite pie to a apportioned in some ""equitable"" way, then you have to worry about who is a winner and who is a loser to tell whose side you are on. That could be black women today, Asianhomosexuals tommorrow, and yes indeed, white men some yet to be determinedday when the balance of the pie has finally swung against that (39%) minority.	Or you can just blow the whole thing off and say - as do mostconservatives and all the libertarians - and act is if you didn't carewho's winning and who's losing. In some cases, you might say somethingabout make sure the game is fair (equality of opportunity, not of condition).In the latter case, you might be able to identify yourself as a ""neoconservative"" or a ""neoliberal"" depending on how much you want to limitthe pot.	Either way you go, the way of the Winner is no longer the way to bepopular - at least after you graduate from High School (but you'll stillbe popular at High School reunions). But it beats being a Nerd, as I would imagine Michael Douglas would now agree, and in the long run, itis the only way to go. (Even in Hollywood, which treats Losers worse than anyother place in America except for New York and Washington, D.C. - and even inColumbus, Ohio, which produced Alex Keaton, but no champion football teams inthe eighties and the first quarter of the nineties) I'd like to see more Winners in this society, regardless of race, gender, religious preference, and sexual orientation. Maybe we should even let a few more of them be white men !! (We should DEFINITELY let the Buckeyes win the Rose Bowlsomeday)Bill R.--""The only proposals in the Senate that I         ""My opinions do not representhave seen fit to mention are particularly        those of my employer orpraiseworthy or particularly scandalous ones.    any government agency.""It seems to me that the historian's foremost     - Bill Riggsduty is to ensure that virtue is remembered,and to deter evil words and deeds with thefear of posterity's damnation.""- Tacitus, _Annals_ III. 65"	talk.politics.misc

While they had been considered a possible contender when JacquesDemers first arrived, in his last two years they were, respectively,embarrassed in the first round by Chicago, and then failed to make the playoffs (at a time, a might add, when there were only five teams in theNorris).It's true that Vancouver did not make the playoffs for many a year before Quinn came, but in those years the Smythe Division was a lot--I mean *a lot*--tougher division than the Norris, also known as the ""Snorris"", division.Vancouver had to play Edmonton and Calgary, both very legitimate StanleyCup contenders, eight times a year, while Detroit got to play such powerhouses as Toronto and Minnesota.  Now, Edmonton is hardly even a forcein the league, and the Smythe even has the mighty San Jose sharks, whileover this same period of time in which Vancouver was improving, so was everybody in the Norris (except St. Louis).

They had to improve *alot* to get better than their competition in the Norris.Bryan Murray inherited a team with very little talent.

Therest were either very green rookies or washed up veterans.

Figure.>John Stafford   Sure you can do wheelies with a shaft drive bike. I had a BMW R100RSthat was a wheelie monster! Of course it didn't have the initial powerburst to just twist it into the air - I had to pop the clutch. I alsohad to replace front fork seals a few times as well. The fairing is a bit heavy to be slamming down onto those little stantion tubes all thetime. But let me give you fair warning: I trashed the ring/pinion gearin the final drive of my K75 (I assume) doing wheelies. And this was NO cheap fix either!! There is some kind of ""slip"" device in the shaftto prevent IT from breaking. Unfortunately, it didn't save the gears!  On the topic of wheelies, the other day I saw a kid on a big Hurricanedo a ""stoppy""(?), or rear wheelie. Man, he had the rear end on this bike up about 2 feet off the ground at a traffic light. I don't recommend theseactivities anymore (now that I'm an ""old guy"" with kids of my own) butit looked damn impressive!!  If you can't keep both tires on the ground, at least have 'em pointedin that direction! :-)Cheers, B**2"	rec.motorcycles

From: FACN34B@SAUPM00.BITNET (zane of dhahan)>Newsgroups: bit.listserv.christiaSubject: Christianity in CrisisDate: Wed May 12 14:43:19 1993 ""Frank, first of all, thanks for all of the great Scripture verses.  Itwas a pleasure to read them."" MY REPLY...You are welcome, Zane. Zane...""I am sure nothing that I will say will change your mind about it... but Iwould like to ask you if the book in question really does anything for you.I mean, were you all caught up in the word/faith thing, but now that youhave read the book you've been rescued from all of the error and pain thatwill result in your Christian life?"" MY REPLY...(1) When I first became a Christian, I entered into the Word/Faith    movement.  It was easy.  I wasn't grounded in the Word of God and sound    doctrine.  When I visited Christian book stores, the cheapest books I    could find to buy were the .50 and $1.00 books by Hagin and others.    Consequently, I began receiving Hagin's monthly magazine (and they    still send it to me), and also Copeland's (also, still sent to me).    It wasn't until I read a booklet by Jimmy Swaggart called _Hyper Faith:    The New Gnosticism_ that I began to realize the teachings I were    partaking of were error.  I started reading the Bible more and studying    more.  Sure enough, Jimmy was right in many points.  As part of my    experience, I am alerting Christians, particularly new Christians, that    these teachings are heretical and they need to do as the Bereans did in    Acts 17:11 - check these teachings out with Scripture! (2) My brother in law was involved in a Word/Faith ""cult"" in my area - it's    leader is real good friends with Benny Hinn.  Rather then going into    much detail about this, suffice it to say he was deceived, mistreated, and    has now fallen into atheism.  I'm still praying for him (Phil. 1:6). (3) The assistant pastor at the church I teach adult Sunday School in has been    a `follower' of Copeland for 15 years.  He has thousands of tapes by the    Faith teachers.  In the class recently, I quoted several of the teachers'    heretical statements to his surprise.  Since then, I've been able to talk    to him at length about these issues. (4) The leader of the Women's Group at my church is a Benny Hinn `fan'.    Recently, I found that she has been lending _Good Morning, Holy Spirit_ to    women in the church.  That prompted my quotes in Sunday School, as well as    my lending CIC to people in the church. I'm well aware of the abuses and heresies perpetrated in this movement andhave an urgency in my heart and life to warn people about the heresies.What heresies?    A. Jesus became sin - took on the very nature of the devil, and became        one with him.    B. Jesus' death on the cross wasn't enough to atone.    C. Jesus was dragged to hell after His death, was beat and abused by        Satan and demons, thus finishing our atonement.  Satan was ruling        over Him there.    D. Jesus was `born-again' in hell.    E. Jesus died spiritually, lost His divinity, and reassumed it after        the resurrection.    F. We are gods. These are heresies.  Documentation will be provided re: these teachingsupon request. Zane...""Or what does it do for you?  Is it preventing you from going out andjoining up with the word/faith movement which you'd been contemplatingjoining for so long, but now that you've read the book, you've been savedfrom all of that?"" MY REPLY...It wasn't _Christianity In Crisis_ that helped me; it was a booklet bySwaggart that I mentioned above.  But CIC is MUCH, MUCH better - tremendousdocumentation and insights. Zane...""I don't have a nice Scriptural answer for why I believe it is at best un-profitable for Christians to engage in this type of activity - heresy hunting."" MY REPLY...Why do you call it ""heresy hunting""?  ""Hunting"" implies it isn't readilyaccessible or available.  This movement is the fastest growing movement inChristendom.  Hagin has sold over 40 million books and booklets.  Hinn has soldmore books in the last couple of years than Swindoll and Dobson combined.  FredPrice has the largest church in terms of seating capacity in the USA.  Doesn'tsound like much ""hunting"" is needed. It is Scriptural to expose doctrinal error.  I gave some verses to you before.More can be given.  Most of the epistles were written due to error (doctrinal,practical) in the churches.  The early church had numerous councils to exposeerror and heresy.  It's not a new thing.  Remember Luther? Zane...""I would like to point out though, that historically those who hunt hereticsoften end up causing a bigger mess than the heretics... but this is my un-documented opinion."" MY REPLY...(1) If you can provide documentation, it would be appreciated.(2) Read Ephesians 4:11-16, esp. vss. 13 and 14 and tell me what causes    disunity and immaturity in the body. EPH 4:13-14 till we all come to the unity of the faith and of the knowledge ofthe Son of God, to a perfect man, to the measure of the stature of the fullnessof Christ; that we should no longer be children, tossed to and fro and carriedabout with every wind of doctrine, by the trickery of men, in the cunningcraftiness of deceitful plotting.... Disunity, contrary to popular opinion, isn't caused by exposing error; it'scaused by error. Zane...""There are many who probably give no place for seeing the Scriptures asdocumenting a Spiritual development or growth in its writers - but I wouldsuggest that the fiery Paul of the letter to the Galatians mellows andmatures into the one who loses all for the sake of Love in the End."" MY REPLY...Most scholars believe Paul wrote 2 Timothy last.  Let's examine his admonitionsto Tim to ascertain how mellow he had become... 2TI 1:13-15 Hold fast the pattern of sound words which you have heard from me,in faith and love which are in Christ Jesus. That good thing which wascommitted to you, keep by the Holy Spirit who dwells in us. This you know, thatall those in Asia have turned away from me, among whom are Phygellus andHermogenes. 2TI 2:15-18 Be diligent to present yourself approved to God, a worker who doesnot need to be ashamed, rightly dividing the word of truth. But shun profaneand idle babblings, for they will increase to more ungodliness. And theirmessage will spread like cancer. Hymenaeus and Philetus are of this sort, whohave strayed concerning the truth, saying that the resurrection is alreadypast; and they overthrow the faith of some. 2TI 2:24-26 And a servant of the Lord must not quarrel but be gentle to all,able to teach, patient, in humility correcting those who are in opposition, ifGod perhaps will grant them repentance, so that they may know the truth, andthat they may come to their senses and escape the snare of the devil, havingbeen taken captive by him to do his will. 2TI 3:6-9 For of this sort are those who creep into households and makecaptives of gullible women loaded down with sins, led away by various lusts,always learning and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth. Now asJannes and Jambres resisted Moses, so do these also resist the truth: men ofcorrupt minds, disapproved concerning the faith; but they will progress nofurther, for their folly will be manifest to all, as theirs also was. 2TI 3:12-17 Yes, and all who desire to live godly in Christ Jesus will sufferpersecution. But evil men and impostors will grow worse and worse, deceivingand being deceived. But you must continue in the things which you have learnedand been assured of, knowing from whom you have learned them, and that fromchildhood you have known the Holy Scriptures, which are able to make you wisefor salvation through faith which is in Christ Jesus. All Scripture is given byinspiration of God, and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, forcorrection, for instruction in righteousness, that the man of God may becomplete, thoroughly equipped for every good work. 2TI 4:2-5 Preach the word! Be ready in season and out of season. Convince,rebuke, exhort, with all longsuffering and teaching. For the time will comewhen they will not endure sound doctrine, but according to their own desires,because they have itching ears, they will heap up for themselves teachers; andthey will turn their ears away from the truth, and be turned aside to fables.But you be watchful in all things, endure afflictions, do the work of anevangelist, fulfill your ministry. 2TI 4:14-15 Alexander the coppersmith did me much harm. May the Lord repay himaccording to his works. You also must beware of him, for he has greatlyresisted our words. Zane...""The picture I have of Paul is not of one who goes out of his way to destroythe ministry of wolves... but of one who teaches the sheep, with many tears,the necessity of absolutely not allowing themselves to be transformed intowolves to protect themselves."" MY REPLY...ACT 20:26-31 ""Therefore I testify to you this day that I am innocent of theblood of all men. ""For I have not shunned to declare to you the whole counselof God.

Zane...""For all the warning Paul does, it is of note that he never once drops a nameof a wolf....  - but I will admit he cries in his beard at the end over thosewho have abandoned him - everyone in Asia wasn't it ?"" MY REPLY...Paul mentioned names... 1TI 1:18-20 This charge I commit to you, son Timothy, according to theprophecies previously made concerning you, that by them you may wage the goodwarfare, having faith and a good conscience, which some having rejected,concerning the faith have suffered shipwreck, of whom are Hymenaeus andAlexander, whom I delivered to Satan that they may learn not to blaspheme. 2TI 1:15 This you know, that all those in Asia have turned away from me, amongwhom are Phygellus and Hermogenes. 2TI 2:16-18 But shun profane and idle babblings, for they will increase to moreungodliness. And their message will spread like cancer. Hymenaeus and Philetusare of this sort, who have strayed concerning the truth, saying that theresurrection is already past; and they overthrow the faith of some. 2TI 4:10 for Demas has forsaken me, having loved this present world, and hasdeparted for Thessalonica--Crescens for Galatia, Titus for Dalmatia. 2TI 4:14-15 Alexander the coppersmith did me much harm. May the Lord repay himaccording to his works. You also must beware of him, for he has greatlyresisted our words. So did John... 3JO 1:9-10 I wrote to the church, but Diotrephes, who loves to have thepreeminence among them, does not receive us. Therefore, if I come, I will callto mind his deeds which he does, prating against us with malicious words. Andnot content with that, he himself does not receive the brethren, and forbidsthose who wish to, putting them out of the church. Jesus also singled out teachings and doctrines... REV 2:14-16 ""But I have a few things against you, because you have there thosewho hold the doctrine of Balaam, who taught Balak to put a stumbling blockbefore the children of Israel, to eat things sacrificed to idols, and to commitsexual immorality. ""Thus you also have those who hold the doctrine of theNicolaitans, which thing I hate. 'Repent, or else I will come to you quicklyand will fight against them with the sword of My mouth. REV 2:20-23 ""Nevertheless I have a few things against you, because you allowthat woman Jezebel, who calls herself a prophetess, to teach and seduce Myservants to commit sexual immorality and eat things sacrificed to idols. ""And Igave her time to repent of her sexual immorality, and she did not repent.""Indeed I will cast her into a sickbed, and those who commit adultery with herinto great tribulation, unless they repent of their deeds. ""I will kill herchildren with death, and all the churches shall know that I am He who searchesthe minds and hearts. And I will give to each one of you according to yourworks. Zane...""I question too, the purposes of those who write books and build ministrieson the faults - deliberate or otherwise - of others.  Maybe if they wouldwander around in the desert eating locust and honey, or barely cakes...withno worldly goods at stake, money to be made, or no reputations to maintain...I would question their motives - conscious or otherwise - less."" MY REPLY...I won't comment on this because it deals with the intangible motives of others.But even if they had bad motives, remember what Paul said... PHI 1:15-18 Some indeed preach Christ even from envy and strife, and some alsofrom good will: The former preach Christ from selfish ambition, not sincerely,supposing to add affliction to my chains; but the latter out of love, knowingthat I am appointed for the defense of the gospel. What then? Only that inevery way, whether in pretense or in truth, Christ is preached; and in this Irejoice, yes, and will rejoice. Zane...""If we want to be true to the admonitions of Scripture - many of which youlist - about protecting ourselves and the flock from wolves and winds ofdoctrines, I suggest we start by allowing the wolf-program in our own noeticpasture to be nailed to the Cross."" MY REPLY...Please explain. Zane...""Secondly, I suggest any heresy hunting be restricted to our own fellowships -which in the strict Scriptural sense is the local city-church."" MY REPLY...If heresy was not being propagated over the mass media, then it may not beneeded to go mass media with the exposure.  Unfortunately, heresy is beingtaught not just in Copeland's church or Hagin's or Hinn's or Price's, but allover the radio, in print, etc.  No pastor or church leader knows what materialsthe sheep are feeding on outside the church.  It's imperative that leadershipbe made aware of this, and CIC does just that. Also, let's examine a passage of Scripture...* EPH 4:11 And He Himself gave some to be apostles, some prophets, someevangelists, and some pastors and teachers,* EPH 4:12 for the equipping of the saints for the work of ministry, for theedifying of the body of Christ, These ministry gifts that the Lord installs in the church are not just for oneindividual church, but for ""the body of Christ"".Paul was an apostle - he traveled all over distilling his message.  He was alsoa teacher -1CO 4:17 For this reason I have sent Timothy to you, who is my beloved andfaithful son in the Lord, who will remind you of my ways in Christ, as I teacheverywhere in every church.1CO 7:17 But as God has distributed to each one, as the Lord has called eachone, so let him walk. And so I ordain in all the churches. Also -1CO 12:28 And God has appointed these in the church: first apostles, secondprophets, third teachers, after that miracles, then gifts of healings, helps,administrations, varieties of tongues. * EPH 4:13 till we all come to the unity of the faith and of the knowledge ofthe Son of God, to a perfect man, to the measure of the stature of the fullnessof Christ; Notice that the ""Five-Fold"" ministries are going to be around ""till"" the churchis in ""unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the Son of God to a perfectman"".  This, I believe will not occur fully until the Lord Jesus returns (see1Cor. 13:9-12).  But God wants the body to continue on maturing.  What hindersmaturity and unity of the body? * EPH 4:14 that we should no longer be children, tossed to and fro and carriedabout with every wind of doctrine, by the trickery of men, in the cunningcraftiness of deceitful plotting, It's clear that false doctrine, integrated into the church ""by the trickery ofmen"" causes (1) disunity [the thing we are striving for] and (2) spiritualimmaturity - the church continues in spiritual childhood when Christians are""tossed to and fro and carried about with every wind of doctrine"". The ""Five -Fold"" ministry, of which there does not appear to be clearScriptural denominational boundaries (""pastors"" appear responsible for theirindividual flock), is to deal with these doctrines (when necessary) in theirstruggle to equip the body. All believers are called to do this to a degree...JUD 1:3-4 Beloved, while I was very diligent to write to you concerning ourcommon salvation, I found it necessary to write to you exhorting you to contendearnestly for the faith which was once for all delivered to the saints. Forcertain men have crept in unnoticed, who long ago were marked out for thiscondemnation, ungodly men, who turn the grace of our God into lewdness and denythe only Lord God and our Lord Jesus Christ. Zane...""If you'll notice, in Scripture the heresy hunters that went from Church toChurch and area to area, were the ""bad guys"" and they went after the ""good guy""namely Paul - who they considered to be the arch heretic."" MY REPLY...They were themselves heretics trying to discredit Paul who was preachingcontrary to what they taught! Zane...""Let's face it, the wolves are here for a reason.  And we are here for theReason.  And let's hope the wolves become sheep, and the sheep, lambs."" MY REPLY...Yes!2TI 2:24-26 And a servant of the Lord must not quarrel but be gentle to all,                                                           ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~able to teach, patient, in humility correcting those who are in opposition, if~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  ~~God perhaps will grant them repentance, so that they may know the truth, and~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~that they may come to their senses and escape the snare of the devil, havingbeen taken captive by him to do his will.

Like fuelfor re-entry, any kind of heat shielding, etc., etc.  Even still, if thecontest participants had to fund DC-1 development, it probably wouldn't beworth it to develop DC-1 (just for the contest).  Just give me the cheapestheaviest lift man rated (or at least under 6 or so Gs) booster...  If Idon't have to pay for DC-1 development, great!, I'll use it.But back to the contest goals, there was a recent article in AW&ST about alow cost (it's all relative...) manned return to the moon.  A GeneralDynamics scheme involving a Titan IV & Shuttle to lift a Centaur upperstage, LEV, and crew capsule.  The mission consists of delivering twounmanned payloads to the lunar surface, followed by a manned mission. Total cost:  US was $10-$13 billion.  Joint ESA(?)/NASA project was $6-$9billion for the US share.I didn't find a mention of how long the crew could stay, but I'd bet thatits  around 30 days.  And the total payload delivered was about 30 metrictonnes.  So if you ignore the scientific payload, hitch a ride in the crewhabitation module (no return trip...), and toss in a few more tonnes forthe additional consumables to last another 11 months, then you *might* beable to get a year visit out of 15 tonnes (and in case its not obvious,that's a wild ass guess).  A pretty boring visit, since every trip outdoorseats up a bit of LOX.  And I'm not certain if a home brewed (orcollege-brewed) life support system could last a year.  But let's roundthis up to 19.4 tonnes (convient, since the GD plan talks about 9.7 tonpayloads delivered to the lunar surface.  This adds up to two Centaurs, twoLEVs, two Shuttle flights... All to put a single man on the moon for ayear.   Hmmm.  Not really practical.  Anyone got a cheaper/better way ofdelivering 15-20 tonnes to the lunar surface within the decade?  Anyonehave a more precise guess about how much a year's supply of consumables andequipment would weigh?And I was wondering about the GD LEV.  Is it reusable?  Or is it discardedto burn up on return to LEO?  If its not discarded, could it be refueled? Henry: Do you know anything about the GD LEV?  I noted that it uses RL-10engines.  Aren't they reusable/restartable?  Would a LEV fit in a DC-1? I've forgotten (if I ever knew) what the cargo bay dimensions are for theDC-1.All in all, I'm not certain that the single goal/prize of staying on themoon for a year is wise and/or useful.  How about:  A prize for the firstnon-government sponsered unmanned moon landing, then another for a mannedmoon landing, then yet another for a system to extract consumables fromlunar soil, another for a reusable earth/moon shuttle, and so forth.  Findsome way to build civilian moonbase infrastructure...  Having a single goalmight result in a bunch of contestents giving up after one person appearedto win.  And for those that didn't give up, I find something a little scaryabout a half dozen people huddling in rickety little moon shelters.  I'dlike to see as much a reward for co-operation as for competition.Lastly, about ten or fifteen years back I seem to recall that there was anEnglish space magazine that had an on-going discussion about moonbases onthe cheap.  I recalled it discussed things like how much heat the humanbody produced, how much lunar material it'd need for protection from solarflares, etc.  Unfortunately I don't remember the name of this magazine.

Newsgroup:comp.windows.xdocument_id: 67247From: ge!severy%severy@uunet.UU.NET (severy)Subject: Overriding window manager focus processing     I am working on an X-Window based application that needs to override some of the window manager focus processing.  I am using X11R4 and Motif 1.1 currently, although I will also be working with Open Look in the future.     What I need to do is under certain circumstances prevent the user from switching from one window of the application to another window.  Let's say, for example, that Window A is on top of Window B in the window hierarchy.  Normally, if the user clicks the mouse in Window B it will be brought to the top of the window hierarchy and placed on top of Window A.  Under certain circumstances if the user clicks the mouse in Window B I need to beep and prevent Window B from being raised on top of Window A.      From the research and testing I've done so far, it appears that this window ordering is handled by the window manager, in this case Motif.  I haven't found any way to override this default processing through standard X Window functions.  I can tell when this switching occurs through focus change and mapping notify events, but I can't find any way to tell Motif not to make the switch.      The temporary solution I've currently come up with is very kludgy but it partially works.  When I detect such a window switch in those cases when the switch is not allowed, I manually force the formerly top window back on top with an XRaiseWindow call and beep with the XBell function.  This provides the necessary functionality but looks ugly when the windows switch places twice.      Does anyone know how I can tell Motif (or preferably *any* window manager) when I don't want the window order switch to actually take place?  Respond either by e-mail or posting to this newsgroup.Cheers....

I consider 5' a reasonable spacelimitation, but make no mistake a gun blowing up is a hazard tothose nearby, say in the next lane at the range.  My point was atwhat distance, or level of threat, we draw the line.  Is it theendangerment of others, so we do a 5' restriction, or the possibilityof being shot, hence we draw a 1.5 mile restriction, or a nuke anddraw a 5 mile restriction?  To me they al suffer from the fundamentalflaw that they restrict based upon the instrument rather than placingthe responsibility for usage squarely upon the shoulders of the user.Perhaps Sen. Metzenbaum declaring the Barrett Light Fifty an assaultrifle has made this more apparent to me, since the Barrett hasonly range and acurracy going for it.>They have determined that their lives are worth the effort to>protect their homes and families. Using nuclear weapons close >to home will not accomplish this.	I disagree, on the grounds that a house can be rebuilt muchmore easily than my family once I have died.  I assume that wordwould get to the citizens that such an attack was planned.  If thisis not the case, the tactical and strategic implications changequite a bit.  Personally, my home is worth, say, twenty Martiansintent on taking over the world.  My family?  All of them.

That seems to be the case already, given that heavyweapons aren't commonly owned by the citizenry.  With such lownumbers, obviously due to cost, I don't think the superiorweapons are going to be of great effect against a numericallysuperior foe.  Furthermore, it is even more doubtful their trainingincludes proper tactical movements that best utilize tanks,whereas the commonly rifleman is not so hampered in effectiveness.>I think it is vital to avoid such a situation, where a small >minority would have a reasonable chance of gaining political power>through violence.

I had envisioned that the armorer, perhaps the officersof a select group, and the like would exercise control over theheavier, more complex weapons.  But, if Joe Bob owns an old Shermantank I certainly wouldn't ask him to give it up.  Follow ordersfrom the officers, yes.  Since the expense of a tank is so large,though, chances are it would be jointly purchased and shouldtherefore be jointly maintained and operated.>Here, I think we have to be carefull about _which_ ""state"" we>are talking about: Certainly one role of the militia is to>overthrow a repressive government, and it would be completely>destructive to that end for that same government to control >the militia's arms.

The State having controlover the heavy weapons should not be justification for the stateto have them centrally located.  Keep them spread out, such thatthe ability of the State to lock them up isn't so easy.  Otherwise,I would have to assume that State control would rest on theauthority of the Governor and militia officers.>That is eaxctly why I think they should be removed: The select>militia should privide the militia's heavy weapons and highly-trained>specialists. For the reasons I have outlines above, I think >these heavy weapons (tanks, artillery, aircraft, etc...) are>better off being kept by local governments than by a small >number of individuals.

I'm having a hard time seeing how these heavy weapons,fairly few in numbers, could not be easily wielded by a fewpeople with government support.  Just as you argued above thatthe weapons should be divvied up and under democratic controlso one side doesn't have all of them, I can't see where thissituation is alleviated in having the select militia holdingall the weapons and the unorganized militia being the infantry.I think a better mix is called for.  But, I would argue thatthe Federal army should rely upon the select militia and theunorganized militia for the bulk of its infantry units.>Consider, then, the effect of removing the National Guard's>infantry and placing the Guard under the control of local>governments. The government-controled select militia could>not fight effectively without infantry support provided by>the general militia (an inherently infantry organization.) >On the other hand, the general militia could function (although>at a disadvantage) without the backing of local governments and>the select militia.	We have to assume that there would be those who wouldside with the government-controlled forces, and if they've allthe equipment an infantry force 3x the size would be in trouble.I'd like to see that heavy stuff, say tanks, offset by thelocal troups having a few 105's and anti-tank weapons in theirarmory.  These would be much more useful to infantry than thetank would be when cost and training requirements are figured in.I suppose I'm quibbling over what constitutes heavy equipment.>>...but a mechanized infantry unit is what builds>>dikes in times of flood, sets up disaster relief cities, and>>the like.>>I would much rather see these things handled by the local, >general militias.	So would I, but the resources often aren't available tooutfit local units well enough.  Thus, we will certainly have tocall in others, and a mechanized unit carries more stuff fasterthan anything else.>Perhaps the National Guard isn't as close to my conception of>the select militia as I thought: I was considering them to >be the heavy weapons/armor arm of the militia, not the infantry>arm of the regular army.	Perhaps our ideas of heavy weapons are different?  I thinkmain battle tanks, self-propelled artillery, and 155mm and upfield pieces are heavy stuff.  M113 troop carriers, 2 1/2 tontrucks, HumVee's, old M60 tanks, 105 Howitzers, are more the stuffof a mechanized infantry.  Actually, this is what the Guard unitsin Iowa are currently fielding in some units.	Perhaps it is just my innate fear of having the real heavyequipment under State control, with little but numbers and lightstuff to act as a deterrent.  Allowing main battle tanks to thestates should be balanced with anti-tank capability in the localranks.  Similarly, local units would need to band together quickly,hence small and fast response means mechanized infantry.  Finally,the militia is more than just fighting.  Equipment is needed forother responses.  The Federal army, I'm convinced, should have avery minumum of infantry, relying on the state and local militiasfor these functions.< Dan Sorenson, DoD #1066 z1dan@exnet.iastate.edu viking@iastate.edu ><  ISU only censors what I read, not what I say.

The United States delegation of General Harbord has seen the thousands of refugees who came  to take refuge with Kazim Karabekir's soldiers, hungry and miserable,  their children and wives, their properties destroyed, and the delegation was a witness to the cruelties. Many Muslim villages have been destroyed by the soldiers of Armenian troops armed with cannons and machine guns before the eyes of Karabekir's troops and the people.

According to documented information, 28 Muslim villages have been destroyed in the aforementioned region, more than 2,000 people have been slaughtered, many possessions and livestock have been seized, young Muslim women have been taken to Kars and Gumru, thousands of women and children who were able to flee their villages were beaten, raped and massacred in the mountains, and this aggression against the properties, lives, chastity  and honour of the Muslims continued. It was the responsibility of the Armenian Government that the cruelties and massacres be stopped in order  to alleviate the tensions of Muslim public opinion due to the atrocities  committed by the Armenians, that the possessions taken from the Muslims be returned and that indemnities be paid, that the properties, lives, and honour of the Muslims be protected.""Serdar Argic                           'We closed the roads and mountain passes that                             might serve as ways of escape for the Turks                             and then proceeded in the work of extermination.'

From A Dictionary of Philosophy, by Anthony Flew: ""Objectivism:  The belief that there are certain moral truths that wouldremain true whatever anyone or everyone thought or desired.  Forinstance, 'No one should ever deliberately inflict pain on anothersimply to take pleasure in his suffering' might be thought of as aplausible example.  Even in a world of sadists who all rejected it, thecontention remains true, just as '5 + 7 = 12' remains correct even ifthere is no one left to count.  The problem for the objectivist is todetermine the status of moral truths and the method by which they can beestablished.  If we accept that such judgements are not reports of whatis but only relate to what ought to be (see naturalistic fallacy) thenthey cannot be proved by any facts about the nature of the world.  Norcan they be analytic, since this would involve lack of action-guidingcontent;  'One ought always to do the right thing' is plainly true invirtue of the vords involved but it is unhelpful as a practical guide toaction (see analytic and synthetic).  At this point the objectivist maytalk of 'self-evident truths', but can he deny the subjectivist's claimthat self-evidence is in the mind of the beholder?  If not, what is leftof the claim that some moral judgements are true?  THe subjectivist maywell feel that all that remains is that there are some moral judgementswith which he would wish to associate himself.  To hold a moral opinionis, he suggests, not to know something to be true but to havepreferences regarding human activity."" David Nye (nyeda@cnsvax.uwec.edu).

I haveheard horror stories about the Access programming being extremely cryptic.Since you seem like you will probably be doing fairly small stuff (work/home use and you have not used a database before), I recommend Approach.  I have found only one small thing which I would like it to do more easily:I have one database where the order in which the records are entered must be different than what is the logical ordering.  To permanently reorder (to use the old DBASE III command) the records requires sorting the records appropriately (no problem, since I almost always use them in this order)exporting the database to another database (which can still be an Approach database), and then copying the exported files back to the original filename.  This is a small weakness, considering the other items I really like about Approach.  It is also a little slower than Paradox (other than the loading, Paradox takes forever and a minute to load).  Paradox also takes a lot of memory (both hard disk (around 12MB) and RAM).Greg Bishop. (bishop@baeyer.chem.fsu.edu)"	comp.os.ms-windows.misc

Miracleberries contain a protein, _miraculin_, that modifies sweet receptors insuch a way that they can be stimulated by acids (Bartoshuk, Gentile, Moskowitz, & Meiselman, 1974).  If you ever get a chance to chew a miracleberry (and I do recommend it), for about the next half an hour all acids (which are normally sour) will taste sweet.  They will continue to tastesour as well.Miraculin was, for a time, commercially available in the United States as adiet aid.  The idea was that dieters could coat their tongue with a miraculinpill and then eat and drink unsweetened, slightly acidic substances.  Suchsubstances would taste sweet without providing many calories.A colleague and I once spent an evening experimenting with miracle berries.We drank straight lemon juice, sauerkraut juice, even vinegar.

The window-manager is not responding because|> it thinks the window is already in the right place.|> |> Exactly *why* the two components get into this sulk is unclear to|> me; all information greatly received.This problem is caused by a bad interaction between the way olwm reparentswindows, a misfeature of the X protocol, and a bug in the Xt intrinsics.  The Intrinsics bug is that it ignores the (x,y) position given inReparentNotify events.  Olwm is structured in such a way that, when a windowis popped down, the last event the client receives is a ReparentNotify event. At this point, the Intrinsics' notion of the shell's location is out of date.If a SetValues is done using the same (x,y) position, the Intrinsics thinks itneeds to move the shell, so it issues a ConfigureWindow request to move itthere.  However, a (mis)feature of the X protocol is that a ConfigureWindowrequest that has no effect will generate no ConfigureNotify event.  TheIntrinsics thus waits for an event that will never arrive, and times out afterwmTimeout has expired.  (Actually, things are somewhat more complex becausethe request is redirected to the window manager, but the net result is thesame.)The solution is for the Intrinsics to note the (x,y) positioning informationin ReparentNotify events.

The drug dealers and terrorists aren't going to letthemselves be caught by using this type of encryption.  In 1985the New York Times reported that government investigators brokeup a narcotics ring that was operating highly sophisticatedequipment capable of allowing the leaders of the ring toeavesdrop on the law-enforcement agents who were trying to arrestthem.     A Mr. Deely, an NSA official, said ""There are a lot ofmedium-sized countries that would have been proud to have thesignals intelligence operation of this group.""     For every John Gotti there are probably many more people whohave the sophistication to know what the risks of unsecurecommunications are.  The press given to the Big Brother chip willonly increase their numbers.     Even if there is some benefit to law-enforcement through theuse of Big Brother, it must be weighed against the constitutionaland civil liberties questions involved.     For example, in some areas of the world torture is used asan investigative tool by the local ""law-enforcement"" people.  Isuspect it is an effective means of obtaining information andshortening many investigations.  It probably also helps keep theconviction rate high.     The fact that the torture tool is not used in this country(even with a court order obtained by showing ""probable cause"") isbecause we have rightly balanced the questions of expediency andwhat is ethically and morally right.     I think that the same question of expediency versus moralityshould come into play when considering the use of Big Brother.  Ivote for morality.     I am quite disturbed by what I interpret as a veiled threatto prohibit the use of all encryption if this Big Brother chip isnot put into wide spread use.  After a quick reading of the WhiteHouse press release I came away with that impression.     To most of the American public, the word ""hacker"" hasrightly or wrongly come to mean ""high tech adolescent vandal"".It has struck me that most of the people posting to sci.cryptregarding this issue are intelligent, thoughtful individuals whohave genuine concerns about the privacy and constitutional issuessurrounding Big Brother.  I hope that the use of Big Brother doesnot become mandatory and other encryption become illegal.  Iwould hate to see this become some kind of high tech VolsteadAct.     The high speed digital communications revolution is comingat us with the speed of an SST.  The times they are a changing,and just as IBM is learning that they can't do business the sameway they have done it for the past 40 years, maybe NSA shouldevaluate another approach.     EFF, who have correctly questioned the cryptographicstrength of Big Brother, may need to send a stronger message outregarding the constitutional issues involved.     Al Gore may want to think this one through a little more.     And as for Dorothy Elizabeth Robling Denning: En quoi celavous concerne, cheri?"	sci.crypt

Many of thesemail servers have a command like   path a_valid_return_e-mail_addressto get a hint for sending back to you stuff.DEC's FTPMAIL-------------  Send a one-line message to ftpmail@decwrl.dec.com WITHOUT a Subject: field,  and having a line containing the word 'help'.  You should get back a message detailing the relevant procedures you  must follow in order to get the files you want.  Note that the ""reply"" or ""answer"" command in your mailer will not work  for this message or any other mail you receive from FTPMAIL.  To send  requests to FTPMAIL, send an original mail message, not a reply.  Complaints should be sent to the ftpmail-request@uucp-gw-2.pa.dec.com  address rather than to postmaster, since DECWRL's postmaster is not  responsible for fixing ftpmail problems.BITFTP------  For BITNET sites ONLY, there's BITFTP@PUCC.

Every phone comes with a built inchip and the government has the key to every phone call. I go and buy a phone and dutifully register the key. What's to prevent me from swapping phones with a friend or buying a used phone at a garage sale? Whooa. The secret registeredkeys just became unsynchronized. When the government comes to listen in, they only receive gobbledly-gook because the secret key registered under my name isn't the right one. That leads me to conjecture that:1) The system isn't that secure. There are just two master keysthat work for all the phones in the country. The part aboutregistering your keys is just bogus. or 2) The system is vulnerable to simple phone swapping attackslike this.

I had never met thisdoctor before, and she did not know what I was there for. As soon as Iarrived, somebody showed me to an examining room and handed me a gown.They told me to undress (from the waist down, to be exact) and wait for thedoctor. Is this the usual drill when you go to a doctor for the firsttime? I don't have much experience going to doctors (knock on wood), buton the couple of occasions when I've gone to a new doctor, I met himwith my clothes on. First, he introduced himself, asked what I was therefor and took a history, all before I undressed. Are patients usually expected to get naked before meeting a doctorfor the first time? Personally, I'd prefer to meet the doctor onsomething remotely resembling a condition of parity and to establish anidentity as a person who wears clothes before dropping my drawers. Ifnothing else, it minimizes the time that I have to spend in the selfconscious, ill at ease and vulnerable condition of a person with a barebottom talking to somebody who is fully clothed.

The P1,P2 jumpers tell it to use the printerport as LPT1 or LPT2. I am guessing that the ""G"" enables the game port andthe ""S2"" SHOULD enable the second serial port, but I can't get it to work. Ihave tried numerous setting on the IRQ bank without success. I assume thatthis bank must tell the card which IRQ's to use for both ports, but I don;tknow how.  Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated!!EBD-- Elliot Dierksen   ""Is that a real poncho... I mean is that a Mexican poncho or                   is that a Sears  poncho?

Newsgroup:comp.os.ms-windows.miscdocument_id: 10016Subject: Is SMARTDRV.EXE causing bad sectors on my hd?From: jdriver@netlink.cts.com (John Driver)        I am having something very unusual happen.  First some background on my system.  I have a Mitsubishi 63 meg Hard Drive, and am running Smartdrv (the version that comes with Windows 3.1) on it.  I rarely use Windows.  I use a program called Disk Technician Gold v1.14 to do diagnostics live time on my hard drive.  It works by having a device driver detect whenever more than one read is necessary for a file, or if there is anything else is wrong with it, and minor problems are fully checked out upon rebooting.  My hard drive is notorious for bad sectors.  I usually end up with 8 new bad sectors a week.         Here's what happened:  I ran a program, and DTG broke in with an Emergency Warning and recommended I reboot.  It gave me this message twice before the program was fully loaded.  I exited the program and did just this.  DTG went through its bootup process, examining for new errors etc., and a screen popped up and said something about sectors for a brief period of time.         I then went back to the program, executed it again, and the exact same error was detected.  I rebooted and tried again, and the same error happened again.  So, I removed DTG from memory, and went to the program to see if I could detect anything wrong.  Sure enough there was a number of read attempts.  So I rebooted and reloaded DTG, but removed the cache.  I executed the program.  No read errors, either audible or detected by DTG.  I quit the program, loaded the cache, and ran the program again.  The errors were detected.         Ok, so the errors are there, and DTG detects but doesn't fix them, when the cache is loaded.  When the cache is not loaded there are no errors.  So, to see if the cache was interfering with any other files, I went into xtree gold and tagged all files, and searched them for a random string (in other words, I wanted the program to completely read every file on my hard drive).  Before I got through the c's DTG had detected at least six errors and recommended I reboot.         Does anybody, have any idea why Smartdrv is causing misreads on my hard drive?  Oh, there are exactly two misreads per file, and 1 in about every 100 files are affected.           I originally posted this message to Disk Technician Corp.'s system, but I figured someone out in netland may know enough about smartdrv to help me out.--                    INTERNET:  jdriver@netlink.cts.com (John Driver)UUCP:   ...!ryptyde!netlink!jdriverNetLink Online Communications * Public Access in San Diego, CA (619) 453-1115	comp.os.ms-windows.misc

When a goalkeeper gets hot, there is little an opposing team can do.Joseph should be given the entire city of St. Louis, because otherwise there would probably be a game 6 scheduled.  As for the game on Sunday.  The Blues caught a few breaks, without a doubt.One was the Referee constantly watching the Blackhawks, looking for reasons togive them penalties.  Second, The Blues first goal resulted because the puckhit the linesman as the Blackhawks attempted to clear.  No linesman, no shotfor Brett(I can redirect anything)Hull to redirect.  On another of St. Louis'goals, Belfour was tripped from behind as he went to make the save by someonewho didn't belong in the crease, which means it was a St. Louis player.Finally, the overtime goal was caused because someone kept Belfour from getting back to the crease.

ADVOCATE OF LUNAR POWER SYSTEM AS ENERGY SOURCE FOR THE WORLD   On April 21, the OASIS and Ventura County chapters of the National Space Society will sponsor a talk by Lunar Power System (LPS) co-inventor and vice-president of the LPS Coalition, Dr. Robert D.Waldron.  It will be held at 7:30 p.m. at the Rockwell ScienceCenter in Thousand Oaks, CA.   Dr. Waldron is currently a Technical Specialist in SpaceMaterials Processing with the Space Systems Division of RockwellInternational in Downey, California.  He is a recognized worldauthority on lunar materials refinement.  He has written orcoauthored more than 15 articles or reports on nonterrestrialmaterials processing or utilization.  Along with Dr. DavidCriswell, Waldron invented the lunar/solar power system concept.   Momentum is building for a coalition of entrepreneurs, legalexperts, and Soviet and U.S. scientists and engineers to buildthe Lunar Power System, a pollution-free, energy source with apotential to power the globe.   For the past three years members of the coalition, nearly halffrom California, have rejuvenated the commercial and scientificconcept of a solar power system based on the Moon.   The LPS concept entails collecting solar energy on the lunarsurface and beaming the power to Earth as microwaves transmittedthrough orbiting antennae.  A mature LPS offers an enormoussource of clean, sustainable power to meet the Earth's everincreasing demand using proven, basic technology.

If you want to modify video driver, please read section (8).(2) Hardware Requirement:  PC 386 or better. MSDOS 3.3 or higher.  min amount of ram is 4M bytes(Maybe less memory will also work).  (I recommend min 8M bytes for better performance).  Hard disk for swapping(virtual memory).  The following description is borrowed from DJGPP.  Supported Wares:  * Up to 128M of extended memory (expanded under VCPI)  * Up to 128M of disk space used for swapping  * SuperVGA 256-color mode up to 1024x768  * 80387  * XMS & VDISK memory allocation strategies  * VCPI programs, such as QEMM, DESQview, and 386MAX  Unsupported:  * DPMI  * Microsoft Windows  Features: 80387 emulator, 32-bit unix-ish environment, flat memory  model, SVGA graphics.(3) Installation:  Video drivers, emu387 and go32.exe are borrowed from DJGPP.

All Read/Write support full color(8 bits), grey scale, b/w dither,      and 24 bits image, if allowed for that format.(7) Detail:   Initialization:      Set default display type to highest display type.      Find allowable screen resolution(for .grn video driver only).   1. When you run this program, you will enter 'read' menu. Whthin this      menu you can press any function key except F5. If you move or copy      files, you will enter 'write' menu. the 'write' menu is much like      'read' menu, but only allow you to change directory.+       The header line in 'read' menu includes ""(d:xx,f:xx,t:xx)"".+         d : display type. f: number of files. t: number of tagged files.      pressing SPACE in 'read' menu will let you select which format to use        for reading current file.      pressing RETURN in 'read' menu will let you reading current file. This        program will automatically determine which format this file is.        The procedure is: First, check magic number. If fail, check        standard extension. Still fail, report error.      pressing s or S in 'read' menu will do 'Slide Show'.        If delay time is 0, program will wait until you hit a key          (except ESCAPE).        If any error occurs, program will make a beep.        ESCAPE to terminate.      pressing Ins in 'read' menu will change display type.      pressing ALT-X in 'read' menu will quit program without prompting.   2. Once image file is successfully read, you will enter 'screen' menu.      Within this menu F5 is turn on. You can do special effect on image.      pressing RETURN: show image.        in graphic mode, press RETURN, SPACE or ESCAPE to return to text        mode.      pressing TAB: change processing target. This program allows you to do        special effects on 8-bit or 24-bit image.      pressing Left,Right arrow: change display type. 8, 15, 16, 24 bits.      pressing SPACE: save current image to file.        B/W Dither: save as black/white image(1 bit).        Grey Scale: save as grey image(8 bits).        Full Color: save as color image(8 bits).        True Color: save as 24-bit image.        This program will ask you some questions if you want to write image        to file. Some questions are format-dependent. Finally This program        will prompt you a filename. If you want to save file under another        directory other than current directory, please press SPACE. after        pressing SPACE, you will enter 'write2' menu. You can change        directory to what you want. Then,        pressing SPACE: this program will prompt you 'original' filename.        pressing RETURN: this program will prompt you 'selected' filename                      (filename under bar).  3. This program supports 8, 15, 16, 24 bits display.  4. This Program is MEMORY GREEDY. If you don't have enough memory,     the performance is poor.  5. If you want to save 8 bits image :       try GIF then TIFF(LZW) then TARGA then Sun Raster then BMP then ...     If you want to save 24 bits image (lossless):       try TIFF(LZW) or TARGA or ILBM or Sun Raster       (No one is better for true 24bits image)  6. I recommend Jpeg for storing 24 bits images, even 8 bits images.  7. Not all subroutines are fully tested  8. This document is not well written. If you have any PROBLEM, SUGGESTION,     COMMENT about this program,     Please send to u7711501@bicmos.ee.nctu.edu.tw (140.113.11.13).     I need your suggestion to improve this program.

Is anyone out there in Christendomlistening? If so, why don't we get some dialog going here?Here's a topic to get things started. My daughter's Christian school sendshome a weekly update on school related topics. This week they sentsomething *very* interesting. It was an article written by the leader of anational (US) Christian school organization about a trip he recently madeto Jerusalem. While there, he was introduced to one of the rabbis who isworking on a project to rebuild the Temple at Jerusalem. The articleincluded photos of the many furnishings that have already been made inpreparation for furnishing the rebuilt temple according to thespecifications given in the Bible. What was even more striking is the fact that the plans for the temple arecomplete and the group is only awaiting permission from the Israeligovernment before beginning the building. The other startling fact is thevery recent archeological discovery that the original site of the temple isunoccupied and available for building. Previously it has been thought thatthe original site was underneath what is now a mosque, making rebuildingimpossible without sparking a holy war. Now it appears that nothing stands in the way of rebuilding and resumingsacrifices, as the Scriptures indicate will happen in the last days.Although the Israeli government will give the permission to start, I thinkit is the hand of God holding the project until He is ready to let ithappen. Brothers and sisters, the time is at hand. Our redemption isdrawing near.

"Newsgroup:comp.windows.xDocument_id: 67433From: Wilfred.Hansen@cs.cmu.EDUSubject: AIX3.2 version of Andrew 5.1                          The Andrew Consortium          of the School of Computer Science at Carnegie Mellon                          is pleased to announce                          AUIS 5.1.1 for AIX3.2                                 4/26/93The Andrew User Interface System version 5.1 (our CDrom version) wasdeveloped for AIX  version 3.1 on the IBM RS/6000 and many otherplatforms.  To accomodate AIX version 3.2, we have created a patch tothe sources.  The patch and accompanying instructions for itsapplication can be retrieved at no charge via anonymous-ftp from theinternet host emsworth.andrew.cmu.edu (128.2.45.40) in the directory./aixpatch.  For those without internet access, a 3.5"" diskette can beordered for $10 by sending, or faxing, a purchase order to the addressbelow. The base 5.1 system can be ordered from us as a CDrom or ftp'ed from thesame host.Note that this patch adds no additional functionality but simply allowsAUIS to compile under AIX3.2.-----------The Andrew User Interface System (AUIS) is a comprehensive environmenton top of X11 windows in which you can create, use, and mail multi-mediaapplications and documents.   A major advantage of AUIS is thecapability to recursively embed objects.  Thus, one can edit text thatnot only contains multiple fonts, indentation, and other typography, butalso  contains embedded raster images, spreadsheets, drawing editors,equations, simple animations, and so on. These embedded objects canthemselves contain other objects, including text.AUIS has three components:    The Andrew User Environment is an integrated and extensible set    of applications beginning with the ez text editor, a help    system, a system monitoring tool, an editor-based shell    interface, and other editors corresponding to the various    available types of objects.     The Andrew Toolkit (ATK) is a portable, object-oriented    user-interface toolkit that provides the architecture wherein    objects can be embedded in one-another.  With the toolkit,    programmers can create new objects that can be embedded as    easily as those that come with the system.     The Andrew Message System (AMS) provides a multi-media interface    to mail and bulletin-boards.  AMS supports several mail    management strategies and implements many advanced  features    including authentication, return receipts, automatic sorting of    mail, vote collection and tabulation, enclosures, audit trails    of related messages, and subscription management. It also    provides a variety of interfaces that support ttys and    low-function personal computers in addition to high-function    workstations. The current public release of Andrew, Version 5.1,  includes support forthe new Internet MIME (Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions) standardsfor multipart, multimedia mail.  A newer release, 5.2, for members ofthe Andrew Consortium has numerous additional features including neweditors for drawings, images, fonts, and user preferences.Remote Andrew Demo ServiceYou can try out Andrew from your own work station via the Remote AndrewDemo Service.  You need a host machine on the Internet running the X11window system.  You'll be able to compose multimedia documents, navigatethrough the interactive Andrew Tour, and use the Andrew Message Systemto browse through a few of CMU's four thousand bulletin boards andnewsgroups.To get started with the Remote Andrew Demo service, simply run thefollowing command on your machine:	finger help@atk.itc.cmu.eduThe service will give you further instructions.

Only change the tactics.For instance, here are how some penalties should be changed.Dealing Coke -- DeathDealing Heroin -- DeathDealing Pot -- DeathDealing Crack -- DeathThe list goes on and on!!!......JUST KIDDING!!!However, on a more serious note, I do believe that we should take some money away from the foriegn operations in South America and costly border interdiction efforts.  (Don't think I'm going to say, ""spend it to educate people"", because I know plenty of educated dopers).  Actually, spend it on  things like drug treatment programs.I saw an interesting story on 60 minutes about how the British actually prescribe and addict his ""recommended"" dosage, and try to ween him off from it,or cut the amount down to levels where it is ""acceptable"".  Sounds good so far from what I heard with a decrease in cost, lower addiction rates by wiping out the dealer's markets, etc. (But that was the only thing I have heard about it.)However, legalizing it and just sticking some drugs in gas stations to be bought like cigarettes is just plain silly.  Plus, I have never heard of a recommended dosage for drugs like crack, ecstasy, chrystal meth and LSD.The 60 Minute Report said it worked with ""cocaine"" cigarettes, pot and heroin.Ryan"	talk.politics.misc

I walked by, and they were showing real-time video captureusing a (Radious or SuperMac?) card to digitize and make right on the spotquicktime movies.  I think the quicktime they were using was the old one(1.5).   They digitized a guy talking there in 160x2xx something.  It played back quitenicely and in real time.  The guy then expanded the window (resized) to 25x by3xx (320 in y I think) and the frame rate decreased enough to notice that itwasn't 30fps (or about 30fps) anymore.  It dropped to like 15 fps.  Then heincreased it just a bit more, and it dropped to 10<->12 fps.    Then I asked him what Mac he was using... He was using a Quadra (don't knowwhat model, 900?) to do it, and he was telling the guys there that the Quicktimecould play back at the same speed even on an LCII.   Well, I spoiled his claim so to say, since a 68040 Quadra Mac was havinga little bit of trouble.  And this wasn't even from the hardisk!  This wasfrom memory!   Could it be that you saw either a newer version of quicktime, or somehardware assisted Centris, or another software product running the animation (like supposedly MacroMind's Accelerator?)?   Don't misunderstand me, I just want to clarify this.   But for the sake of the posting about a computer doing it or not, I canclaim 320x200 (a tad more with overscan) being done in 256,000+ colors in my computer (not from the hardisk) at 30fps with Scala MM210.

This could be substantiallythe same as the cripple chip, except that instead of key-registration, thepolice could demand that you give up your secret key to them (with a court-issued warrant).  Then, they could read the last few months of wiretappedmessages you've sent, and assuming you've committed no crimes, you couldgenerate a new key pair and go about your business.  I find that I'd bewilling to pay RSA for the right to use such a system, especially given thealternative.  If you were unwilling to give up your secret key, then you'dprobably stay in jail (has anyone got a real legal precedent for this?).   This would allow court-issued warrants to be used to gather informationon suspected criminals, but it couldn't be done in secrecy, and therewould be enormously less likelihood of corruption or theft of escrowed keys.(Maybe someone from the law-enforcement or intelligent community will correctme, but this doesn't *seem* like such a big loss in terms of law-enforcementcapabilities.)

It boggles my mind that in my lifetime, there were""whites only"" drinking fountains in some parks, but no fountainsfor others, yet the taxes garnished to support those fountainscertainly were not applied to ""whites only.""  In essence, wecannot escape the coercive state.  Even Randy Weavers have to payproperty tax.

The issue was not the number of pages the book has..or the year first published..  And you tried to hide the whole point.. the point is that both books have the exactly the same quotes about how moslems are killed, tortured,etc by Armenians..and those quotes given  by Serdar Argic exist!!

You should indeed be happy to know that you rekindled a huge discussion ondistortions propagated by several of your contemporaries. If you feel that you can simply act as an Armenian governmental crony in this forum you will be sadly mistaken and duly embarrassed. This is not a lecture to another historical revisionist and a genocide apologist, but a fact.I will dissect article-by-article, paragraph-by-paragraph, line-by-line, lie-by-lie, revision-by-revision, written by those on this net, who plan to 'prove' that the Armenian genocide of 2.5 million Turks and Kurds is nothing less than a classic un-redressed genocide. We are neither in x-Soviet Union, nor in some similar ultra-nationalist fascist dictatorship, that employs the dictates of Hitler to quell domestic unrest. Also, feel free to distribute all responses to your nearest ASALA/SDPA/ARF terrorists,the Armenian pseudo-scholars, or to those affiliated with the Armeniancriminal organizations.Armenian government got away with the genocide of 2.5 million Turkish men,women and children and is enjoying the fruits of that genocide. You, and those like you, will not get away with the genocide's cover-up.Not a chance.Serdar Argic                           'We closed the roads and mountain passes that                             might serve as ways of escape for the Turks                             and then proceeded in the work of extermination.'

One approach is simply to try and move political opinionand hope a new more libertarian consensus lasts for a while.  Anotherapproach is to try and amend the constitution.  The originalconstitution restrained the U.S. government from economic interventionfor 100 to 150 years, depending on just how one wants to count it.The First Amendment, though weakened in many ways, still restrainsgovernment (particularly state and local), even though on manyparticular issues the majority is in favor of censorship.  I thinklibertarians would be happy with another 100 years of restraint viaan amendment or two (not that I think that's likely to happen).Not necessarily Mr. Hendricks, but other posters seem to see this asa problem with libertarianism, that it cannot be stable.  That mightbe true, but it is not an objection to libertarianism per se.  Ifa libertarian political consensus forms for a decade or two and thenfalls apart again, we would just be back where we are now.  This isunlike the case for socialism where a socialist consensus that heldfor a while and then fell apart would not leave us where we are now,but instead with lots of bureaucracy that would be hard to get rid of,if not tyranny as the end condition of a strong socialist consensus.-- Ervan Darnell                                        ervan@cs.rice.edu	talk.politics.misc

I appliedto about 20 schools, got two interviews, got one offer, and am waiting tohear from the other school.Let me be honest about my experiences and impressions about the medicalschool admissions process.  Numbers (GPA, MCATs) are not everything, but they are probably more important than anything else.  In fact, someschools screen out applicants based on these numbers and never even lookat your other qualities.  Of course, when this happens, don't expect a refundon your $50 application fee.But, the fact that you got four interviews tells me that you have the numbersand are very well qualified academically.  You mentioned one response, was itan acceptance, denial, or wait-list?  If I assume the worst, that it was adenial, then you still have a great probability of acceptance somewhere.  Howdid your interviews go?As for how long you have to wait, I've called a few schools who never contactedme for anything.  Many of them told me that the interview season for them wasover and that if I haven't heard by now, I can assume a denial.  Many rejectionletters are not sent out until May or as late as June.  But some schools arestill interviewing. I really don't think you should worry.  Don't becomefixated on the mailbox, go out, have fun, be very proud of yourself.What do people think of the medical school admissions process?  I had a verymediocre GPA, but high MCAT scores, and I have been working as a softwareengineer for two years.  I majored in Computer Science at Stanford.  Still,I think the profile of the person who has the best chance of getting admittedis something like this:VERY IMPORTANT--------------GPA:	3.5 or betterMCAT:   top 15% in all subjectMEDIUM IMPORTANCE-----------------Writing/Speaking abilityMaturityMotivation for going into medicineActivitiesLESS IMPORTANT--------------College or UniversityMajorWork experienceAnything else you want them to knowAnyway, you are in good shape.  I think admissions committees are bound inmany ways by the numbers, but would like very much to understand eachperson as an individual.  Sometimes thats just not practical.

Yes, its great to be involved in a process were I can walk into thelab after a heavy night of dreaming and just do something for the hell of it(as long as my advisor doesn't catch me - which is easy enough to do), but stamping out such behavior seems to be the purpose in life of grant review committees and the peer review process in general.  In today's world that's what determines what science is: what gets funded.  And a damn good thing to.Flights of fantasy just don't have much chance of producing anything, at least not in biomedical research.

Since standard colormapstypically devour all 256 entries, there is no way it can avoiddisplacing the entire default colormap if your hardware has only oneCLUT.I don't believe standard colormaps are intended to aboid possiblecolormap flashing between clients using the default coilormap. Rather,colormap flashing will be avoided between two clients that use thesame standard colormap. An example would be two clients that need afull color range would both use XA_RGB_BEST_MAP (or whatever it'scalled under X11R5).If you are trying to avoid colormap flashing with the defaultcolormap, your best bet is to try to load all the colors you use intothat colormap. If you can't do that, then you'll get flashing on a onehw CLUT framebuffer.Now if your window manager used the same standard colormap as yourclient, this flashing could also be avoided. Perhaps some windowmanagers have command line options for selecting standard colormaps?--    -paul	pmartz@dsd.es.com		Evans & Sutherland"	comp.windows.x

Finally,the 17th was a Saturday without much rain.  In fact it cleared up, became warm and sunny, and the wind died.  About three weeks ago, Itook a long cool ride on the Hawk down to Cycles! 128 for a test ride.They had sold, and delivered, the demo ST1100 about fifteen hoursbefore I arrived.  And the demo VFR was bike-locked in the showroom --surrounded by 150 other bikes, and not likely to move soon.Today was different.  There were even more bikes.  50 used dirt bikes,50 used street bikes, 35 cars, and a big tent full of Outlandishly FatTouring Bikes With Trailers were all squeezed in the parking lot.Some sort of fat bike convention.  Shelly and Dave were running oneMSF course each, at the same time.  One in the classroom and one onthe back lot.  Plus, there was the usuall free cookout food thatCycles! gives away every weekend in the summer.  Hmmm, it seemed likea big moto party.After about ten minutes of looking for Rob C, cheif of sales slime,and another 5 minutes reading and signing a long disclosure/libility/pray-to-god form I helped JT push the ST out into the mess in theparking lot.  We went over the the controls, I put the tank bag from the Hawk into the right saddlebag, and my wife put everything elseinto the left saddlebag.  ( Thats nice.... )  Having helped push the ST out to the lot, I thought it best to have JT move it to the edge ofthe road, away from the 100+ bikes and 100+ people.  He rode it like abicycle!  'It cant be that heavy' I thought.Well I was wrong.  As I sat on the ST, both feet down, all I could think was ""big"".  Then I put one foot up.  ""Heavy"" came to mind veryquickly.  With Cindy on the back -- was she on the back?  Hard to tell with seat three times as large as a Hawk seat -- the bike seemednearly out of control just idling on the side of the road.By 3000 rpm in second gear, all the weight seemed to dissappear.  Evenon bike with 4.1 miles on the odometer, slippery new tires, and pads that did not yet bite the disks, things seems smooth and sure.  Cycles! ison a section of 128 that few folks ever ride.  About 30 miles northof the computer concentration, about five miles north of where I95splits away, 128 is a lighly travelled, two lane limited accesshighway.  It goes through heavily forested sections of Hamilton, Manchester-by-the-Sea and Newbury on its way to Gloucester.On its way there, it meets 133, a road that winds from the sea about30 miles inland to Andover.  On its way it goes through manythoroughly New England spots.  Perfect, if slow, sport touring sections.Cindy has no difficulty with speed.  3rd gear, 4th gear, purring alongin top gear.  This thing has less low rpm grunt that my Hawk.  Lane changes were a new experience.  A big heft is required to move this thing.  Responds well though.   No wallowing or complaint.  Behind thefairing it was fairly quiet, but the helmet buffeting wasnon-trivial.  Top gear car passing at 85mph was nearly effortless.Smooth, smooth, smooth.   Not sure what the v4 sound reminds me of,but it is pleasant.  If only the bars were not transmitting an endlessbuzz.The jump on to 133 caused me to be less than impressed with thebrakes.  Its a down hill, reversing camber, twice-reversing radius,decreasing radius turn.  A real squeeze is needed on the front binder.  The section of 133 we were on was tight, but too urban.  The ST works okin this section, but it shows its weight.  We went by the clam shackoft featured in ""Spencer for Hire"" -- a place where you could really find ""Spencer"", his house was about 15 miles down 133.  After puttingthrough traffic for a while, we turned and went back to 128.About half way through the onramp, I yanked Cindy's wrist, our singalfor ""hold on tight"".  Head check left,  time to find redline.  Secondgear gives a good shove.  Third too.  Fourth sees DoD speed with a short shift into top.  On the way to 133 we saw no cops and very lighttraffic.  Did not cross into DoD zone because the bike was too new.Well, now it had 25 miles on it, so it was ok.  Tried some high effortlane changes, some wide sweeping turns.  Time to wick it up?  I went until the buffeting was threating to pull us off the seat.  And stayedthere.  When I was comfortable with the wind and the steering, I looked down to find an indicated 135mph.  Not bad for 2-up touring.Beverly comes fast at more than twice the posted limit.  At the ""getoff in a mile"" sign, I rolled off the throttle and coasted.  I wantedto re-adjust to the coming slowness.  It was a good idea:  there wereseveral manhole-sized patches of sand on the exit ramp.  Back to the slow and heavy behavior.  Cycles! is about a mile from 128.  I could see even more cars stacked up outside right when I got off.  I managedto thread the ST through the cars to the edge of the concrete padout front.  Heavy.  It took way too much effort for Cindy and I to putthe thing on the center stand.  I am sure that if I used the sidestand the ST would have been on its side within a minute.My demo opinion?  Heavy.  Put it on a diet.  Smooth, comfortable,hardly notices the DoD speed.   I'd buy on for about $3000 less than list, just like it is.  Too much $ for the bike as it is.-- 	 Frank Evan Perdicaro 				Xyvision Color Systems      Legalize guns, drugs and cash...today.		101 Edgewater Drive   inhouse: frank@marvin, x5572				Wakefield MAouthouse: frank@contex.com, 617-245-4100x5572		018801285"	rec.motorcycles

I was so>intent on explaining how Jung thought we could be more moral than God that>I overlooked your main line of thought.>>You seem to be saying that, God being unknowable, His morality is unknowable.Yep, that's pretty much it. I'm not a Jew but I understand that this is theJewish way of thinking. However, the Jews believe that the Covenant betweenYHWH and the Patriarchs (Abraham and Moses, in this case) establishes a MoralCode to follow for mankind. Even the Jews could not decide where the boundariesfall, though.As I understand it, the Sadducees believed that the Torah was all that wasrequired, whereas the Pharisees (the ancestors of modern Judaism) believed thatthe Torah was available for interpretation to lead to an understanding ofthe required Morality in all its nuances (->Talmud).The essence of all of this is that Biblical Morality is an interface betweenMan and YHWH (for a Jew or Christian) and does not necessarily indicateanything about YHWH outside of that relationship (although one can speculate).>>The first thing that comes to mind is that man is supposed to be created>in His image, so there is an argument that we are committed to whatever>moral code He follows as part of trying to live up to that image.  If we>are supposed to live by Christ's example, you would be hard pressed to>argue that God is a ""do what I say, not what I do"" kind of guy.The trouble with all of this is that we don't really know what the ""createdin His image"" means. I've heard a number of different opinions on this andhave still not come to any conclusion. This rather upsets the Apple Cart ifone wants to base a Life Script on this shaky foundation (to mix metaphorsunashamedly!) As to living by Christ's example, we know very little aboutJesus as a person. We only have his recorded utterances in a set of narrativesby his followers, and some very small references from comtemporary historians.Revelation aside, one can only ""know"" Christ second-hand or worse.This is not an attempt to debunk Christianity (although it may seem that wayinitially), the point I`m trying to make is that we only really have the Bibleto interpret, and that interpretation is by humanity. I guess this is whereFaith or Relevation comes in with all its inherent subjectiveness.>>Metaphysically, if there are multiple moral codes then there is no>Absolute moral code, and I think this is theologically questionable.No. There may be an absolute moral code. There are undoubtably multiplemoral codes. The multiple moral codes may be founded in the absolute moralcode. As an example, a parent may tell a child never to swear, and the childmay assume that the parent never swears simply because the parent has toldthe child that it is ""wrong"". Now, the parent may swear like a trooper inthe pub or bar (where there are no children). The ""wrongness"" here is ifthe child disobeys the parent. The parent may feel that it is ""inappropriate""to swear in front of children but may be quite happy to swear in front ofanimals. The analogy does not quite hold water because the child knows thathe is of the same type as the parent (and may be a parent later in life) butyou get the gist of it? Incidentally, the young child considers the directiveas absolute until he gets older (see Piaget) and learns a morality of his own.David.---On religion:""Oh, where is the sea?"", the fishes cried,As they swam its clearness through."	talk.religion.misc

I haven't seen it,or any followup traffic relating to it in these groups or other groupswhich I subscribe to.  So, I am posting it here so others can read it,check it out, and comment on it, and provide ideas for handling thesesorts of things.I have no verification to the accuracy or lack of accuracy of thisarticle, but if accurate, I find it extremely disturbing, especially inlight of various abuses of the SSN number regarding privacy, (I understandit is now to be required in CA to renew a drivers license, or to registera car) and other proposals regarding 'smart' national Identity Cards,wiretap proposals, and such.  One simply wonders what other gems are inthe wings ready to be sprung on the people by our government.  Perhapssuggestions and ideas for preventing this and other such proposals fromacquiring the force of law would be useful.  The cost simply outweighsany possible benefits, IMO.BTW, reading this makes me think of some ideas a Prof Denning has beenpromoting, in an even more disturbing form.That said, with no further comment, the article follows:------------ Begin included article ---------Note:  This file will also be available via anonymous filetransfer from csrc.ncsl.nist.gov in directory /pub/nistnews andvia the NIST Computer Security BBS at 301-948-5717.     ---------------------------------------------------                         THE WHITE HOUSE                  Office of the Press Secretary_________________________________________________________________For Immediate Release                           April 16, 1993                STATEMENT BY THE PRESS SECRETARYThe President today announced a new initiative that will bringthe Federal Government together with industry in a voluntaryprogram to improve the security and privacy of telephonecommunications while meeting the legitimate needs of lawenforcement.The initiative will involve the creation of new products toaccelerate the development and use of advanced and securetelecommunications networks and wireless communications links.For too long there has been little or no dialogue between ourprivate sector and the law enforcement community to resolve thetension between economic vitality and the real challenges ofprotecting Americans.  Rather than use technology to accommodatethe sometimes competing interests of economic growth, privacy andlaw enforcement, previous policies have pitted government againstindustry and the rights of privacy against law enforcement.Sophisticated encryption technology has been used for years toprotect electronic funds transfer.  It is now being used toprotect electronic mail and computer files.  While encryptiontechnology can help Americans protect business secrets and theunauthorized release of personal information, it also can be usedby terrorists, drug dealers, and other criminals.A state-of-the-art microcircuit called the ""Clipper Chip"" hasbeen developed by government engineers.  The chip represents anew approach to encryption technology.  It can be used in new,relatively inexpensive encryption devices that can be attached toan ordinary telephone.  It scrambles telephone communicationsusing an encryption algorithm that is more powerful than many incommercial use today.This new technology will help companies protect proprietaryinformation, protect the privacy of personal phone conversationsand prevent unauthorized release of data transmittedelectronically.  At the same time this technology preserves theability of federal, state and local law enforcement agencies tointercept lawfully the phone conversations of criminals. A ""key-escrow"" system will be established to ensure that the""Clipper Chip"" is used to protect the privacy of law-abidingAmericans.  Each device containing the chip will have two unique                                2""keys,"" numbers that will be needed by authorized governmentagencies to decode messages encoded by the device.  When thedevice is manufactured, the two keys will be deposited separatelyin two ""key-escrow"" data bases that will be established by theAttorney General.  Access to these keys will be limited togovernment officials with legal authorization to conduct awiretap.The ""Clipper Chip"" technology provides law enforcement with nonew authorities to access the content of the privateconversations of Americans.To demonstrate the effectiveness of this new technology, theAttorney General will soon purchase several thousand of the newdevices.  In addition, respected experts from outside thegovernment will be offered access to the confidential details ofthe algorithm to assess its capabilities and publicly reporttheir findings.The chip is an important step in addressing the problem ofencryption's dual-edge sword:  encryption helps to protect theprivacy of individuals and industry, but it also can shieldcriminals and terrorists.  We need the ""Clipper Chip"" and otherapproaches that can both provide law-abiding citizens with accessto the encryption they need and prevent criminals from using itto hide their illegal activities.  In order to assess technologytrends and explore new approaches (like the key-escrow system),the President has directed government agencies to develop acomprehensive policy on encryption that accommodates:     --   the privacy of our citizens, including the need to          employ voice or data encryption for business purposes;     --   the ability of authorized officials to access telephone          calls and data, under proper court or other legal          order, when necessary to protect our citizens;     --   the effective and timely use of the most modern          technology to build the National Information          Infrastructure needed to promote economic growth and          the competitiveness of American industry in the global          marketplace; and      --   the need of U.S. companies to manufacture and export          high technology products.The President has directed early and frequent consultations withaffected industries, the Congress and groups that advocate theprivacy rights of individuals as policy options are developed.                                3The Administration is committed to working with the privatesector to spur the development of a National InformationInfrastructure which will use new telecommunications and computertechnologies to give Americans unprecedented access toinformation.  This infrastructure of high-speed networks(""information superhighways"") will transmit video, images, HDTVprogramming, and huge data files as easily as today's telephonesystem transmits voice.Since encryption technology will play an increasingly importantrole in that infrastructure, the Federal Government must actquickly to develop consistent, comprehensive policies regardingits use.  The Administration is committed to policies thatprotect all Americans' right to privacy while also protectingthem from those who break the law.Further information is provided in an accompanying fact sheet. The provisions of the President's directive to acquire the newencryption technology are also available.

What would they have to do to     decipher the message?A:   They would have to obtain legal authorization, normally a     court order, to do the wiretap in the first place.  They     would then present documentation of this authorization to     the two entities responsible for safeguarding the keys and     obtain the keys for the device being used by the drug     smugglers.  The key is split into two parts, which are     stored separately in order to ensure the security of the key     escrow system.Q:   Who will run the key-escrow data banks?A:   The two key-escrow data banks will be run by two independent     entities.  At this point, the Department of Justice and the     Administration have yet to determine which agencies will     oversee the key-escrow data banks.Q:   How strong is the security in the device?  How can I be sure     how strong the security is?  A:   This system is more secure than many other voice encryption     systems readily available today.  While the algorithm will     remain classified to protect the security of the key escrow     system, we are willing to invite an independent panel of     cryptography experts to evaluate the algorithm to assure all     potential users that there are no unrecognized     vulnerabilities.Q:   Whose decision was it to propose this product?A:   The National Security Council, the Justice Department, the     Commerce Department, and other key agencies were involved in     this decision.  This approach has been endorsed by the     President, the Vice President, and appropriate Cabinet     officials.Q:   Who was consulted?  The Congress?  Industry?A:   We have on-going discussions with Congress and industry on     encryption issues, and expect those discussions to intensify     as we carry out our review of encryption policy.  We have     briefed members of Congress and industry leaders on the     decisions related to this initiative.Q:   Will the government provide the hardware to manufacturers?A:   The government designed and developed the key access     encryption microcircuits, but it is not providing the     microcircuits to product manufacturers.  Product     manufacturers can acquire the microcircuits from the chip     manufacturer that produces them.Q:   Who provides the ""Clipper Chip""?A:   Mykotronx programs it at their facility in Torrance,     California, and will sell the chip to encryption device     manufacturers.  The programming function could be licensed     to other vendors in the future.Q:   How do I buy one of these encryption devices? A:   We expect several manufacturers to consider incorporating     the ""Clipper Chip"" into their devices.     Q:   If the Administration were unable to find a technological     solution like the one proposed, would the Administration be     willing to use legal remedies to restrict access to more     powerful encryption devices?A:   This is a fundamental policy question which will be     considered during the broad policy review.  The key escrow     mechanism will provide Americans with an encryption product     that is more secure, more convenient, and less expensive     than others readily available today, but it is just one     piece of what must be the comprehensive approach to     encryption technology, which the Administration is     developing.     The Administration is not saying, ""since encryption     threatens the public safety and effective law enforcement,     we will prohibit it outright"" (as some countries have     effectively done); nor is the U.S. saying that ""every     American, as a matter of right, is entitled to an     unbreakable commercial encryption product.""  There is a     false ""tension"" created in the assessment that this issue is     an ""either-or"" proposition.  Rather, both concerns can be,     and in fact are, harmoniously balanced through a reasoned,     balanced approach such as is proposed with the ""Clipper     Chip"" and similar encryption techniques.Q:   What does this decision indicate about how the Clinton     Administration's policy toward encryption will differ from     that of the Bush Administration?  A:   It indicates that we understand the importance of encryption     technology in telecommunications and computing and are     committed to working with industry and public-interest     groups to find innovative ways to protect Americans'     privacy, help businesses to compete, and ensure that law     enforcement agencies have the tools they need to fight crime     and terrorism.Q:   Will the devices be exportable?  Will other devices that use     the government hardware?A:   Voice encryption devices are subject to export control     requirements.  Case-by-case review for each export is     required to ensure appropriate use of these devices.  The     same is true for other encryption devices.  One of the     attractions of this technology is the protection it can give     to U.S. companies operating at home and abroad.  With this     in mind, we expect export licenses will be granted on a     case-by-case basis for U.S. companies seeking to use these     devices to secure their own communications abroad.  We plan     to review the possibility of permitting wider exportability     of these products.----------- End included article ----------- -- pat@rwing.uucp      [Without prejudice UCC 1-207]     (Pat Myrto) Seattle, WA         If all else fails, try:       ...!uunet!pilchuck!rwing!patWISDOM: ""Only two things are infinite; the universe and human stupidity,         and I am not sure about the former.""              - Albert Einstien"	sci.crypt

Some said that their heart beat speeded up with flush face. Some>claim their heart ""skipped"" beats once in a while.Both of these symptoms are related - tachycardia. Getting a flushedface is due to the heart pumping the blood faster than a regularpulse.

Our bodies require sodium, but like everything else,one can get too much of a good thing.>Some reacted with headache, Again, this could be related to increased blood flow from increasedheart rate, from the sodium in the MSG.

Again, notnecessarily a discrepency. More likely a related reaction. Vomitingoccurs as a response to get rid of a noxious compound an organism haseaten. If a person can't digest the stuff (entirely possible - thelist of stuff people are allergic to is quite long), and lacks anenzyme to break it down, gastrointestinal distress (stomach or bellyache) would be expected.> Some had watery eyes or running nose,These are respiratory reactions, and are now considered to be similarto vomitting. They are a way for the body to dispose of noxiouscompounds. They are adaptiove responses. Of course, it is possiblesome other food or environmental compound could be responsible for thesymptoms. But it's important to remember that a lot opf these effetscan be additive, synergystic, subtractive, etc, etc. It would benecessary to know exactly what was in a dish, and what else the personwas exposed to. Respiratory does sound suspicious BUT  resopirationand heart rate are connected.  Things in the body are far fromsimple...very inetractive place, the vertebrate body. > some>had itchy skin or rashes. People respond in a myriad of ways to the same compound. It dependsupon what it is about the compound that ""pisses off"" their body.Pollen, for example, of some plants aggrivates breathing in manypeople, because, when inhaled, it sets of the immune system, and anhistamine attack is launched. The immune system goes overboard,causing the allergic person a lot of misery. And someone with anallergy to some pollens will have trouble with some herb teas thatcontain pollens (Chamomile, linden, etc). Drinking the substance canperturb that person's system as much as inhaling it. >More serious accusations include respiration >difficulty See above. And don't think that heart rate changes, and circulatoryproblems are not serious. They can be deadly.and brain damage. The area of the brain effected is the neuroendocrine systemcontrolling the release of gonadotropin, the supra-hormone controllingthe cyclical release of testosterone and estradiol, as well as somatostatin,and other steroids.

In this case. it might be just foodpoisoning. Absolutely.

He did not tell me HOW I could change it usingResEdit, and I have lost his e-mail address.Could he or any one else please tell me what to do?I assume that the relevant resource is zSet, but I do not know, andI have no template for that resource. If you have a TMPL for the correctresource, I would be grateful to receive it. That way, I could play arounda bit and maybe get my Duo to do something useful with its serial port.(other than Appletalk).BTW, I believe that when the port stats says that maximum in buffer is3074 bytes, that that means increasing the buffer will help, if you areusing hardware handshaking. I can cram text data pretty fast into my Duo,and can monitor that CTS is being lowered, but the buffer never gets beyond3074 (out of 4096) bytes.

The server's view of the world, (obtained via xwd |xwud), seems to be exactly what it should be.  However, the displayedversion of the framebuffer gives the impression that the server isusing scanlines that are too long.

Basically, limited tort means that you give up your right to suefor pain and suffering, unless one of the following conditions is met:1. Your medical bills resulting from the accident exceed $X (where X issome number like 50,000 -- I'm not sure of the exact number)2. The accident was caused by a drunk driver (I mean, the OTHER driverwas drunk)3. You get a good lawyer and have a good case (basically, you can appealto regain your right to sue, but there's almost no chance of this everhappening).You are only giving up your right to sue for pain and suffering; you canstill sue for medical costs, actual damages, etc. By agreeing to limitedtort, you are essentially giving up your right to be an asshole whotreats every accident as an entry into the litigation lottery. Inexchange, you get a substantial reduction in your rates. I save$150/year.Unfortunately, the insurance companies have managed to scare and confusepeople so much that only about 5% of Pennsylvanians go for limited tort.I guess that's OK -- If more people opted for it, the insurancecompanies would be pushing harder for repeal.	rec.autos

However, to relate this to sports, only after I learned to not care about the score did I becomea good basketball player. I had to learn to go all out no matterthe situation. Perhaps this lesson is relevent. After all,only if I can give up my life can I keep it, only if I amhumble can I achieve glory. Only if I concentrate on livingmy life now the best I can will I be afforded life eternal.I think you have illuminated the true meaning of ""saved by faith.""But what is my answer?

There is also the possibility that lung tissue in patients with lung disease has become calcified(chest x-rays would show this).  There are side-effects to the use of EDTA because it is not specific for calcium(it also binds other minerals).  I think that there have been some deaths when EDTA chelation therapy has been used because of mineral imbalances that were not detected and corrected.  In animal studies, the best way to remove calcium from plaques in rabbits was to supplement the rabbits with vitamin C and magnesium(rabbits already synthesize their own vitamin C, the extra vitamin C was given in their diets to help the magnesium displace the calcium from the plaques).The calcification process that occurs in both plaques and the lung probably can be prevented if magnesium is used in supplemental form.  Most patietns with calcium deposits are found to be deficient in calcium.	1. ""Magnesium interrationships in ischemic heart disease: A review""	   Am J Clin Nutr 27(1):59-79(1974).  Supplementation with 	   magnesium will prevent clacification of blood vessels. 	2. ""The importance of magnesium deficiency in cardiovascular 	    disease"" Am. Heart J 94:649-57(1977).  The need to measure the 	    serum concentration in all patients with heat disease cannot be 	    overemphasized.  This is a review article.	3.

The parts aremostly independent, but you should read the first part before the rest.We don't have the time to send out missing parts by mail, so don't ask.Notes such as ``[KAH67]'' refer to the reference list in the last part.The sections of this FAQ are available via anonymous FTP to rtfm.mit.edu as /pub/usenet/news.answers/cryptography-faq/part[xx].

The NSA is the official security body of the U.S. government. It  was given its charter by President Truman in the late 40's, and  has continued research in cryptology till the present. The NSA is  known to be the largest employer of mathematicians in the world,  and is also the largest purchaser of computer hardware in the  world. Governments in general have always been prime employers of  cryptologists. The NSA probably possesses cryptographic expertise many  years ahead of the public state of the art, and can undoubtedly break  many of the systems used in practice; but for reasons of national  security almost all information about the NSA is classified.  Bamford's book [BAMFD] gives a history of the people and operations of  the NSA. The following quote from Massey [MAS88] highlights the  difference between public and private research in cryptography:  ``... if one regards cryptology as the prerogative of government,  one accepts that most cryptologic research will be conducted  behind closed doors. Without doubt, the number of workers engaged  today in such secret research in cryptology far exceeds that of  those engaged in open research in cryptology. For only about 10  years has there in fact been widespread open research in  cryptology. There have been, and will continue to be, conflicts  between these two research communities. Open research is common  quest for knowledge that depends for its vitality on the open  exchange of ideas via conference presentations and publications in  scholarly journals. But can a government agency, charged with  responsibilities of breaking the ciphers of other nations,  countenance the publication of a cipher that it cannot break? Can  a researcher in good conscience publish such a cipher that might  undermine the effectiveness of his own government's code-breakers?  One might argue that publication of a provably-secure cipher would  force all governments to behave like Stimson's `gentlemen', but one  must be aware that open research in cryptography is fraught with  political and ethical considerations of a severity than in most  scientific fields. The wonder is not that some conflicts have  occurred between government agencies and open researchers in  cryptology, but rather that these conflicts (at least those of which  we are aware) have been so few and so mild.''* What are the US export regulations?  In a nutshell, there are two government agencies which control  export of encryption software. One is the Bureau of Export  Administration (BXA) in the Department of Commerce, authorized by  the Export Administration Regulations (EAR). Another is the Office  of Defense Trade Controls (DTC) in the State Department, authorized  by the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR). As a rule  of thumb, BXA (which works with COCOM) has less stringent  requirements, but DTC (which takes orders from NSA) wants to see  everything first and can refuse to transfer jurisdiction to BXA.  The newsgroup misc.legal.computing carries many interesting  discussions on the laws surrounding cryptographic export, what  people think about those laws, and many other complex issues which  go beyond the scope of technical groups like sci.crypt. Make sure to  consult your lawyer before doing anything which will get you thrown in  jail; if you are lucky, your lawyer might know a lawyer who has at  least heard of the ITAR.* What is TEMPEST?  TEMPEST is a standard for electromagnetic shielding for computer  equipment. It was created in response to the discovery that  information can be read from computer radiation (e.g., from a CRT) at  quite a distance and with little effort.  Needless to say, encryption doesn't do much good if the cleartext  is available this way.* What are the Beale Ciphers, and are they a hoax?  (Thanks to Jim Gillogly for this information and John King for  corrections.)  The story in a pamphlet by J. B. Ward (1885) goes: Thomas  Jefferson Beale and a party of adventurers accumulated a huge mass  of treasure and buried it in Bedford County, Virginia, leaving  three ciphers with an innkeeper; the ciphers describe the  location, contents, and intended beneficiaries of the treasure.  Ward gives a decryption of the second cipher (contents) called B2;  it was encrypted as a book cipher using the initial letters of the  Declaration of Independence (DOI) as key. B1 and B3 are unsolved;  many documents have been tried as the key to B1.  Aficionados can join a group that attempts to solve B1 by various  means with an eye toward splitting the treasure:  The Beale Cypher Association  P.O. Box 975  Beaver Falls, PA 15010  You can get the ciphers from the rec.puzzles FAQL by including the  line:  send index  in a message to netlib@peregrine.com and following the directions.  (There are apparently several different versions of the cipher  floating around. The correct version is based on the 1885 pamphlet,  says John King <kingj@hpcc01.corp.hp.com>.)  Some believe the story is a hoax. Kruh [KRU88] gives a long list of  problems with the story. Gillogly [GIL80] decrypted B1 with the DOI  and found some unexpected strings, including ABFDEFGHIIJKLMMNOHPP.  Hammer (president of the Beale Cypher Association) agrees that this  string couldn't appear by chance, but feels there must be an  explanation; Gwyn (sci.crypt expert) is unimpressed with this  string.* What is the American Cryptogram Association, and how do I get in touch?  The ACA is an organization devoted to cryptography, with an emphasis  on cryptanalysis of systems that can be attacked either with  pencil-and-paper or computers. Its organ ``The Cryptogram'' includes  articles and challenge ciphers. Among the more than 50 cipher types in  English and other languages are simple substitution, Playfair,  Vigenere, bifid, Bazeries, grille, homophonic, and cryptarithm.  Dues are $15 for one year (6 issues); more outside of North America;  less for students under 18 and seniors. Subscriptions should be sent  to ACA Treasurer, 18789 West Hickory St., Mundelein, IL 60060.* Is RSA patented?  Yes. The patent number is 4,405,829, filed 12/14/77, granted 9/20/83.  For further discussion of this patent, whether it should have been  granted, algorithm patents in general, and related legal and moral  issues, see comp.patents and misc.legal.computing. For information  about the League for Programming Freedom see [FTPPF]. Note that one of  the original purposes of comp.patents was to collect questions such as  ``should RSA be patented?'', which often flooded sci.crypt and other  technical newsgroups, into a more appropriate forum.* What about the Voynich manuscript?  nelson@reed.edu (Nelson Minar) says there is a mailing list on the  subject.  the address to write to subscribe to the VMS mailing list  is: <voynich-request@rand.org>  the ftp archive is: rand.org:/pub/voynich  There's all sorts of information about the manuscript itself, of  course. A good bibliography can be found on the ftp site. Kahn's  ""The Codebreakers"" gives a good introduction."	sci.crypt

JPEG is designed for compressing eitherfull-color or gray-scale digital images of ""natural"", real-world scenes.It does not work so well on non-realistic images, such as cartoons or linedrawings.JPEG does not handle black-and-white (1-bit-per-pixel) images, nor does ithandle motion picture compression.  Standards for compressing those typesof images are being worked on by other committees, named JBIG and MPEGrespectively.JPEG is ""lossy"", meaning that the image you get out of decompression isn'tquite identical to what you originally put in.  The algorithm achieves muchof its compression by exploiting known limitations of the human eye, notablythe fact that small color details aren't perceived as well as small detailsof light-and-dark.  Thus, JPEG is intended for compressing images that willbe looked at by humans.  If you plan to machine-analyze your images, thesmall errors introduced by JPEG may be a problem for you, even if they areinvisible to the eye.A useful property of JPEG is that the degree of lossiness can be varied byadjusting compression parameters.  This means that the image maker can tradeoff file size against output image quality.  You can make *extremely* smallfiles if you don't mind poor quality; this is useful for indexing imagearchives, making thumbnail views or icons, etc. etc.  Conversely, if youaren't happy with the output quality at the default compression setting, youcan jack up the quality until you are satisfied, and accept lesser compression.[2]  Why use JPEG?There are two good reasons: to make your image files smaller, and to store24-bit-per-pixel color data instead of 8-bit-per-pixel data.Making image files smaller is a big win for transmitting files acrossnetworks and for archiving libraries of images.  Being able to compress a2 Mbyte full-color file down to 100 Kbytes or so makes a big difference indisk space and transmission time!  (If you are comparing GIF and JPEG, thesize ratio is more like four to one.  More details below.)If your viewing software doesn't support JPEG directly, you'll have toconvert JPEG to some other format for viewing or manipulating images.  Evenwith a JPEG-capable viewer, it takes longer to decode and view a JPEG imagethan to view an image of a simpler format (GIF, for instance).  Thus, usingJPEG is essentially a time/space tradeoff: you give up some time in order tostore or transmit an image more cheaply.It's worth noting that when network or phone transmission is involved, thetime savings from transferring a shorter file can be much greater than theextra time to decompress the file.  I'll let you do the arithmetic yourself.The other reason why JPEG will gradually replace GIF as a standard Usenetposting format is that JPEG can store full color information: 24 bits/pixel(16 million colors) instead of 8 or less (256 or fewer colors).  If you haveonly 8-bit display hardware then this may not seem like much of an advantageto you.  Within a couple of years, though, 8-bit GIF will look as obsolete asblack-and-white MacPaint format does today.  Furthermore, for reasons detailedin section 7, JPEG is far more useful than GIF for exchanging images amongpeople with widely varying color display hardware.  Hence JPEG is considerablymore appropriate than GIF for use as a Usenet posting standard.[3]  When should I use JPEG, and when should I stick with GIF?JPEG is *not* going to displace GIF entirely; for some types of images,GIF is superior in image quality, file size, or both.  One of the firstthings to learn about JPEG is which kinds of images to apply it to.As a rule of thumb, JPEG is superior to GIF for storing full-color orgray-scale images of ""realistic"" scenes; that means scanned photographs andsimilar material.  JPEG is superior even if you don't have 24-bit displayhardware, and it is a LOT superior if you do.  (See section 7 for details.)GIF does significantly better on images with only a few distinct colors,such as cartoons and line drawings.  In particular, large areas of pixelsthat are all *exactly* the same color are compressed very efficiently indeedby GIF.  JPEG can't squeeze these files as much as GIF does withoutintroducing visible defects.  This sort of image is best kept in GIF form.(In particular, single-color borders are quite cheap in GIF files, but theyshould be avoided in JPEG files.)JPEG also has a hard time with very sharp edges: a row of pure-black pixelsadjacent to a row of pure-white pixels, for example.  Sharp edges tend tocome out blurred unless you use a very high quality setting.  Again, thissort of thing is not found in scanned photographs, but it shows up fairlyoften in GIF files: borders, overlaid text, etc.  The blurriness isparticularly objectionable with text that's only a few pixels high.If you have a GIF with a lot of small-size overlaid text, don't JPEG it.Computer-drawn images (ray-traced scenes, for instance) usually fall betweenscanned images and cartoons in terms of complexity.  The more complex andsubtly rendered the image, the more likely that JPEG will do well on it.The same goes for semi-realistic artwork (fantasy drawings and such).Plain black-and-white (two level) images should never be converted to JPEG.You need at least about 16 gray levels before JPEG is useful for gray-scaleimages.  It should also be noted that GIF is lossless for gray-scale imagesof up to 256 levels, while JPEG is not.If you have an existing library of GIF images, you may wonder whether youshould convert them to JPEG.  You will lose a little image quality if you do.(Section 7, which argues that JPEG image quality is superior to GIF, onlyapplies if both formats start from a full-color original.  If you start froma GIF, you've already irretrievably lost a great deal of information; JPEGcan only make things worse.)  However, the disk space savings may justifyconverting anyway.  This is a decision you'll have to make for yourself.If you do convert a GIF library to JPEG, see section 14 for hints.  Beprepared to leave some images in GIF format, since some GIFs will notconvert well.[4]  How well does JPEG compress images?Pretty darn well.  Here are some sample file sizes for an image I havehandy, a 727x525 full-color image of a ship in a harbor.  The first threefiles are for comparison purposes; the rest were created with the free JPEGsoftware described in section 6B.File	   Size in bytes		Commentsship.ppm	1145040  Original file in PPM format (no compression; 24 bits			 or 3 bytes per pixel, plus a few bytes overhead)ship.ppm.Z	 963829  PPM file passed through Unix compress			 compress doesn't accomplish a lot, you'll note.			 Other text-oriented compressors give similar results.ship.gif	 240438  Converted to GIF with ppmquant -fs 256 | ppmtogif			 Most of the savings is the result of losing color			 info: GIF saves 8 bits/pixel, not 24.  (See sec. 7.)ship.jpg95	 155622  cjpeg -Q 95    (highest useful quality setting)			 This is indistinguishable from the 24-bit original,			 at least to my nonprofessional eyeballs.ship.jpg75	  58009  cjpeg -Q 75    (default setting)			 You have to look mighty darn close to distinguish this			 from the original, even with both on-screen at once.ship.jpg50	  38406  cjpeg -Q 50			 This has slight defects; if you know what to look			 for, you could tell it's been JPEGed without seeing			 the original.  Still as good image quality as many			 recent postings in Usenet pictures groups.ship.jpg25	  25192  cjpeg -Q 25			 JPEG's characteristic ""blockiness"" becomes apparent			 at this setting (djpeg -blocksmooth helps some).			 Still, I've seen plenty of Usenet postings that were			 of poorer image quality than this.ship.jpg5o	   6587  cjpeg -Q 5 -optimize  (-optimize cuts table overhead)			 Blocky, but perfectly satisfactory for preview or			 indexing purposes.  Note that this file is TINY:			 the compression ratio from the original is 173:1 !In this case JPEG can make a file that's a factor of four or five smallerthan a GIF of comparable quality (the -Q 75 file is every bit as good as theGIF, better if you have a full-color display).  This seems to be a typicalratio for real-world scenes.[5]  What are good ""quality"" settings for JPEG?Most JPEG compressors let you pick a file size vs. image quality tradeoff byselecting a quality setting.  There seems to be widespread confusion aboutthe meaning of these settings.  ""Quality 95"" does NOT mean ""keep 95% of theinformation"", as some have claimed.  The quality scale is purely arbitrary;it's not a percentage of anything.The name of the game in using JPEG is to pick the lowest quality setting(smallest file size) that decompresses into an image indistinguishable fromthe original.  This setting will vary from one image to another and from oneobserver to another, but here are some rules of thumb.The default quality setting (-Q 75) is very often the best choice.  Thissetting is about the lowest you can go without expecting to see defects in atypical image.  Try -Q 75 first; if you see defects, then go up.  Except forexperimental purposes, never go above -Q 95; saying -Q 100 will produce afile two or three times as large as -Q 95, but of hardly any better quality.If the image was less than perfect quality to begin with, you might be able togo down to -Q 50 without objectionable degradation.  On the other hand, youmight need to go to a HIGHER quality setting to avoid further degradation.The second case seems to apply much of the time when converting GIFs to JPEG.The default -Q 75 is about right for compressing 24-bit images, but -Q 85 to95 is usually better for converting GIFs (see section 14 for more info).If you want a very small file (say for preview or indexing purposes) and areprepared to tolerate large defects, a -Q setting in the range of 5 to 10 isabout right.  -Q 2 or so may be amusing as ""op art"".(Note: the quality settings discussed in this article apply to the free JPEGsoftware described in section 6B, and to many programs based on it.  OtherJPEG implementations, such as Image Alchemy, may use a completely differentquality scale.  Some programs don't even provide a numeric scale, just""high""/""medium""/""low""-style choices.)[6]  Where can I get JPEG software?Most of the programs described in this section are available by FTP.If you don't know how to use FTP, see the FAQ article ""How to find sources"".(If you don't have direct access to FTP, read about ftpmail servers in thesame article.)  That article appears regularly in news.answers, or you canget it by sending e-mail to mail-server@rtfm.mit.edu with""send usenet/news.answers/finding-sources"" in the body.  The ""Anonymous FTPList FAQ"" may also be helpful --- it's usenet/news.answers/ftp-list/faq inthe news.answers archive.NOTE: this list changes constantly.  If you have a copy more than a couplemonths old, get the latest JPEG FAQ from the news.answers archive.[6A]  If you are looking for ""canned"" software, viewers, etc:The first part of this list is system-specific programs that only run on onekind of system.  If you don't see what you want for your machine, check outthe portable JPEG software described at the end of the list.  Note that thislist concentrates on free and shareware programs that you can obtain overInternet; but some commercial programs are listed too.X Windows:XV (shareware, $25) is an excellent viewer for JPEG, GIF, and many otherimage formats.  It can also do format conversion and some simple imagemanipulations.  It's available for FTP from export.lcs.mit.edu (18.24.0.12),file contrib/xv-3.00.tar.Z.  Version 3.00 is a major upgrade with supportfor 24-bit displays and many other improvements; however, it is brand newand still has some bugs lurking.  If you prefer not to be on the bleedingedge, stick with version 2.21, also available from export.  Note thatversion 2.21 is not a good choice if you have a 24-bit display (you'll getonly 8-bit color), nor for converting 24-bit images to JPEG.  But 2.21 worksfine for converting GIF and other 8-bit images to JPEG.  CAUTION: there is aglitch in version 2.21: be sure to check the ""save at normal size"" checkboxwhen saving a JPEG file, or the file will be blurry.Another good choice for X Windows is John Cristy's free ImageMagick package,also available from export.lcs.mit.edu, file contrib/ImageMagick.tar.Z.This package handles many image processing and conversion tasks.  TheImageMagick viewer handles 24-bit displays correctly; for colormappeddisplays, it does better (though slower) color quantization than XV or thebasic free JPEG software.Both of the above are large, complex packages.  If you just want a simpleimage viewer, try xloadimage or xli.  xloadimage supports JPEG in its latestrelease, 3.03.  xloadimage is free and available from export.lcs.mit.edu,file contrib/xloadimage-3.03.tar.Z.  xli is a variant version of xloadimage,said by its fans to be somewhat faster and more robust than the original.(The current xli is indeed faster and more robust than the currentxloadimage, at least with respect to JPEG files, because it has the IJG v4decoder while xloadimage 3.03 is using a hacked-over v1.  The nextxloadimage release will fix this.)  xli is also free and available fromexport.lcs.mit.edu, file contrib/xli.1.14.tar.Z.  Both programs are saidto do the right thing with 24-bit displays.MS-DOS:This covers plain DOS; for Windows or OS/2 programs, see the next headings.One good choice is Eric Praetzel's free DVPEG, which views JPEG and GIF files.The current version, 2.5, is available by FTP from sunee.uwaterloo.ca(129.97.50.50), file pub/jpeg/viewers/dvpeg25.zip.  This is a good basicviewer that works on either 286 or 386/486 machines.  The user interface isnot flashy, but it's functional.Another freeware JPEG/GIF/TGA viewer is Mohammad Rezaei's Hiview.  Thecurrent version, 1.2, is available from Simtel20 and mirror sites (see NOTEbelow), file msdos/graphics/hv12.zip.  Hiview requires a 386 or better CPUand a VCPI-compatible memory manager (QEMM386 and 386MAX work; Windows andOS/2 do not).  Hiview is currently the fastest viewer for images that are nobigger than your screen.  For larger images, it scales the image down to fiton the screen (rather than using panning/scrolling as most viewers do).You may or may not prefer this approach, but there's no denying that itslows down loading of large images considerably.  Note: installation is abit tricky; read the directions carefully!A shareware alternative is ColorView for DOS ($30).  This is easier toinstall than either of the two freeware alternatives.  Its user interface isalso much spiffier-looking, although personally I find it harder to use ---more keystrokes, inconsistent behavior.  It is faster than DVPEG but alittle slower than Hiview, at least on my hardware.  (For images larger thanscreen size, DVPEG and ColorView seem to be about the same speed, and bothare faster than Hiview.)  The current version is 2.1, available fromSimtel20 and mirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/graphics/dcview21.zip.Requires a VESA graphics driver; if you don't have one, look in vesadrv2.zipor vesa-tsr.zip from the same directory.  (Many recent PCs have a built-inVESA driver, so don't try to load a VESA driver unless ColorView complainsthat the driver is missing.)A second shareware alternative is Fullview, which has been kicking aroundthe net for a while, but I don't know any stable archive location for it.The current (rather old) version is inferior to the above viewers anyway.The author tells me that a new version of Fullview will be out shortlyand it will be submitted to the Simtel20 archives at that time.The well-known GIF viewer CompuShow (CSHOW) supports JPEG in its latestrevision, 8.60a.  However, CSHOW's JPEG implementation isn't very good:it's slow (about half the speed of the above viewers) and image quality ispoor except on hi-color displays.  Too bad ... it'd have been nice to see agood JPEG capability in CSHOW.  Shareware, $25.  Available from Simtel20 andmirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/gif/cshw860a.zip.Due to the remarkable variety of PC graphics hardware, any one of theseviewers might not work on your particular machine.  If you can't get *any*of them to work, you'll need to use one of the following conversion programsto convert JPEG to GIF, then view with your favorite GIF viewer.  (If youhave hi-color hardware, don't use GIF as the intermediate format; try tofind a TARGA-capable viewer instead.  VPIC5.0 is reputed to do the rightthing with hi-color displays.)The Independent JPEG Group's free JPEG converters are FTPable from Simtel20and mirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/graphics/jpeg4.zip (orjpeg4386.zip if you have a 386 and extended memory).  These files are DOScompilations of the free source code described in section 6B; they willconvert JPEG to and from GIF, Targa, and PPM formats.Handmade Software offers free JPEG<=>GIF conversion tools, GIF2JPG/JPG2GIF.These are slow and are limited to conversion to and from GIF format; inparticular, you can't get 24-bit color output from a JPEG.  The majoradvantage of these tools is that they will read and write HSI's proprietaryJPEG format as well as the Usenet-standard JFIF format.  Since HSI-formatfiles are rather widespread on BBSes, this is a useful capability.  Version2.0 of these tools is free (prior versions were shareware).  Get it fromSimtel20 and mirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/graphics/gif2jpg2.zip.NOTE: do not use HSI format for files to be posted on Internet, since it isnot readable on non-PC platforms.Handmade Software also has a shareware image conversion and manipulationpackage, Image Alchemy.  This will translate JPEG files (both JFIF and HSIformats) to and from many other image formats.  It can also display images.A demo version of Image Alchemy version 1.6.2 is available from Simtel20 andmirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/graphics/alch162.zip.NOTE ABOUT SIMTEL20: The Internet's key archive site for PC-related programsis Simtel20, full name wsmr-simtel20.army.mil (192.88.110.20).  Simtel20runs a non-Unix system with weird directory names; where this documentrefers to directory (eg) ""msdos/graphics"" at Simtel20, that really means""pd1:<msdos.graphics>"".  If you are not physically on MILnet, you shouldexpect rather slow FTP transfer rates from Simtel20.  There are severalInternet sites that maintain copies (mirrors) of the Simtel20 archives;most FTP users should go to one of the mirror sites instead.  A popular USAmirror site is oak.oakland.edu (141.210.10.117), which keeps Simtel20 filesin (eg) ""/pub/msdos/graphics"".  If you have no FTP capability, you canretrieve files from Simtel20 by e-mail; see informational postings incomp.archives.msdos.announce to find out how.  If you are outside the USA,consult the same newsgroup to learn where your nearest Simtel20 mirror is.Microsoft Windows:There are several Windows programs capable of displaying JPEG images.(Windows viewers are generally slower than DOS viewers on the same hardware,due to Windows' system overhead.  Note that you can run the DOS conversionprograms described above inside a Windows DOS window.)The newest entry is WinECJ, which is free and EXTREMELY fast.  Version 1.0is available from ftp.rahul.net, file /pub/bryanw/pc/jpeg/wecj.zip.Requires Windows 3.1 and 256-or-more-colors mode.  This is a no-frillsviewer with the bad habit of hogging the machine completely while itdecodes; and the image quality is noticeably worse than other viewers.But it's so fast you'll use it anyway, at least for previewing...JView is freeware, fairly fast, has good on-line help, and can write out thedecompressed image in Windows BMP format; but it can't create new JPEGfiles, and it doesn't view GIFs.  JView also lacks some other usefulfeatures of the shareware viewers (such as brightness adjustment), but it'san excellent basic viewer.  The current version, 0.9, is available fromftp.cica.indiana.edu (129.79.20.84), file pub/pc/win3/desktop/jview090.zip.(Mirrors of this archive can be found at some other Internet sites,including wuarchive.wustl.edu.)WinJPEG (shareware, $20) displays JPEG,GIF,Targa,TIFF, and BMP image files;it can write all of these formats too, so it can be used as a converter.It has some other nifty features including color-balance adjustment andslideshow.  The current version is 2.1, available from Simtel20 and mirrorsites (see NOTE above), file msdos/windows3/winjp210.zip.  (This is a slow286-compatible version; if you register, you'll get the 386-only version,which is roughly 25% faster.)ColorView is another shareware entry ($30).  This was an early and promisingcontender, but it has not been updated in some time, and at this point ithas no real advantages over WinJPEG.  If you want to try it anyway, thecurrent version is 0.97, available from ftp.cica.indiana.edu, filepub/pc/win3/desktop/cview097.zip.  (I understand that a new version willbe appearing once the authors are finished with ColorView for DOS.)DVPEG (see DOS heading) also works under Windows, but only in full-screenmode, not in a window.OS/2:The following files are available from hobbes.nmsu.edu (128.123.35.151).Note: check /pub/uploads for more recent versions --- the hobbes moderatoris not very fast about moving uploads into their permanent directories./pub/os2/2.x/graphics/jpegv4.zip    32-bit version of free IJG conversion programs, version 4./pub/os2/all/graphics/jpeg4-16.zip    16-bit version of same, for OS/2 1.x./pub/os2/2.x/graphics/imgarc12.zip    Image Archiver 1.02: image conversion/viewing with PM graphical interface.    Strong on conversion functions, viewing is a bit weaker.  Shareware, $15./pub/os2/2.x/graphics/pmjpeg11.zip    PMJPEG 1.1: OS/2 2.x port of WinJPEG, a popular viewer for Windows    (see description in Windows section).  Shareware, $20./pub/os2/2.x/graphics/pmview85.zip    PMView 0.85: JPEG/GIF/BMP/Targa/PCX viewer.  GIF viewing very fast,    JPEG viewing roughly the same speed as the above two programs.  Has    image manipulation & slideshow functions.  Shareware, $20.Macintosh:Most Mac JPEG programs rely on Apple's JPEG implementation, which is part ofthe QuickTime system extension; so you need to have QuickTime installed.To use QuickTime, you need a 68020 or better CPU and you need to be runningSystem 6.0.7 or later.  (If you're running System 6, you must also installthe 32-bit QuickDraw extension; this is built-in on System 7.)  You can getQuickTime by FTP from ftp.apple.com, file dts/mac/quicktime/quicktime.hqx.(As of 11/92, this file contains QuickTime 1.5, which is better than QT 1.0in several ways.  With respect to JPEG, it is marginally faster andconsiderably less prone to crash when fed a corrupt JPEG file.  However,some applications seem to have compatibility problems with QT 1.5.)Mac users should keep in mind that QuickTime's JPEG format, PICT/JPEG, isnot the same as the Usenet-standard JFIF JPEG format.  (See section 10 fordetails.)  If you post images on Usenet, make sure they are in JFIF format.Most of the programs mentioned below can generate either format.The first choice is probably JPEGView, a free program for viewing imagesthat are in JFIF format, PICT/JPEG format, or GIF format.  It also canconvert between the two JPEG formats.  The current version, 2.0, is a bigimprovement over prior versions.  Get it from sumex-aim.stanford.edu(36.44.0.6), file /info-mac/app/jpeg-view-20.hqx.  Requires System 7 andQuickTime.  On 8-bit displays, JPEGView usually produces the best colorimage quality of all the currently available Mac JPEG viewers.  JPEGView canview large images in much less memory than other Mac viewers; in fact, it'sthe only one that can deal with JPEG images much over 640x480 pixels on atypical 4MB Mac.  Given a large image, JPEGView automatically scales it downto fit on the screen, rather than presenting scroll bars like most otherviewers.  (You can zoom in on any desired portion, though.)  Some peoplelike this behavior, some don't.  Overall, JPEGView's user interface is verywell thought out.GIFConverter, a shareware ($40) image viewer/converter, supports JFIF andPICT/JPEG, as well as GIF and several other image formats.  The latestversion is 2.3.2.  Get it from sumex-aim.stanford.edu, file/info-mac/art/gif/gif-converter-232.hqx.  Requires System 6.0.5 or later.GIFConverter is not better than JPEGView as a plain JPEG/GIF viewer, butit has much more extensive image manipulation and format conversioncapabilities, so you may find it worth its shareware fee if you do a lot ofplaying around with images.  Also, the newest version of GIFConverter canload and save JFIF images *without* QuickTime, so it is your best bet ifyour machine is too old to run QuickTime.  (But it's faster with QuickTime.)Note: If GIFConverter runs out of memory trying to load a large JPEG, tryconverting the file to GIF with JPEG Convert, then viewing the GIF version.JPEG Convert, a Mac version of the free IJG JPEG conversion utilities, isavailable from sumex-aim.stanford.edu, file /info-mac/app/jpeg-convert-10.hqx.This will run on any Mac, but it only does file conversion, not viewing.You can use it in conjunction with any GIF viewer.Previous versions of this FAQ recommended Imagery JPEG v0.6, a JPEG<=>GIFconverter based on an old version of the IJG code.  If you are using thisprogram, you definitely should replace it with JPEG Convert.Apple's free program PictPixie can view images in JFIF, QuickTime JPEG, andGIF format, and can convert between these formats.  You can get PictPixiefrom ftp.apple.com, file dts/mac/quicktime/qt.1.0.stuff/pictpixie.hqx.Requires QuickTime.  PictPixie was intended as a developer's tool, and it'sreally not the best choice unless you like to fool around with QuickTime.Some of its drawbacks are that it requires lots of memory, it producesrelatively poor color image quality on anything less than a 24-bit display,and it has a relatively unfriendly user interface.  Worse, PictPixie is anunsupported program, meaning it has some minor bugs that Apple does notintend to fix.  (There is an old version of PictPixie, calledPICTCompressor, floating around the net.  If you have this you should trashit, as it's even buggier.  Also, the QuickTime Starter Kit includes a muchcleaned-up descendant of PictPixie called Picture Compressor.  Note thatPicture Compressor is NOT free and may not be distributed on the net.)Storm Technology's Picture Decompress is a free JPEG viewer/converter.This rather old program is inferior to the above programs in many ways, butit will run without System 7 or QuickTime, so you may be forced to use it onolder systems.  (It does need 32-bit QuickDraw, so really old machines can'tuse it.)  You can get it from sumex-aim.stanford.edu, file/info-mac/app/picture-decompress-201.hqx.  You must set the file type of adownloaded image file to 'JPEG' to allow Picture Decompress to open it.If your machine is too old to run 32-bit QuickDraw (a Mac Plus for instance),GIFConverter is your only choice for single-program JPEG viewing.  If youdon't want to pay for GIFConverter, use JPEG Convert and a free GIF viewer.More and more commercial Mac applications are supporting JPEG, although notall can deal with the Usenet-standard JFIF format.  Adobe Photoshop, version2.0.1 or later, can read and write JFIF-format JPEG files (use the JPEGplug-in from the Acquire menu).  You must set the file type of a downloadedJPEG file to 'JPEG' to allow Photoshop to recognize it.Amiga:(Most programs listed in this section are stored in the AmiNet archive atamiga.physik.unizh.ch (130.60.80.80).  There are many mirror sites of thisarchive and you should try to use the closest one.  In the USA, a goodchoice is wuarchive.wustl.edu; look under /mirrors/amiga.physik.unizh.ch/...)HamLab Plus is an excellent JPEG viewer/converter, as well as being ageneral image manipulation tool.  It's cheap (shareware, $20) and can readseveral formats besides JPEG.  The current version is 2.0.8.  A demo versionis available from amiga.physik.unizh.ch (and mirror sites), fileamiga/gfx/edit/hamlab208d.lha.  The demo version will crop images largerthan 512x512, but it is otherwise fully functional.Rend24 (shareware, $30) is an image renderer that can display JPEG, ILBM,and GIF images.  The program can be used to create animations, evencapturing frames on-the-fly from rendering packages like Lightwave.  Thecurrent version is 1.05, available from amiga.physik.unizh.ch (and mirrorsites), file amiga/os30/gfx/rend105.lha.  (Note: although this directory issupposedly for AmigaDOS 3.0 programs, the program will also run underAmigaDOS 1.3, 2.04 or 2.1.)Viewtek is a free JPEG/ILBM/GIF/ANIM viewer.  The current version is 1.04,available from amiga.physik.unizh.ch (and mirror sites), fileamiga/gfx/show/ViewTek104.lha.If you're willing to spend real money, there are several commercial packagesthat support JPEG.  Two are written by Thomas Krehbiel, the author of Rend24and Viewtek.  These are CineMorph, a standalone image morphing package, andImageFX, an impressive 24-bit image capture, conversion, editing, painting,effects and prepress package that also includes CineMorph.  Both aredistributed by Great Valley Products.  Art Department Professional (ADPro),from ASDG Inc, is the most widely used commercial image manipulationsoftware for Amigas.  ImageMaster, from Black Belt Systems, is anotherwell-regarded commercial graphics package with JPEG support.The free IJG JPEG software is available compiled for Amigas fromamiga.physik.unizh.ch (and mirror sites) in directory amiga/gfx/conv, fileAmigaJPEGV4.lha.  These programs convert JPEG to/from PPM,GIF,Targa formats.The Amiga world is heavily infested with quick-and-dirty JPEG programs, manybased on an ancient beta-test version of the free IJG JPEG software (thanksto a certain magazine that published same on its disk-of-the-month, withoutso much as notifying the authors).  Among these are ""AugJPEG"", ""NewAmyJPEG"",""VJPEG"", and probably others I have not even heard of.  In my opinion,anything older than IJG version 3 (March 1992) is not worth the disk spaceit's stored on; if you have such a program, trash it and get something newer.Atari ST:The free IJG JPEG software is available compiled for Atari ST, TT, etc,from atari.archive.umich.edu, file /atari/Graphics/jpeg4bin.zoo.These programs convert JPEG to/from PPM, GIF, Targa formats.For monochrome ST monitors, try MGIF, which manages to achieve four-levelgrayscale effect by flickering.  Version 4.1 reads JPEG files.  Availablefrom atari.archive.umich.edu, file /atari/Graphics/mgif41b.zoo.I have not heard of any other free or shareware JPEG-capable viewers forAtaris, but surely there must be some by now?  Pointers appreciated.Acorn Archimedes:!ChangeFSI, supplied with RISC OS 3 version 3.10, can convert from and viewJPEG JFIF format.  Provision is also made to convert images to JPEG,although this must be done from the CLI rather than by double-clicking.Recent versions (since 7.11) of the shareware program Translator can handleJPEG, along with about 30 other image formats.  While older versions can befound on some Archimedes bboards, the current version is only available byregistering with the author, John Kortink, Nutterbrink 31, 7544 WJ, Enschede,The Netherlands.  Price 35 Dutch guilders (about $22 or 10 pounds).There's also a commercial product called !JPEG which provides JPEG read/writefunctionality and direct JPEG viewing, as well as a host of other imageformat conversion and processing options.  This is more expensive but notnecessarily better than the above programs.  Contact: DT Software, FREEPOST,Cambridge, UK.  Tel: 0223 841099.NeXT:ImageViewer is a PD utility that displays images and can do some formatconversions.  The current version reads JPEG but does not write it.ImageViewer is available from the standard NeXT archives atsonata.cc.purdue.edu and cs.orst.edu, somewhere in /pub/next (both arecurrently being re-organized, so it's hard to point to specificsub-directories).  Note that there is an older version floating around thatdoes not support JPEG.Portable software for almost any system:If none of the above fits your situation, you can obtain and compile the freeJPEG conversion software described in 6B.  You'll also need a viewer program.If your display is 8 bits or less, any GIF viewer will do fine; if you have adisplay with more color capability, try to find a viewer that can read Targaor PPM 24-bit image files.There are numerous commercial JPEG offerings, with more popping up everyday.  I recommend that you not spend money on one of these unless you findthe available free or shareware software vastly too slow.  In that case,purchase a hardware-assisted product.  Ask pointed questions about whetherthe product complies with the final JPEG standard and about whether it canhandle the JFIF file format; many of the earliest commercial releases arenot and never will be compatible with anyone else's files.[6B]  If you are looking for source code to work with:Free, portable C code for JPEG compression is available from the IndependentJPEG Group, which I lead.  A package containing our source code,documentation, and some small test files is available from several places.The ""official"" archive site for this source code is ftp.uu.net (137.39.1.9or 192.48.96.9).  Look under directory /graphics/jpeg; the current releaseis jpegsrc.v4.tar.Z.  (This is a compressed TAR file; don't forget toretrieve in binary mode.)  You can retrieve this file by FTP or UUCP.If you are on a PC and don't know how to cope with .tar.Z format, you mayprefer ZIP format, which you can find at Simtel20 and mirror sites (see NOTEabove), file msdos/graphics/jpegsrc4.zip.  This file will also be available onCompuServe, in the GRAPHSUPPORT forum (GO PICS), library 15, as jpsrc4.zip.If you have no FTP access, you can retrieve the source from your nearestcomp.sources.misc archive; version 4 appeared as issues 55-72 of volume 34.(If you don't know how to retrieve comp.sources.misc postings, see the FAQarticle ""How to find sources"", referred to at the top of section 6.)The free JPEG code provides conversion between JPEG ""JFIF"" format and imagefiles in GIF, PBMPLUS PPM/PGM, Utah RLE, and Truevision Targa file formats.The core compression and decompression modules can easily be reused in otherprograms, such as image viewers.  The package is highly portable; we havetested it on many machines ranging from PCs to Crays.We have released this software for both noncommercial and commercial use.Companies are welcome to use it as the basis for JPEG-related products.We do not ask a royalty, although we do ask for an acknowledgement inproduct literature (see the README file in the distribution for details).We hope to make this software industrial-quality --- although, as withanything that's free, we offer no warranty and accept no liability.The Independent JPEG Group is a volunteer organization; if you'd like tocontribute to improving our software, you are welcome to join.[7]  What's all this hoopla about color quantization?Most people don't have full-color (24 bit per pixel) display hardware.Typical display hardware stores 8 or fewer bits per pixel, so it can display256 or fewer distinct colors at a time.  To display a full-color image, thecomputer must map the image into an appropriate set of representativecolors.  This process is called ""color quantization"".  (This is somethingof a misnomer, ""color selection"" would be a better term.  We're stuck withthe standard usage though.)Clearly, color quantization is a lossy process.  It turns out that for mostimages, the details of the color quantization algorithm have MUCH more impacton the final image quality than do any errors introduced by JPEG (except atthe very lowest JPEG quality settings).Since JPEG is a full-color format, converting a color JPEG image for displayon 8-bit-or-less hardware requires color quantization.  This is true for*all* color JPEGs: even if you feed a 256-or-less-color GIF into JPEG, whatcomes out of the decompressor is *not* 256 colors, but thousands of colors.This happens because JPEG's lossiness affects each pixel a littledifferently, so two pixels that started with identical colors will probablycome out with slightly different colors.  Each original color gets ""smeared""into a group of nearby colors.  Therefore quantization is always required todisplay a color JPEG on a colormapped display, regardless of the imagesource.  The only way to avoid quantization is to ask for gray-scale output.(Incidentally, because of this effect it's nearly meaningless to talk aboutthe number of colors used by a JPEG image.  Even if you attempted to countthe number of distinct pixel values, different JPEG decoders would give youdifferent results because of roundoff error differences.  I occasionally seeposted images described as ""256-color JPEG"".  This tells me that the poster(a) hasn't read this FAQ and (b) probably converted the JPEG from a GIF.JPEGs can be classified as color or gray-scale (just like photographs), butnumber of colors just isn't a useful concept for JPEG.)On the other hand, a GIF image by definition has already been quantized to256 or fewer colors.  (A GIF *does* have a definite number of colors in itspalette, and the format doesn't allow more than 256 palette entries.)For purposes of Usenet picture distribution, GIF has the advantage that thesender precomputes the color quantization, so recipients don't have to.This is also the *disadvantage* of GIF: you're stuck with the sender'squantization.  If the sender quantized to a different number of colors thanwhat you can display, you have to re-quantize, resulting in much poorerimage quality than if you had quantized once from a full-color image.Furthermore, if the sender didn't use a high-quality color quantizationalgorithm, you're out of luck.For this reason, JPEG offers the promise of significantly better image qualityfor all users whose machines don't match the sender's display hardware.JPEG's full color image can be quantized to precisely match the user's displayhardware.  Furthermore, you will be able to take advantage of futureimprovements in quantization algorithms (there is a lot of active research inthis area), or purchase better display hardware, to get a better view of JPEGimages you already have.  With a GIF, you're stuck forevermore with what wassent.It's also worth mentioning that many GIF-viewing programs include rathershoddy quantization routines.  If you view a 256-color GIF on a 16-color EGAdisplay, for example, you are probably getting a much worse image than youneed to.  This is partly an inevitable consequence of doing two colorquantizations (one to create the GIF, one to display it), but often it'salso due to sloppiness.  JPEG conversion programs will be forced to usehigh quality quantizers in order to get acceptable results at all, and innormal use they will quantize directly to the number of colors to bedisplayed.  Thus, JPEG is likely to provide better results than the averageGIF program for low-color-resolution displays as well as high-resolution ones!Finally, an ever-growing number of people have better-than-8-bit displayhardware already: 15-bit ""hi-color"" PC displays, true 24-bit displays onworkstations and Macintoshes, etc.  For these people, GIF is alreadyobsolete, as it cannot represent an image to the full capabilities of theirdisplay.  JPEG images can drive these displays much more effectively.Thus, JPEG is an all-around better choice than GIF for representing imagesin a machine-independent fashion.[8]  How does JPEG work?The buzz-words to know are chrominance subsampling, discrete cosinetransforms, coefficient quantization, and Huffman or arithmetic entropycoding.  This article's long enough already, so I'm not going to say morethan that here.  For technical information, see the comp.compression FAQ.This is available from the news.answers archive at rtfm.mit.edu, in files/pub/usenet/news.answers/compression-faq/part[1-3].  If you need help inusing the news.answers archive, see the top of this article.[9]  What about lossless JPEG?There's a great deal of confusion on this subject.  The JPEG committee diddefine a truly lossless compression algorithm, i.e., one that guarantees thefinal output is bit-for-bit identical to the original input.  However, thislossless mode has almost nothing in common with the regular, lossy JPEGalgorithm, and it offers much less compression.  At present, very fewimplementations of lossless JPEG exist, and all of them are commercial.Saying ""-Q 100"" to the free JPEG software DOES NOT get you a lossless image.What it does get rid of is deliberate information loss in the coefficientquantization step.  There is still a good deal of information loss in thecolor subsampling step.  (With the V4 free JPEG code, you can also say""-sample 1x1"" to turn off subsampling.  Keep in mind that many commercialJPEG implementations cannot cope with the resulting file.)Even with both quantization and subsampling turned off, the regular JPEGalgorithm is not lossless, because it is subject to roundoff errors invarious calculations.  The maximum error is a few counts in any one pixelvalue; it's highly unlikely that this could be perceived by the human eye,but it might be a concern if you are doing machine processing of an image.At this minimum-loss setting, regular JPEG produces files that are perhapshalf the size of an uncompressed 24-bit-per-pixel image.  True lossless JPEGprovides roughly the same amount of compression, but it guaranteesbit-for-bit accuracy.If you have an application requiring lossless storage of images with lessthan 6 bits per pixel (per color component), you may want to look into theJBIG bilevel image compression standard.  This performs better than JPEGlossless on such images.  JPEG lossless is superior to JBIG on images with6 or more bits per pixel; furthermore, JPEG is public domain (at least with aHuffman back end), while the JBIG techniques are heavily covered by patents.[10]  Why all the argument about file formats?Strictly speaking, JPEG refers only to a family of compression algorithms;it does *not* refer to a specific image file format.  The JPEG committee wasprevented from defining a file format by turf wars within the internationalstandards organizations.Since we can't actually exchange images with anyone else unless we agree ona common file format, this leaves us with a problem.  In the absence ofofficial standards, a number of JPEG program writers have just gone off to""do their own thing"", and as a result their programs aren't compatible withanybody else's.The closest thing we have to a de-facto standard JPEG format is some workthat's been coordinated by people at C-Cube Microsystems.  They have definedtwo JPEG-based file formats:  * JFIF (JPEG File Interchange Format), a ""low-end"" format that transports    pixels and not much else.  * TIFF/JPEG, aka TIFF 6.0, an extension of the Aldus TIFF format.  TIFF is    a ""high-end"" format that will let you record just about everything you    ever wanted to know about an image, and a lot more besides :-).  TIFF is    a lot more complex than JFIF, and may well prove less transportable,    because different vendors have historically implemented slightly different    and incompatible subsets of TIFF.  It's not likely that adding JPEG to the    mix will do anything to improve this situation.Both of these formats were developed with input from all the major vendorsof JPEG-related products; it's reasonably likely that future commercialproducts will adhere to one or both standards.I believe that Usenet should adopt JFIF as the replacement for GIF inpicture postings.  JFIF is simpler than TIFF and is available now; theTIFF 6.0 spec has only recently been officially adopted, and it is stillunusably vague on some crucial details.  Even when TIFF/JPEG is welldefined, the JFIF format is likely to be a widely supported ""lowest commondenominator""; TIFF/JPEG files may never be as transportable.A particular case that people may be interested in is Apple's QuickTimesoftware for the Macintosh.  QuickTime uses a JFIF-compatible format wrappedinside the Mac-specific PICT structure.  Conversion between JFIF andQuickTime JPEG is pretty straightforward, and several Mac programs areavailable to do it (see Mac portion of section 6A).  If you have an editorthat handles binary files, you can strip a QuickTime JPEG PICT down to JFIFby hand; see section 11 for details.Another particular case is Handmade Software's programs (GIF2JPG/JPG2GIF andImage Alchemy).  These programs are capable of reading and writing JFIFformat.  By default, though, they write a proprietary format developed byHSI.  This format is NOT readable by any non-HSI programs and should not beused for Usenet postings.  Use the -j switch to get JFIF output.  (Thisapplies to old versions of these programs; the current releases emit JFIFformat by default.  You still should be careful not to post HSI-formatfiles, unless you want to get flamed by people on non-PC platforms.)[11]  How do I recognize which file format I have, and what do I do about it?If you have an alleged JPEG file that your software won't read, it's likelyto be HSI format or some other proprietary JPEG-based format.  You can tellwhat you have by inspecting the first few bytes of the file:1.  A JFIF-standard file will start with the characters (hex) FF D8 FF E0,    followed by two variable bytes (often hex 00 10), followed by 'JFIF'.2.  If you see FF D8 at the start, but not the rest of it, you may have a    ""raw JPEG"" file.  This is probably decodable as-is by JFIF software ---    it's worth a try, anyway.3.  HSI files start with 'hsi1'.  You're out of luck unless you have HSI    software.  Portions of the file may look like plain JPEG data, but they    won't decompress properly with non-HSI programs.4.  A Macintosh PICT file, if JPEG-compressed, will have a couple hundred    bytes of header followed by a JFIF header (scan for 'JFIF').  Strip off    everything before the FF D8 and you should be able to read it.5.  Anything else: it's a proprietary format, or not JPEG at all.  If you are    lucky, the file may consist of a header and a raw JPEG data stream.    If you can identify the start of the JPEG data stream (look for FF D8),    try stripping off everything before that.In uuencoded Usenet postings, the characteristic JFIF pattern is	""begin"" line	M_]C_X ...whereas uuencoded HSI files will start with	""begin"" line	M:'-I ...If you learn to check for the former, you can save yourself the trouble ofdownloading non-JFIF files.[12]  What about arithmetic coding?The JPEG spec defines two different ""back end"" modules for the final outputof compressed data: either Huffman coding or arithmetic coding is allowed.The choice has no impact on image quality, but arithmetic coding usuallyproduces a smaller compressed file.  On typical images, arithmetic codingproduces a file 5 or 10 percent smaller than Huffman coding.  (All thefile-size numbers previously cited are for Huffman coding.)Unfortunately, the particular variant of arithmetic coding specified by theJPEG standard is subject to patents owned by IBM, AT&T, and Mitsubishi.Thus *you cannot legally use arithmetic coding* unless you obtain licensesfrom these companies.  (The ""fair use"" doctrine allows people to implementand test the algorithm, but actually storing any images with it is dubiousat best.)At least in the short run, I recommend that people not worry aboutarithmetic coding; the space savings isn't great enough to justify thepotential legal hassles.  In particular, arithmetic coding *should not*be used for any images to be exchanged on Usenet.There is some small chance that the legal situation may change in thefuture.  Stay tuned for further details.[13]  Does loss accumulate with repeated compression/decompression?It would be nice if, having compressed an image with JPEG, you coulddecompress it, manipulate it (crop off a border, say), and recompress itwithout any further image degradation beyond what you lost initially.Unfortunately THIS IS NOT THE CASE.  In general, recompressing an alteredimage loses more information, though usually not as much as was lost thefirst time around.The next best thing would be that if you decompress an image and recompressit *without changing it* then there is no further loss, i.e., you get anidentical JPEG file.  Even this is not true; at least, not with the currentfree JPEG software.  It's essentially a problem of accumulation of roundofferror.  If you repeatedly compress and decompress, the image will eventuallydegrade to where you can see visible changes from the first-generationoutput.  (It usually takes many such cycles to get visible change.)One of the things on our to-do list is to see if accumulation of error canbe avoided or limited, but I am not optimistic about it.In any case, the most that could possibly be guaranteed would be thatcompressing the unmodified full-color output of djpeg, at the originalquality setting, would introduce no further loss.  Even such simple changesas cropping off a border could cause further roundoff-error degradation.(If you're wondering why, it's because the pixel-block boundaries move.If you cropped off only multiples of 16 pixels, you might be safe, butthat's a mighty limited capability!)The bottom line is that JPEG is a useful format for archival storage andtransmission of images, but you don't want to use it as an intermediateformat for sequences of image manipulation steps.  Use a lossless format(PPM, RLE, TIFF, etc) while working on the image, then JPEG it when you areready to file it away.  Aside from avoiding degradation, you will save a lotof compression/decompression time this way :-).[14]  What are some rules of thumb for converting GIF images to JPEG?As stated earlier, you *will* lose some amount of image information if youconvert an existing GIF image to JPEG.  If you can obtain the originalfull-color data the GIF was made from, it's far better to make a JPEG fromthat.  But if you need to save space and have only the GIF to work from,here are some suggestions for getting maximum space savings with minimumloss of quality.The first rule when converting a GIF library is to look at each JPEG, tomake sure you are happy with it, before throwing away the corresponding GIF;that will give you a chance to re-do the conversion with a higher qualitysetting if necessary.  Some GIFs may be better left as GIFs, as explained insection 3; in particular, cartoon-type GIFs with sixteen or fewer colorsdon't convert well.  You may find that a JPEG file of reasonable qualitywill be *larger* than the GIF.  (So check the sizes too.)Experience to date suggests that large, high-visual-quality GIFs are the bestcandidates for conversion to JPEG.  They chew up the most storage so offerthe most potential savings, and they convert to JPEG with least degradation.Don't waste your time converting any GIF much under 100 Kbytes.  Also, don'texpect JPEG files converted from GIFs to be as small as those createddirectly from full-color originals.  To maintain image quality you may haveto let the converted files be as much as twice as big as straight-throughJPEG files would be (i.e., shoot for 1/2 or 1/3rd the size of the GIF file,not 1/4th as suggested in earlier comparisons).Many people have developed an odd habit of putting a large constant-colorborder around a GIF image.  While useless, this was nearly free in terms ofstorage cost in GIF files.  It is NOT free in JPEG files, and the sharpborder boundary can create visible artifacts (""ghost"" edges).  Do yourselfa favor and crop off any border before JPEGing.  (If you are on an X Windowssystem, XV's manual and automatic cropping functions are a very painlessway to do this.)cjpeg's default Q setting of 75 is appropriate for full-color input, butfor GIF inputs, Q settings of 85 to 95 often seem to be necessary to avoidimage degradation.  (If you apply smoothing as suggested below, the higherQ setting may not be necessary.)Color GIFs of photographs or complex artwork are usually ""dithered"" to foolyour eye into seeing more than the 256 colors that GIF can actually store.If you enlarge the image, you will see that adjacent pixels are often ofsignificantly different colors; at normal size the eye averages these pixelstogether to produce the illusion of an intermediate color value.  Thetrouble with dithering is that, to JPEG, it looks like high-spatial-frequencycolor noise; and JPEG can't compress noise very well.  The resulting JPEGfile is both larger and of lower image quality than what you would havegotten from JPEGing the original full color image (if you had it).To get around this, you want to ""smooth"" the GIF image before compression.Smoothing averages together nearby pixels, thus approximating the color thatyou thought you saw anyway, and in the process getting rid of the rapidcolor changes that give JPEG trouble.  Appropriate use of smoothing willoften let you avoid using a high Q factor, thus further reducing the size ofthe compressed file, while still obtaining a better-looking output imagethan you'd get without smoothing.With the V4 free JPEG software (or products based on it), a simple smoothingcapability is built in.  Try ""-smooth 10"" or so when converting GIFs.Values of 10 to 25 seem to work well for high-quality GIFs.  Heavy-handeddithering may require larger smoothing factors.  (If you can see regularfine-scale patterns on the GIF image even without enlargement, then strongsmoothing is definitely called for.)  Too large a smoothing factor will blurthe output image, which you don't want.  If you are an image processingwizard, you can also do smoothing with a separate filtering program, such aspnmconvol from the PBMPLUS package.  However, cjpeg's built-in smoother isa LOT faster than pnmconvol...The upshot of all this is that ""cjpeg -quality 85 -smooth 10"" is probably agood starting point for converting GIFs.  But if you really care about theimage, you'll want to check the results and maybe try a few other settings.---------------------For more information about JPEG in general or the free JPEG software inparticular, contact the Independent JPEG Group at jpeg-info@uunet.uu.net.-- 			tom lane			organizer, Independent JPEG GroupInternet: tgl@cs.cmu.edu	BITNET: tgl%cs.cmu.edu@carnegie"	comp.graphics

This is an improvedversion anyway so no loss the first time.  HL}The standard work on detecting forgeries of ancient documents is probably the writing of Friedrich Blass, ""Hermeneutrik und Kritik,"" _Einleitende und Hilfsdisziplinen_, vol 1 of_Handbuch der Klassischen Altertums- wissenshaft_ (Noerdlingen:Beck, 1886).  Portions of this are described in Nibley, _The Prophetic Book op Mormon_, pp 219-242 (SLC:  Deseret Book, 1989).(If you want to attempt reading this be forewarned.  Nibleydescribes Blass as a typical German scholar who claims littleknowledge of his subject, then proceeds to exhaust both the subjectand the reader.)  Nibley's extract from Blass's work is in the formof ""rules for forgers.""  It makes interesting reading.I confess that I have not read Blass's work, only Nibley's extractthereof.  My German falls far short of what would be required andas far as I know there is no English translation available.  However,I believe the techniques he describes are known widely enough that any competent classical scholar could examine a purportedly ancientdocument and at least determine if it is consistent with what one would expect of a genuine document of that time frame.  We will not be able to prove who wrote it but at least we should be able to determine with reasonable confidence if it is from that time and culture or is a later forgery.Actually there are 2 types of purportedly ancient documents:1.  Alleged actual holographs or early copies thereof.  For examplethe Dead Sea Scrolls.  These can be tested by various scientificmeans to determine the age of the paper, inks, and objects foundwith them.  This can provide a pretty clear dating of the actualphysical objects.2.  Documents claiming to be copies of ancient works although thecopy itself may be much more recent.  For example we might find adocument which monks in a monastary claim is a copy of somethingfrom centuries ago (perhaps even having been through severalgenerations of copists).  This is more of a problem but can still be tested (although the test is not likely to be simple).  We cannotexpect a test of the age of the physical objects to tell us much sowe must confine our testing to the text itself.It is important to remember that none of these tests can tell us ifthe document is really what it claims to be.  They can only date thedocument and identify its culture of origin.  For example I've heardof a letter supposed to have been written by Jesus himself to a kingin what is now Iraq.  If this document were to actually turn upscholars could date the paper and ink (assuming they have theholograph).  They could check the language, content and writingstyle to see if they are consistent with what would be expected of aPalestinian Jew of that time.  However even if all test results werepositive there is no way to determine if Jesus himself actuallywrote it.  We would know what time and culture it came from but(barring a known sample of Jesus handwriting or other clues for comparison) scholarship must stop there.  There is seldom any way todetermine who the actual author was.As I say, I'm no expert on Blas's work.  I do remember some of thetests which can be applied to alleged copies of ancient works.  Specifically we might ask:1.  Is the document internally consistent?  Does it contradictitself?  If the work it is short it would be relatively easy to maintain internal consistency, even if it is a forgery.  The longer the forgery the more difficult it is to maintain consistency.For this reason most successful forgers stick to short documents.2.  Is it consistent with the history and geography of the time?Again a short, non-specific work might not be testable but if thewriting is of any significant length no latter-day forger would beable to escape detection.  Here we look for the minor, inconspicuousthings which someone from that culture would get right without eventhinking about it but which a later forger would find too numerous and trivial to check.  The devil is in the details.3.  What about the literary style of the work, figures of speechetc.  Any ancient writer would almost certainly speak in ways that seem strange to us.  Are there any such odd phrases in this book?  If so do they fit in with the culture?Of course there are complications if the document has beentranslated, or possibly even if somebody just updated languagewhen he copied it.  A few cases of language not from the cultureclaimed may be allowed in recent copies.  They cause problems andreduce certainty to be sure but don't necessarily prove forgery.These tests can be quite effective (given enough material to work with) but they are not easy.  They require the skills of the historian, the linguist, the anthropologist etc.  The questions to ask are, ""Is every aspect of this document consistent with what we know about the culture of claimed origin?""  If there are things which don't fit how significant are they?  Are problem areas due toour lack of knowledge, later changes by copists or are they really significant?  There will often be some ambiguity since we neverknow everything about the culture.The end result of any such testing is occasionally certain(particularly in the case of holographs or other ancient copies).However often it may just be a probability or an indication thatthe document (or maybe parts of it) is probably authentic (orsometimes maybe other parts are later additions).  This is often unsettling to a generation raised on TV where all problems aresolved in 30 to 60 minutes with time out for commercials.  It is, however, the real world and what scholarship has to offer."	soc.religion.christian

Their neighbours thought they were a littlestrange but all in all the kind of people you would want to livenext door to.One version has the BATF serving a *search* warrant by jumping outof a horse trailer with guns and tossing concussion grenades.  Ifthis is the true order of events then the 'cult' could not knowthat a search warrant was being served and since there was no proofthat these guys were police,  the 'cult' had every right to defendthemselves.: Torching themselves shows briliant tactics, and convinces me: they *realy* belong in society ...If you watch actual footage of the fire from start to finish itis not at all clear that fire wasn't started by the tanks.  Thepeople who survived are claiming that the fire was started bythe tanks knocking over some kerosene lanterns.  The FBI isclaiming that the 'cult' started the fire.'they *realy* belong in society' is a catchy phrase butI'm personally waiting to see what the Texas Rangers have to sayabout it all before I pass judgment.   Why don't you do the same.Some more interesting facts about the Waco incident:1)  The original assault was conducted by BATF officers wearing    an assorted types of camouflage.  I saw, on CNN, at least    three different types.   I would be hard pressed to identify    a bunch of guys in 'bring-your-own' battle fatigues as    uniformed officers of the law even if they were claiming to    be police.    2)  The BATF has been lying from the beginning:    + ""We only had handguns"" - the original footage showed 4 BATF      officers on a roof top getting shot at,  one had an MP-5      assault sub-machine gun.    + ""We were out gunned"" - sub-machine guns and shotguns are the      BEST in quarters weapon,  you can't be out gunned when you      have the best guns available for the job.    + ""We didn't know they had guns that would shoot through doors!"" -      this one is the best,  there are very few guns that won't shoot      through a household door,  or through a house WALL for that      matter.  Since officers from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and      *Firearms* should know that,  they are either lying or incredibly      incompetent.  Not to mention criminally negligent if they are      shooting bullets that they think will stop when the encounter      plywood.    + ""We had a search warrant.  Actually, we had an arrest warrant.       No, wait,  we had both.  Yeah, that's the ticket.       Oh, and they're child molesters too.  And they make *drugs*.       Did we mention we think they have rocket launchers.""      - The story from BATF and FBI spokespeople has changed daily      and their claims were getting increasingly outrageous.      3)  Throughout the siege the FBI and BATF have be claiming that one    of their biggest concerns was that Koresh and his followers would    mass suicide.   Now they are claiming that that's what he did    AND that they are surprised that he did.

As a Latter-day Saint, I believe that all of us (you,me, etc.) lived once as spirit-children of God the Father (Hebrews 12:9)in the pre-mortal existance. In order to continue our eternal progression,an earthly probationary time was required.  (To live by faith, not bysight, to choose good over evil, and to prepare ourselves in all thingsto become worthy of a higher order of existance.)  We believe that all ofGod's spirit-offspring were once assembled to discuss the specifics ofthis earthly sojourn.  One-third chose for Lucifer's plan, most followedthe Firstborn (the pre-mortal Jesus Christ).  Lucifer's aspirations (""Iwill exalt my throne above the stars of God . . ."" Isaiah 14:12-17, etc.)resulted into the rebellion of his followers against the Firstborn andthose who followed Him, resulting in the casting out of Lucifer (whobecame Satan, the father of lies) and one-third of the hosts of heaven(""And his tail drew the third part of the stars of heaven, and did castthem to the earth . . ."" Revelation 12:4) as demons (evil spirits).To get back on OUR choice to be born on this earth, and to be subject toGod and His plan (for good or bad, based upon our obedience and choices),we made that choice individually.  (God speaking to Job: ""Where wast thouwhen I laid the foundations of the earth, . . . when the morning starssang together, and all the sons of God shouted for joy?"" Job 38:4-7).  Welost the knowledge of our pre-mortal existance (the ""Veil of Forgetful-ness,"" somewhere in Psalms), in order to live by faith, not by sight.You may not accept this scenario, neither do quite a few who rely on theBible alone, which offers only fragmentary insights into this particularaspect of our existence as individuals, as sons and daughters of God.#Who is god to impose its rules on us ? Who can tell if god is REALLY so#righteous as god likes us to believe? Are all christians a flock of sheep,#unable to do otherwise that follow the rest?##Hmmmmmmmmmmmm.(All Christians, by definition, ARE a flock of sheep, following the Shepherdas they understand Him  ;-)  --But in any event, not all Christians believein the same theology, such as the one Latter-day Saints believe in.  (Theywill cry ""heresy"" and other accusations of ""perverting"" the doctrines ofthe Bible, while they themselves believe in a myriad of interpretations, asfound in their catechisms and various do-it-yourself Bible-study manuals...)As for me, I have a personal conviction that the pre-existance scenario asexplained above, is most in harmony with Biblical doctrine, some Dead SeaScroll books, the pseudographion, other (Jewish) sources, and last but notleast, modern-day revelation on the subject.#I just want to point out that this is not sarcasm, I mean it.##                        How should one deal with a man who is convinced that#                        he is acting according to God's will, and who there-#     Jokke              fore believes that he is doing you a favour by#                        stabbing you in the back?##                                                        -VoltaireCasper C.

V.32bis is most definitely *NOT* aproprietary modulation scheme.>The Sportster will do>asynchronous transmissions as well as synchronous.  The HST is one way>only.I do hope you didn't mean for these two sentences to be related in someway.....first off, V.32 and V.32bis are both synchronous and asynchronous.  this ispart of the CCITT Recommendation (i.e., part of the standard).  it isn't afeature unique to the Sportster (I just looked at the appropriate chapterin the Courier DS manual).second, HST is not ``one way only.''  more correctly put, it is anasymmetrical modulation scheme, meaning it doesn't work at the same speedin both directions.  HST operates at [9.6 / 14.4 / 16.8] in one direction,and has a low-speed back-channel in the other direction.  the high-speedchannel goes in the direction of the higher data flow.  this is fine ifyou're logged on to say, a BBS, and type one letter and get screens ofinfo back, transfer files (not using bimodem), etc....  there is, of course,a penalty for turnaround time when the high-speed channel needs to reversedirections.V.32 and V.32bis are both symmetrical, meaning they do transfer the fulldata rate in both directions at the same time.third, synchronous vs asynchronous has absolutely nothing to do withsymmetrical vs asymmetrical...they are two completely different topics.>The HST's will be upgradeable to the v.fast spec when it is available.again, more correctly put, *SOME* of the Courier line will be upgradeableto whatever ``V.fast'' is called when it's complete.  if you have the largefootprint Courier modems (like I do), you're S.O.L.....  there was anupgrade plan a while back to upgrade to a small footprint variety, whichcould eventually be upgraded to support V.fast, but the cost of the twoupgrades together pretty much put it higher than just buying a new modem.later.....   --jim--#include <std_disclaimer.h>                                 73 DE N5IAL (/4)------------------------------------------------------------------------------INTERNET: jim@n5ial.mythical.com  |  j.graham@ieee.org     ICBM: 30.23N 86.32WAMATEUR RADIO: n5ial@w4zbb (Ft.

The Contracting Parties confirm that genocide, whethercommitted in time of peace or in time of war, is a crime under international law which they undertake to prevent and to punish.Article 2. In the present Convention genocide means any of thefollowing acts committed with intent to destroy, in whole orin part, a national, ethnical, racial or religious group, as such:A) Killing member of the group;B) Causing serious bodily or mental harm to members of the group;C) Deliberately inflicting on the group conditions of life    calculated to bring about its physical destruction in whole    or in part;D) Imposing measures intended to prevent births within the group;E) Forcibly transferring children of the group to another group;Article 3. The following acts shall be punishable:a) Genocideb) Conspiracy to commit genocidec) Direct and public incitement to commit genocided) Attempt to commit genocide.Article 4. Persons committing genocide or any of the other actsenumerated in Article 3 shall be punished, whether they areconstitutionally responsible rulers, public officials or privateindividuals.Had the Convention on Genocide existed before the Armenian massacres of the Turks and Kurds, it would probably have been difficult for the x-Soviet Armenian Government and its responsiblesto start murdering of civilian, defenseless, faithful Ottomancitizens, children and women, (GENOCIDE AND ATTEMPT TO GENOCIDE),to make plans to exterminate, as they have done also to Urartusand Jews, faithful Ottoman citizens (CONSPIRACY TO COMMIT GENOCIDE), to incite Armenians to armed revolt against the legal authorityand to commit Genocide, (DIRECT AND PUBLIC INCITEMENT TO COMMITGENOCIDE).Serdar Argic                           'We closed the roads and mountain passes that                             might serve as ways of escape for the Turks                             and then proceeded in the work of extermination.'

Iread his ""Satanic Bible"" a few years ago for a social studies project,as well as a book by Arthur Lyons called ""The Cult of Devil Worshipin America.""  The latter included a very interesting interview withthe Black Pope in which he did indeed say that Satan was merely aninstrument for one to realize the self.  When I refer to Satanism, I am referring to the mishmash of rural Satanicritualism and witchcraft which existed before the Church of Satan.  Idon't consider LaVey's church to be at all ""orthodox,"" nor do I considerits followers ""satanists.""  LaVey combined the philosophies of Nietzsche,Crowley, and Reich, slapped in some religious doctrine, added a littletouch of P.T. Barnum, and christened his creation the Church of Satan.No doubt the title was a calculated attempt to attract attention...Isuppose he could have just as easily called it the Church of Free Sex.At any rate, it worked (for a while).  In its heyday, the Church had ahuge following, including such Hollywood celebrities as Sammy Davis, Jr.and Jayne Mansfield.  (I have a picture of LaVey with Sammy, by the way.)  I find the idea of a Satanist not believing in Satan about as credible asa Christian not believing in Christ.  But if you include the Church ofSatan, then I suppose I need to alter my definition.

Unlike me, he thinks that our friends in        the US enjoy the same freedom that we do, and he has not seen        the slow but steady erosion to the south of us.        We have the benefit of relatively slow politicians and        ineffective law enforcement. Our rednecks tend to be the        objects of derision rather than elected officials. It's        everything LE can do to keep up with the real criminals. Any        time they actually go after somebody just because they don't        like his or her attitude, it's national news (It also often        blows up in their faces: eg. the well-intentioned but flawed        Zundel case, which resulted in a scolding from the Supreme        Court, not only to LE for prosecuting the case but to        Parliament for passing the law it was prosecuted under).        Our friends south of the border don't have as easy a time of        it. Among other things they have as many LE agencies as we        have agencies, and some of them have teeth. They also have the        War on Drugs which gives law-enforcement agencies exceptional        powers to ignore individuals' rights (the DEA has more        arbitrary power than that given to Canadian agencies under the        War Measures Act). We have the RCMP and CSIS who can't stop        fighting each other long enough to do any really effective        suppression of private citizens' rights. Not only that, our        Police Commissions have teeth, as I learned when I had to fend        off a bent cop.

"Newsgroup:comp.sys.ibm.pc.hardwaredocument_id: 60275From: sherwood@adobe.com (Geoffrey Sherwood)Subject: Orchid P9000 vs Fahrenheit (mini review)I just purchased a Viewsonic 17 and and Orchid P9000.  In short, I am happywith the monitor and unhappy with the card.  I have spent a lot more timefutzing with the card, so that is what I am going to write about.  The monitoris pretty.  The moires I had under Simcity on my 17"" Magnavox went away.  Itisn't as heavy as I thought it would be (45 lbs, I think).  So much for themonitor.  On to the bitch session and test results.In going with the modern trend, the Orchid P9000 card only supports 16 colorsin 640x480 mode without a driver.  Of course, this breaks any DOS programwhich uses SVGA modes (like most of my CD-ROMs).  The Compudyne Whiplash VGA,Orchid Fahrenheit 1280, and Orchid F. VLB all share this limitation.  Thoseare all S3 cards, which means it is an S3 problem for them (the P9000 usesa Weitek VGA chip which also doesn't support them).  The Hercules Graphitecard does seem to have these modes, but I didn't run the same test cases asI did on the other boards during the brief time I had it.  It was able toprint the splash screen for the Grolier's Encyclopedia, though, which the S3cards just printed as hash, which is why I suspect the SVGA modes are supported.The supported resolutions really annoy me.  You can do 1280x1024 at 75Hz ifyou tell the driver you have an NEC 5FG (they only have about six monitorslisted plus 'Generic', and if you choose Generic you can't get any highrefreshes at ALL).  But at 1024x768 you are limited to 70Hz.  Seems to methat the hardware should be able to support the bandwidth (if it can do 75Hzat 1280 it sure should be able to do it at 1024!).  Higher vertical resolutionwas the main reason I bought the card over the Orchid F. VLB I currently have,and it will do 1024x768x70 Hz as well.The higher graphics modes all crash HP Dashboard.  I just got off the phonewith Orchid, and with the 1.1 drivers (I don't know what I have) he was unableto recreate the problem.  On the plus side, their tech rep was as helpful ashe could be and booted up the program on his computer to verify he didn't havethe problem.  He didn't know why they limited the refresh to 70 Hz either.The board is faster that the OFVLB for most things according to the HerculesSpeedy program. This program tests various operations and reports the resultsin pixels/second.  I don't have the numbers for the Graphite card, but theywere close to half of the OFVLB (ie, slower) but that was running in a 20MHz386, ISA, so the numbers aren't really comparable.  The following numberswere all obtained using a 486, 33 MHz, AIR motherboard (UMC chipset), with8 MB memory.

I have no idea what is being done internally as far asconversions go.  The memory to screen takes the same face and copies it tothe screen, my guess is after it has been rasterized into a bitmap that canjust be copied to the video display.  The screen to screen test copies thatface from place to place on the screen.  Awesome!  Interestingly, the solidvectors and shaded polygons show no improvement, and hatched polygons (ie,filled with cross-hatching) and Ternary Rops (whatever they are.  Graphicsoperations like XORs maybe????) are a dead loss on the 9000.  I give twonumbers for the 9000 fonts, because I think they are caching.When the fonts are first drawn on the screen they are done fairly slowly --1/3 the speed of the OFVLB.  Then the speed increases dramatically.  Soundslike programming to a benchmark to me....I make no claims that these numbers mean anything at all.  Its just whatI saw when I ran them on my computer.  I normally don't write disclaimers,but this time maybe I'd better.

This proposal to establish a secret government designedcryptography chip with government key registration as the standard for voiceencryption is very disturbing. The idea that citizens must register their secrets with the government just in case they are trying to keep them secret is patently unAmerican. Additionally, the press release for this programstrongly implied that other forms of cryptography would be banned after the Clipper Chip standard is in place. This latest attack on our civil rights is deeply disturbing and is frankly a voting issue for me. The presidents press release stated that the plan strikes a balance between thelegitimate needs of law enforcement and a citizens right to privacy but this is not the case. The fact is that since other strong cryptographic equipment is avalible the criminals, drug dealers and terrorists mentioned in the press release will simply use non clipper cryptography. Meanwhile the average citizenmay gain no protection against warentless wiretaps by the government since the government escrowed key is derived deterministicly from the unit serial numberwhich is broadcast by the chip durring its opperation. This seems like an obvious back door for the NSA and law enforcement. If you still do nott understand my objection to key registration, consider the way J. Edgar Hoover blackmailed government officials like yourself; would you now use a phone to transmit personal details of your life that the NSA and FBI have the keys to?______________________________________________________________________________Well heres a letter, I didnt spell check it since I dont know how in EMACSso you might want to do that.

Ithink I had to change some constants in the dpg-view sources to make ituse the ET4k modes.VGAlib's sources seem to be designed for easy addition of new Super VGAsupport; each mode is an array of register values and there's a programthat dumps an array declaration of this kind describing the currentmode. Haven't tried it though...(Btw, my version of VGAlib is 1.2.)-- kennu@mits.mdata.fiTry Linux, a free UNIX by Linus Torvalds for 386+'s.

None of this is clear.I can't speak for Mr. Cavano, but I understood his comment to refer to the idea that unrecognized pantheism is dangerous to Christians.  If we unthinkingly adopt pantheistic ideas that are opposed to Christianity, we can pervert our faith.  When we clearly recognize pantheism when we encounter it we have the opportunity to embrace what is consistent with Christianity and reject what isn't.    We need to be alert, always thinking and questioning.  We must examine the underlying assumptions of every book we read, tv program we watch and socio-political movement we participate in.  Ideas are important.  Philosophies and doctrines are what give form to the events of our lives.  They are the basis from which we live our lives of love and service.

How much closer to the source can you get?The Greek in 2 Timothy which is sometimes translated as ""inspired by God"", literally means ""God-breathed"".  In other words, God spoke the actual words into the scriptures.  Many theologians and Bible scholars (Dr. James Boice is one that I can remember off-hand) get quite annoyed by the dryness and incompleteness of ""inspired by God"".>The only way you would be able to escape this notion of>     ""second-hand"" info is to have had the entire Bible>     written by God himself.

In conclusion, be careful about logically unfounded hypotheses basedon gut feelings about the text and other scholars' unsubstantiated claims.  The Bible pleads that we take it in its entirety or throw the whole book out.	About your reading of the Bible, not only does the Spirit inspire thewriters, but he guides the reader as well.

I think your question should be rephrased. The manyverses of the Bible which condem homosexuality (by our beliefs) have beenshoved down the throats of homosexuals for a long time by (well-meaning?)Christians. The question is how do they interpret these verses. Any discussionof any issue (this or any other issue) requires a proof of your case as wellas a disproof of the opposing view. We are already familiar with those versesand many have proven to themselves that these condem homosexual behaviour. Wemust now establish reasons for not believing this to be true based on theinterpretation of these scriptures given by someone who has come to grips withthem.Todd...	soc.religion.christian

However,I've talked to some people who have said that it will only work if youare lucky - i.e. if the cop happens to point his laser at a car infront of you, and the laser beam happens to reflect back to yourdetector.  Otherwise it won't work.  Regular radar, of course, travelsin all directions; hence it is more detectable.  Any comments?Escort has a deal (till the end of April, I think), where if you buytheir wideband (Passport 3200 - X, K, Ka) and laser detectors, you'llsave $60 off of buying them separately.

If he didn't help us win the AL east, forgetabout the pennent and the world series.His run support was high (5.98 runs) but so was Stottlemyer's (5.90 runs)and he won only 12 games.  I do remember Morris winning an inordinate number of6-5 and 8-6 ballgames, but this is to his credit.  He pitched only as goodas he needed to be.  When he was up 6-1 in a ballgame, he just put it in cruisecontrol and threw the ball up there and let the batters ""get themseleves out""(I hate this expression!).  An inexperienced pitcher would wear himself out trying to make perfect pitches to keep his era down.  But Morris, being a veteran pitcher, knows that winning is the only thing that really matters inbaseball.  By saving himself, he was able to reach back for that little extra(I hate this too!) when the game was on the line.Yes Morris is crapping out big time this year, but let's not change historyto suit the present.  BTW, I think he should be put in the bullpen; it would be embarrassing a veteran pitcher which Cito would never do, but his era is 17+, how much morecan he be embarrassed?> > From where I sit, I'll let others have the excellent players - I'll> settle for good enough and the ring :-)ditto!> > Joe Leonard> jle@world.std.com> eddie"	rec.sport.baseball

This directory can be used for things likearticles by Kates, Wright, Tonso, Levinson, Supreme Court Decisions,the RIA vs US decision, copies of legislation, and so on.  It's notmeant to be for the discussions that normally appear here.So, in the future if you're looking for something check there firstand then ask here.Instructions:Short version for techies:The site is godiva.nectar.cs.cmu.edu.  Place contributions into thedirectory /usr0/anon/pub/firearms/politics/rkba.  The ftp commandsget, put, mget, or mput should work.  Give the command ""type binary""to be sure files are transferred correctly.  Your files will be movedto the rkba directory.  To get a file use the commands get or mget.I will maintain an index which you should get first to check ifthe file you want to read or write already is archived.Long version for non-techies:In order for you to use this archive your computer must be onthe Internet.  To connect to the archive site run the command:	ftp godiva.nectar.cs.cmu.eduIf that doesn't work you cannot use this archive.  If the ftpcommand is successful you'll get this prompt asking you for alogin:	Name (godiva.nectar.cs.cmu.edu:lvc):Instead of lvc your initials will appear.  Answer this prompt with:	ftpNext you'll get this prompt asking your for your e-mail address:	Guest login ok, send e-mail address as password:I would enter:	l.v.cipriani@att.comYou'll enter your own e-mail address.  You'll get these linesor similar as output:	Remote system is UNIX.	Using binary mode to transfer files.Next, the command prompt is printed:	ftp> If you do not get the line ""Using binary mode to transfer files.""Run the command:	type binaryNow you're logged in to the archive machine.  There are manydirectories on this machine  but the two you are concerned with are	/usr0/anon/pub/firearms/politics/rkbaand	/usr0/anon/pub/firearms/politics/incomingThere are subdirectories to the rkba directory, those are discussed below.When you login to the system your directory is /usr0/anon.  To retreivefiles change your current directory to the rkba directory with the command:	cd /usr0/anon/pub/firearms/politics/rkbaor	cd pub/firearms/politics/rkbaTo submit files change your directory to the incoming directory withthe command:	cd /usr0/anon/pub/firearms/politics/incomingor	cd pub/firearms/politics/incomingOnce you do this you'll get another ftp> prompt asking you to enteranother command.To find the names of the existing files in the directory you arein run the command:	ls -lThis will produce something like:total 6021-r--r--r--  1 karl          6932 Jun 16  1992 DMN_Gratia_CCP-r--r--r--  1 karl         69149 Apr  5 19:20 INDEX-r--r--r--  1 karl         18965 Jun 16  1992 Knox_AW_lies-r--r--r--  1 karl         10930 Apr 30  1992 S361-r--r--r--  1 karl          8958 Jun 16  1992 WSJ_Crimestrike-r--r--r--  1 karl          2649 Jan 13 18:33 academia-bias-r--r--r--  1 karl           935 Mar 22 22:38 academics-r--r--r--  1 karl         36079 Aug  4  1992 aclu... and so on ...Each line corresponds to one file.  Reading right to left, the fieldsare the file name, the last modification date of the file, the size ofthe file in bytes, and some permission fields which you do not needto be concerned with.To get a file run the command ""get"" followed by the name of the fileyou want, for example:	get INDEXor	get nodutyAfter the file is transfered to your machine a message like this:	Transfer complete.	19580 bytes received in 5 seconds (4 Kbytes/s)You can repeat the get command for every file you want to retreive.You can use the mget command to retreive multiple files.  If thefile you want is in a subdirectory, for example, congress/103rd/HR1025you should change your directory to the appropriate subdirectory firstand then retrieve it:	cd congress/103rd	get HR1025Once you're finished you can log off with the command:	quitIf you have a file you want to contribute the procedure is a littledifferent.  First of all you should find out if the file alreadyexists, so get a copy of the index file with the procedure aboveand look it over to make sure you wouldn't repeat an entry.  Theindex will have a description of each of the files in the rkbadirectory.  For example:----------------------------------------------------------------------File: whitemanslawWhite Man's Law by William R. Tonso, from the December 1985Reason magazine----------------------------------------------------------------------Once you've determined you won't be duplicating an entry, loginand change to the incoming directory command (see above).  Onceyou are in the incoming directory use the command:	put file_nameIn this case:	put whitemanslawAgain there'll be a ""Transfer complete, so many bytes transferedin so many seconds"" message.  Now your file is on the archivemachine.Another thing to watch out for is duplicate file /names/.  Be surethere isn't a file in the incoming directory that is called the sameas the file you want to write.  If you use the same name you'lloverwrite the previous file [or you'll get an error message].Your file may have to be renamed if there is a conflict with afile by the same name in the rkba directory.Once your file is in the incoming directory send me an entry forthe INDEX file and I will add it to the file.If you cannot use anonymous ftp and would still like to contributea file email the file to me and I'll take care of the rest.If you submit a file and do not notify me it may be removed, sobe sure to let me know first.If you have any questions feel free to ask me.------------------------------------------------------------------------ Larry Cipriani -- l.v.cipriani@att.com-- Michael Phelps, (external) mjp@vnet.ibm.com ..

Most of the C preprocessors that	I have used will not treat such a # as appearing at the start of the	line.  Thus the C preprocessor does not treat the hash symbol as the	start of a directive. 	However the IBM cpp strips the comment and treats the hash symbol	as the start of a directive.  The cpp fails when it determines	that ""This"" is not a known directive.  I have temporarily hacked my	imake to handle this situation but would like to come up with a better	fix.(2) Several Imakefiles use /**/ as a parameter to a macro when a particular	use of the macro does not need a value for the parameter.  The AIX cpp	gives warnings about these situations but continues to work OK.If you are familiar with these problems and have solutions, I would appreciateinformation about on your solutions.

The only thing that has happened is that the two sides have exchanged roles.The USA has a higher imprisonment rate (400 per 100,000 population)than any country in Europe by a factor of 10 or so.  In California,it is over 600 per 100,000 population.  The prison population inCalifornia is now over 100,000, a quadrupling since 1980.  Most ofthese inmates were convicted under the drug prohibition laws.  Policenow confiscate property, without trial, under a ""good faith probablecause"" standard, in the name of depriving the horrible ghastly drugdealers of their ill-gotten gains.  Conduct an opinion poll, and amajority will answer ""yes"" if you ask them whether civil liberties anddue process should be diluted in order to Send Our Young People TheMessage That We Are Serious About Winning The War On Drugs.  I don'tknow whether anyone has measured such a figure among gun owners, butI would expect the same result.  They certainly seem to vote that way.According to Jack Herer's book _The Emperor Wears No Clothes_, overTWELVE MILLION YEARS of prison time have been served under themarijuana prohibition laws, by people who were minding their ownbusiness and causing no harm to others (and less harm to themselvesthan users of tobacco, with 400,000 confirmed kills/year).  Underthe ""War on Drugs"" campaign of ""zero tolerance"" due process protectionshave eroded, and mandatory sentences of ten years without parole haveproliferated.  By and large, gun owners have voted for the politicianswho favor such measures.  And now, all the precedents--not onlylegal, but political:  ""My fellow Americans, we must send our youngpeople the message that we are serious about winning the War OnMurder""--are going to be applied to the oncoming wave of gunprohibition laws.  Gun owners are about to get a taste of the medicinethey voted for believing it would be used only on those with differenttastes in recreational drugs.What goes around comes around.    Alan T.

One of them is the ERA statistic for: pitchers. What does it say ??ERA indicates the average number of earned runs attributed to a pitcher pernine inning game.  Thus, if a pitcher pitched 3 innings and gave up 1 earnedrun, his 9 inning equivelent perfomance would be 3 earned runs, thus his ERAis 3.00.  To compute the ERA you simply take the number of earned runs dividedby the innings pitched and then multiple the result by 9.	ERA = (ER/IP) * 9An earned run is run that is given up by the pitcher that is not attributedto a fielding error.  More specifically, if an error occurs that representedthe third out, all runs scored after the error are considered UNEARNED runs.Earned runs are also runs scored as a result of players who were left on basewhen the pitcher exited the game.  Here are some examples:	If there are two outs in an inning and there are men on base.  If	an error occurs that represents the third out, all of the runs after	this error and NOT counted as earned runs.	If a pitcher issues some base on balls (walks), and leaves the game	before the inning is completed, he is responsible for the people who	were left on base.  If the those runners who were left on base score,	and the score was not a result of an error, those eraned runs are	attributed to the pitcher who left the game.I hope this explains things for you.

I agree with the gentlemen who wrote the comment before me.The important thing is pick what ever interest you the most and learn as much as possible about it.  	In my five years of education in this field, though brief compare to alot of people, I had to think about this kind of question a lot.  Did I make the right decision in going intoElectrical Engineering as opposed to Computer engineering orCS?  The more I go thru school, the more I believe that thiskind of question is irrelevant.   	I have come to believe that choosing CS because one does not like hardware or choosing hardware because one doesnot like to program is really doing an injustice of buildingand computer and making it useful for something.  Everythingis interwoven and inseparable.  CS, CE, and EE are all a part of a really great discipline and do depend on each other.	My advice is don't limit yourself, but make a decisionbased on which major will give you the best opportunities to learn.  That of course depends on the curriculum at your persective school.  I would choose a major that allows me toexplore as much as possible.  Beside, I don't know why theschool would make a student choose a major before her/hissophamore year.                  	Hey you may be so interested in this field that you decided to learn all about the making of computers in which case, you suffer a little more and go to grad school.	About the money.  Don't look at the averages, if youare good, you are going to earn more money than anyone else. If you are a superstar programmer, you will earn millions.

""Khons, the son of the great goddess-mother, seems to have been gernaerallyrepresented as a full-grown god. The Babylonian divinity was also representedvery frequently in Egupt in the very same wayas in the land of his nativity-i.e. as a child in his mother's arems.  THis was the way in which Osiris, 'theson, the husband of his mother,' was often exhibited, and what we learn of thisgod, equally as in the case of Khonso, shows that in his original he was noneother than Nimrod.  It is admitted that the secret system of Free Masonry wasoriginally founded on the Mysteries of the Egyptian Isis, the goddess-mother,or wife of Osiris.  But what could have led to the union of a Masonic body withthese Mysteries, had they not had particular reference to architecture, and hadthe god who was worshipped in them not been celebrated for his success inperfecting the arts of fortification and building?  Now, if such were the case,considering the relation in which, as we have already seen, Egypt stood toBabylon, who would naturally be liiked up to there as the great patron of theMasonic art?  The strong presumption is, that Nimrod must have been the man. He was the first that gained faim in this way.  As the child of the Babyloniangoddess-mother, he was worshipped in the character of Ala mahozim, 'The God ofFortification.'  Osiris, the child of the Egyptian Modonna, was equallycelebrated as 'the strong chief of the buildings.'  THis strong chief of thebuildings was origninally worshipped in Egypt with every physicallcharacteristic of Nimrod.  I have already noticed the fact that Nimrod, as theson of Cush, was a negro.  Now, there was a tradition in Egypt, recorded byPlutarch, that 'Osiris was black'.......""  HislopIt was like a cold slap to my face, when my wifes uncle brought out hiscerimonial dress and it was leopard skin.  I mean real leopard skin.   He toldme that only the highest of degrees wore the leopard skin.  (The reason that hestarted telling me all this was that he had just been given a couple of monthsto live and my wife had led him to a saving faith in Christ and he immediatelyrepented from 'mysteries' of the lodge!)Nimr-rod from Nimr, a ""leopard,"" and rada or rad ""To subdue.""  It is auniversal principle in all idolatries, that the high priest wears the insigniaof the god he serves.  Any representation of Osiris usually show the wearing ofsome leopard.  It is interesting that the Druids of Britian also show, orshould I say hide, this representation.  They, however, worshipped the ""spottedcow"".I'll stand by my statements.  Masonry is of the ""mystery"" religions that allfind their source in Babylon, the great harlot. Sorry Peter,  I do not mean tobe a ""cold slap to the face"" but there is to much evidence to the contrary thatMasonry doesn't find its origins in Egypt.  Of the Masons I have personallytalked to, all refered to Egypt as their origin.

"Newsgroup:sci.cryptdocument_id: 15290From: pat@rwing.UUCP (Pat Myrto)Subject: New Clipper Chip Proposal from the Guv...I saw this article posted in a local newsgroup.  I haven't seen it,or any followup traffic relating to it in these groups or other groupswhich I subscribe to.  So, I am posting it here so others can read it,check it out, and comment on it, and provide ideas for handling thesesorts of things.I have no verification to the accuracy or lack of accuracy of thisarticle, but if accurate, I find it extremely disturbing, especially inlight of various abuses of the SSN number regarding privacy, (I understandit is now to be required in CA to renew a drivers license, or to registera car) and other proposals regarding 'smart' national Identity Cards,wiretap proposals, and such.  One simply wonders what other gems are inthe wings ready to be sprung on the people by our government.  Perhapssuggestions and ideas for preventing this and other such proposals fromacquiring the force of law would be useful.  The cost simply outweighsany possible benefits, IMO.BTW, reading this makes me think of some ideas a Prof Denning has beenpromoting, in an even more disturbing form.That said, with no further comment, the article follows:------------ Begin included article ---------Note:  This file will also be available via anonymous filetransfer from csrc.ncsl.nist.gov in directory /pub/nistnews andvia the NIST Computer Security BBS at 301-948-5717.     ---------------------------------------------------                         THE WHITE HOUSE                  Office of the Press Secretary_________________________________________________________________For Immediate Release                           April 16, 1993                STATEMENT BY THE PRESS SECRETARYThe President today announced a new initiative that will bringthe Federal Government together with industry in a voluntaryprogram to improve the security and privacy of telephonecommunications while meeting the legitimate needs of lawenforcement.The initiative will involve the creation of new products toaccelerate the development and use of advanced and securetelecommunications networks and wireless communications links.For too long there has been little or no dialogue between ourprivate sector and the law enforcement community to resolve thetension between economic vitality and the real challenges ofprotecting Americans.  Rather than use technology to accommodatethe sometimes competing interests of economic growth, privacy andlaw enforcement, previous policies have pitted government againstindustry and the rights of privacy against law enforcement.Sophisticated encryption technology has been used for years toprotect electronic funds transfer.  It is now being used toprotect electronic mail and computer files.  While encryptiontechnology can help Americans protect business secrets and theunauthorized release of personal information, it also can be usedby terrorists, drug dealers, and other criminals.A state-of-the-art microcircuit called the ""Clipper Chip"" hasbeen developed by government engineers.  The chip represents anew approach to encryption technology.  It can be used in new,relatively inexpensive encryption devices that can be attached toan ordinary telephone.  It scrambles telephone communicationsusing an encryption algorithm that is more powerful than many incommercial use today.This new technology will help companies protect proprietaryinformation, protect the privacy of personal phone conversationsand prevent unauthorized release of data transmittedelectronically.  At the same time this technology preserves theability of federal, state and local law enforcement agencies tointercept lawfully the phone conversations of criminals. A ""key-escrow"" system will be established to ensure that the""Clipper Chip"" is used to protect the privacy of law-abidingAmericans.  Each device containing the chip will have two unique                                2""keys,"" numbers that will be needed by authorized governmentagencies to decode messages encoded by the device.  When thedevice is manufactured, the two keys will be deposited separatelyin two ""key-escrow"" data bases that will be established by theAttorney General.  Access to these keys will be limited togovernment officials with legal authorization to conduct awiretap.The ""Clipper Chip"" technology provides law enforcement with nonew authorities to access the content of the privateconversations of Americans.To demonstrate the effectiveness of this new technology, theAttorney General will soon purchase several thousand of the newdevices.  In addition, respected experts from outside thegovernment will be offered access to the confidential details ofthe algorithm to assess its capabilities and publicly reporttheir findings.The chip is an important step in addressing the problem ofencryption's dual-edge sword:  encryption helps to protect theprivacy of individuals and industry, but it also can shieldcriminals and terrorists.  We need the ""Clipper Chip"" and otherapproaches that can both provide law-abiding citizens with accessto the encryption they need and prevent criminals from using itto hide their illegal activities.  In order to assess technologytrends and explore new approaches (like the key-escrow system),the President has directed government agencies to develop acomprehensive policy on encryption that accommodates:     --   the privacy of our citizens, including the need to          employ voice or data encryption for business purposes;     --   the ability of authorized officials to access telephone          calls and data, under proper court or other legal          order, when necessary to protect our citizens;     --   the effective and timely use of the most modern          technology to build the National Information          Infrastructure needed to promote economic growth and          the competitiveness of American industry in the global          marketplace; and      --   the need of U.S. companies to manufacture and export          high technology products.The President has directed early and frequent consultations withaffected industries, the Congress and groups that advocate theprivacy rights of individuals as policy options are developed.                                3The Administration is committed to working with the privatesector to spur the development of a National InformationInfrastructure which will use new telecommunications and computertechnologies to give Americans unprecedented access toinformation.  This infrastructure of high-speed networks(""information superhighways"") will transmit video, images, HDTVprogramming, and huge data files as easily as today's telephonesystem transmits voice.Since encryption technology will play an increasingly importantrole in that infrastructure, the Federal Government must actquickly to develop consistent, comprehensive policies regardingits use.  The Administration is committed to policies thatprotect all Americans' right to privacy while also protectingthem from those who break the law.Further information is provided in an accompanying fact sheet. The provisions of the President's directive to acquire the newencryption technology are also available.  For additional details, call Mat Heyman, National Institute ofStandards and Technology, (301) 975-2758.---------------------------------QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ABOUT THE CLINTON ADMINISTRATION'STELECOMMUNICATIONS INITIATIVEQ:   Does this approach expand the authority of government     agencies to listen in on phone conversations?A:   No.  ""Clipper Chip"" technology provides law enforcement with     no new authorities to access the content of the private     conversations of Americans.Q:   Suppose a law enforcement agency is conducting a wiretap on     a drug smuggling ring and intercepts a conversation     encrypted using the device.  What would they have to do to     decipher the message?A:   They would have to obtain legal authorization, normally a     court order, to do the wiretap in the first place.  They     would then present documentation of this authorization to     the two entities responsible for safeguarding the keys and     obtain the keys for the device being used by the drug     smugglers.  The key is split into two parts, which are     stored separately in order to ensure the security of the key     escrow system.Q:   Who will run the key-escrow data banks?A:   The two key-escrow data banks will be run by two independent     entities.  At this point, the Department of Justice and the     Administration have yet to determine which agencies will     oversee the key-escrow data banks.Q:   How strong is the security in the device?  How can I be sure     how strong the security is?  A:   This system is more secure than many other voice encryption     systems readily available today.  While the algorithm will     remain classified to protect the security of the key escrow     system, we are willing to invite an independent panel of     cryptography experts to evaluate the algorithm to assure all     potential users that there are no unrecognized     vulnerabilities.Q:   Whose decision was it to propose this product?A:   The National Security Council, the Justice Department, the     Commerce Department, and other key agencies were involved in     this decision.  This approach has been endorsed by the     President, the Vice President, and appropriate Cabinet     officials.Q:   Who was consulted?  The Congress?  Industry?A:   We have on-going discussions with Congress and industry on     encryption issues, and expect those discussions to intensify     as we carry out our review of encryption policy.  We have     briefed members of Congress and industry leaders on the     decisions related to this initiative.Q:   Will the government provide the hardware to manufacturers?A:   The government designed and developed the key access     encryption microcircuits, but it is not providing the     microcircuits to product manufacturers.  Product     manufacturers can acquire the microcircuits from the chip     manufacturer that produces them.Q:   Who provides the ""Clipper Chip""?A:   Mykotronx programs it at their facility in Torrance,     California, and will sell the chip to encryption device     manufacturers.  The programming function could be licensed     to other vendors in the future.Q:   How do I buy one of these encryption devices? A:   We expect several manufacturers to consider incorporating     the ""Clipper Chip"" into their devices.     Q:   If the Administration were unable to find a technological     solution like the one proposed, would the Administration be     willing to use legal remedies to restrict access to more     powerful encryption devices?A:   This is a fundamental policy question which will be     considered during the broad policy review.  The key escrow     mechanism will provide Americans with an encryption product     that is more secure, more convenient, and less expensive     than others readily available today, but it is just one     piece of what must be the comprehensive approach to     encryption technology, which the Administration is     developing.     The Administration is not saying, ""since encryption     threatens the public safety and effective law enforcement,     we will prohibit it outright"" (as some countries have     effectively done); nor is the U.S. saying that ""every     American, as a matter of right, is entitled to an     unbreakable commercial encryption product.""  There is a     false ""tension"" created in the assessment that this issue is     an ""either-or"" proposition.  Rather, both concerns can be,     and in fact are, harmoniously balanced through a reasoned,     balanced approach such as is proposed with the ""Clipper     Chip"" and similar encryption techniques.Q:   What does this decision indicate about how the Clinton     Administration's policy toward encryption will differ from     that of the Bush Administration?  A:   It indicates that we understand the importance of encryption     technology in telecommunications and computing and are     committed to working with industry and public-interest     groups to find innovative ways to protect Americans'     privacy, help businesses to compete, and ensure that law     enforcement agencies have the tools they need to fight crime     and terrorism.Q:   Will the devices be exportable?  Will other devices that use     the government hardware?A:   Voice encryption devices are subject to export control     requirements.  Case-by-case review for each export is     required to ensure appropriate use of these devices.  The     same is true for other encryption devices.  One of the     attractions of this technology is the protection it can give     to U.S. companies operating at home and abroad.  With this     in mind, we expect export licenses will be granted on a     case-by-case basis for U.S. companies seeking to use these     devices to secure their own communications abroad.  We plan     to review the possibility of permitting wider exportability     of these products.----------- End included article ----------- -- pat@rwing.uucp      [Without prejudice UCC 1-207]     (Pat Myrto) Seattle, WA         If all else fails, try:       ...!uunet!pilchuck!rwing!patWISDOM: ""Only two things are infinite; the universe and human stupidity,         and I am not sure about the former.""              - Albert Einstien"	sci.crypt

Ithas been used for 1 season on my sailboat. 		All parts are included as well as the installationinstructions. It is even packed in the original box it came in. Thereis no damage to the unit or the transducer. In fact, the transducerwas mounted *inside* the hull in a piece of pipe glued to the hull.So it led a ""sheltered"" life. The transducer can be mounted either insidethe hull as I did, or on the transom. It cannot be placed in a holedrilled into your hull.	It is fully waterproof and fits into a 2"" hole in a bulkhead(that's where I had it installed) or into a standard dashboard on apowerboat. It reads depth to 199' and has a backlit LCD display. It hasan adjustable shallow water alarm built in. 	I am changing out my instruments to another manufacturer thatoutputs the NMEA 0183 information. This little depth sounder works fineand is very stable.	It is usually priced as low as 130$ in some catalogs, I paid 150$.	The first 80$ takes it, or best offer. 				John R.

Also, make sure that yourprogram can not be run out a debugger.Another method of course is to not even make bad sectors on the original disk,just write a certain key to a certain unallocated sector.   To help you here,you also must do the code protection schemes mentioned in the first paragraph.Make sure you also fill the rest of the unallocated parts of the disk withgarbage as well, or they (wanna be crackers) can just look for the junk insome random sector.Like you mentioned, there are the laser holed disks and hardware keys, but theyare both expensive and a pain in the butt for the end-user, which you is theopposite of what you want.Another configuration that can be used is to save the configuration of themachine that it is being installed to in the most undecipherable format you canthink of.  If the program does not find that this is the same system, itrequests being installed by the original disk again.  The original disk shouldbe encrypted, compacted, have many sectors that should be checked, and anythingelse you can think of to make sure that the original cannot be copied.  Onceagain, you MUST put code-encryption, self-rewriting code, and multiple CRCchecks in the program to make sure that it does not get changed.  Among otherthings, this also protects your program from virii.  If the program detects achange in its code, tell the user that a virus has been detected in theprogram.

What I did is to make a metal2, metal, poly, diff sandwich,	but put a lot of holes in the poly layer, allowing frequent	diff-metal1 contacts.  I forget exactly how wide the poly	lines were.  If I were doing this design again, I'd probably	omit the diff altogether, and use a solid poly sheet instead,	using just m2, m1, and poly (and substrate, but that has such a high	resistance it can be ignored at these speeds).4) You are probably better off trying to tune your circuit to run with	slightly slower edges and lower voltage swings (especially for	output signalling), than spending chip area on capacitors.	I had spare space on the die since the circuit was too big for	a MOSIS tiny chip, and the next size up was twice as big as I	needed.

Newsgroup:comp.sys.mac.hardwareDocument_id: 51700From: salmon@cwis.unomaha.edu (David Salmon)Subject: Re: HELP - SCSI Woes on Mac IIfxAccording to the official documentation, failure to use the IIfx terminatorcan not only affect SCSI bus performance but can also damage the bus.Whether this is your problem or not I don't know. I have had sporadic SCSIproblems with my IIfx since I bought it. (I cannot connect more than threedevices, fourth one causes major problems).First thing to do is to try to reformat your drive on someone elses system.If you continue to get errors it is probably the drive. If it formats finethen I would try to format it on your system with no externals. If this fails then the SCSI controller on your IIfx needs repair/replacement.Hope this helps. -- David C.

So there's a kind of nostagia for the old days, before expansion, the Soviet series, Gretzky and even Bobby Orr, when guys weren't afraid to take a hit, nobody floated and defensemen played defence. Who cares that that probably never really existed, the myth is still around in Canada and all the European influence on the game has diminished it in some people's eyes.Personally, I'd like to add before I get flamed, I love the fast-paced ""European"" game and think Don Cherry is a bit of an idiot. I have to say that I missed him when I was living in the States, though.

This is> not true for the Spectral Innovations boards, for example.To boorishly reply to myself, I found I did have the Instrutech informationalready. The specs (to use the term loosely) are as follows:A/D: 16 bit converter, with 14 bit accuracy to 100 kHz, 12 bit accuracy to200 kHz. No specs for S/N, monotonicity, linearity. There are 8 multiplexedinputs sharing the single A/D, so that all inputs are not samples at thesame time, and in the above conversion specs the all-channel sample ratemust be used. Thus, for two channels, you only have 14 unknown quality bitsat 50 kHz per channel. This is poorer quality than the nationalInstruments, at the same sample rate.D/A: 16 bit converter. No specs for S/N, monotonicity, linearity. Each ofthe 4 output channels has its own converter.The price for the external converter box (the ITC-16), the NuBus interfaceboard (the MAC-23), plus C driver software and Igor XOP's is $2695.

My old 83 Accord (now in the hands of a sibling) has a muchbetter engagement of the clutch. Even the old 84 Civic we keep as a beater feels better in this aspect. Note that these are cars with 250,000 kms and140,000 kms respectively. My 90 Prelude blows both of them away in every respect except smooth clutch engagement. Of course the Kawasaki is the bestof the bunch but I need more than 2 wheels most of the time.The Prelude has had a dud clutch from day 1, and after three years and 67,000kms is no better.

You are asking me to provide objective proof for the existence ofGod.  I never claimed to be able to do this; in fact I do not believethat it is possible to do so.  I consider the existence of God tobe a premise or assumption that underlies my philosophy of life.It comes down to a matter of faith.   If I weren't a Christian, Iwould be an agnostic, but I have sufficient subjective evidence tojustify and sustain my relationship with God.  Again this is a matterof premises and assumptions.  I assume that there is more to ""life, theuniverse and everything"" than materialism; ie that spirituality exists.This assumption answers the question about why I have apparent spiritualneeds.  I find this assumption consistent with my subsequent observat-ions.  I then find that God fills these spiritual needs.  But I cannot objectively prove the difference between apparent filling of imagined spiritual needs and real filling of real spiritual needs.  Nor can Iprove to another person that _they_ have spiritual needs.==Seanna Watson   Bell-Northern Research,       | Pray that at the end of living,(seanna@bnr.ca) Ottawa, Ontario, Canada       | Of philosophies and creeds,                                              | God will find his people busyOpinion, what opinions?

It has had many, many problems.  See my earler post that describesthe situation.  I went to BBB arbitration, and they ruled that Chevroletmust buy it back from me.  If you do get one, stay away from the 5 speedmanual with the deep low first gear.  They have put three of them in mytruck so far.  After about 1,500 miles, overdrive either startsrattling or hissing loudly.  There is no way to fix them.  Chevrolet says that the noise is ""a characteristic of the transmission.""Also, if you are planning to use your truck to tow, thegear ratios in that tranny suck.  On a steep hill, you get up to about55 MPH in second gear at 4,000 RPM (yellow line).  If you shift to third,the RPM drop to only 2,500, and you begin to loose speed.  I shouldpoint out that the 350 V8 they put in the HD (8600 GVW) trucks is adetuned motor compared to the one they put in the light duty ones.  Theydropped the compression ratio, supposedly for ""engine longevity""reasons.  So the light duty 350 may pull better than my truck does.Other things that have gone wrong include the ventilation fan (3 times so far), paint (had specs of rust embedded in the paint from beingshipped by rail with no covering), and suspension parts (link betweenstabilizer and control arm fell off).Any company can make a bad individual car, Chevrolet included.  Whatreally bothered me was the way they reacted.  They made no attemptto deal with me except to tell me to take it back to the dealer for them to attempt to fix it one more time.  So I bought a brand newFord F250 HD Super Cab with a 460 and an automatic.  I will neverbuy another Chevrolet.jackw@hpdmd48.boi.hp.com"	rec.autos
