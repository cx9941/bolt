These folks are now >in their 60's-70's.  Makes me wonder how many of them occupy positionsThat is the result of watching anti-Muslim 'SDPA' Nazis/crooks/idiots too much. Still covering up the crimes of your fascist Armenian grandparents and Nazi Armenian parents? Not a chance. As early as 1934, K. S. Papazian asserted in 'Patriotism Perverted' that the Armenians        'lean toward Fascism and Hitlerism.'[1]At that time, he could not have foreseen that the Armenians wouldactively assume a pro-German stance and even collaborate in WorldWar II. His book was dealing with the Armenian genocide of the Muslimpopulation of Eastern Anatolia. However, extreme rightwing ideologicaltendencies could be observed within the Dashnagtzoutune long beforethe outbreak of the Second World War.In 1936, for example, O. Zarmooni of the 'Tzeghagrons' was quotedin the 'Hairenik Weekly:' ""The race is force: it is treasure. If we follow history we shall  see that races, due to their innate force, have created the nations and these have been secure only insofar as they have reverted to the race after becoming a nation. Today Germany and Italy are strong because as nations they live and breath in terms of race. On the other hand, Russia is comparatively weak because she is bereft of social sanctities.""[2][1] K. S. Papazian, 'Patriotism Perverted,' (Boston, Baikar Press   1934), Preface.[2] 'Hairenik Weekly,' Friday, April 10, 1936, 'The Race is our   Refuge' by O. Zarmooni.In April 1942, Hitler was preparing for the invasion of the Caucasus.A number of Nazi Armenian leaders began submitting plans to Germanofficials in spring and summer 1942. One of them was Souren BegzadianPaikhar, son of a former ambassador of the Armenian Republic in Baku.Paikhar wrote a letter to Hitler, asking for German support to hisArmenian national socialist movement Hossank and suggesting thecreation of an Armenian SS formation in order ""to educate the youth of liberated Armenia according to the  spirit of the Nazi ideas.""He wanted to unite the Armenians of the already occupied territoriesof the USSR in his movement and with them conquer historic Turkishhomeland. Paikhar was confined to serving the Nazis in GoebbelsPropaganda ministry as a speaker for Armenian- and French-languageradio broadcastings.[1] The Armenian-language broadcastings wereproduced by yet another Nazi Armenian Viguen Chanth.[2][1] Patrick von zur Muhlen (Muehlen), p. 106.[2] Enno Meyer, A. J. Berkian, 'Zwischen Rhein und Arax, 900    Jahre Deutsch-Armenische beziehungen,' (Heinz Holzberg    Verlag-Oldenburg 1988), pp. 124 and 129.The establishment of Armenian units in the German army was favoredby General Dro (the Butcher). He played an important role in theestablishment of the Armenian 'legions' without assuming any official position. His views were represented by his men in therespective organs. An interesting meeting took place between Droand Reichsfuehrer-SS Heinrich Himmler toward the end of 1942.Dro discussed matters of collaboration with Himmler and aftera long conversation, asked if he could visit POW camp close toBerlin. Himmler provided Dro with his private car.[1] A minor problem was that some of the Soviet nationals were not'Aryans' but 'subhumans' according to the official Nazi philosophy.As such, they were subject to German racism. However, Armenianswere the least threatened and indeed most privileged. In August 1933, Armenians had been recognized as Aryans by the Bureau ofRacial Investigation in the Ministry for Domestic Affairs.[1] Meyer, Berkian, ibid., pp. 112-113.Need I go on?Serdar Argic                           'We closed the roads and mountain passes that                             might serve as ways of escape for the Turks                             and then proceeded in the work of extermination.'

"From: jer@prefect.cc.bellcore.com (rathmann,janice e)Subject: Re: Sinus vs. Migraine (was Re: Sinus Endoscopy)I noticed several years ago that when I took analgesics fairly regularly,(motrin at the time), I seemed to get a lot of migraines.  But hadforgotten about that until I started reading some of the posts here.I generally don't take NSAIDS or Tylenol for headaches, because I'vefound them to be ineffective.  However, I have two other pain sourcesthat force me to take NSAIDS (currently Naprosyn).  First, is somepelvic pain that I get at the beginning of my period, and then muchworse at midcycle.  I have had surgery for endometriosis in the past(~12 years ago), so the Drs. tell me that my pain is probably dueto the endometriosis coming back.  I've tried Synarel, it reducedthe pain while I took it (3 mos), but the pain returned immediatelyafter I stopped.  Three doctors have suggested hysterectomy as theonly ""real solution"" to my problem.  Although I don't expect to haveany more children, I don't like the idea of having my uterus andone remaining ovary removed (the first ovary was removed when I hadthe surgery for endometriosis).  One of the Drs that suggestedI get a hysterectomy is an expert in laser surgery, but perhaps thinksthat type of procedure is only worthwhile on women who still planto have children.  So basically all I'm left with is toughing outthe pain.  This would be impossible without Naprosyn (or somethingsimilar - but not aspirin, that doesn't work, and Motrin gave mehorrible gastritis a few years ago, so I'm through with it).  Infact, Naprosyn works very well at eliminating the pain if I takeit regularly as I did when I had severe back pain (and pain in both legs) as I'll discuss in a moment.  Generally though, I wait untilI have the pain before I take the Naprosyn, but then it takesseveral hours for it reduce the pain (it's actually quite effectiveat reducing the pain, it just takes quite a while).  In the meantimeI'm frequently in severe pain.The other pain source I have is chronic lower back pain resulting inbilateral radiculopathy.  I've had MRIs, Xrays, CT scan, and EMGs(I've had 2 of them, and don't intend to ever do that again) withnerve conduction tests.  The tests have not been conclusive as towhat is causing my back and leg pain.  The MRI reports both say I haveseveral bulging, degeneratig disks, and from the Xrays (and MRI, I think)it is apparent that I have arthritis.  The reading on the CT scanwas that there are two herniations (L3-L4, and L4-L5), but othershav looked at the films and concluded that there are no herniations.The second EMG and nerve conduction studies shows significant denervationcompared to the first EMG.  Oh yeah, I had some other horrible test,called something like Somatic Evoked Response which showed that the""internal nerves"" are working fine.   Anyway, the bottom line is thatI sometimes have severe pain in both legs and back pain.  The back painis there all the time, but I can live with it.  When the leg pain is there,I need some analgesic/anti-inflammatory medication to reduce the painto a level where I can work.  So I took Naprosyn regulary for 6-9months (every time I tried to stop the leg pain got worse, so I'd always resume).  Since last November I have taken it much less frequently,and primarily for the pelvic pain.  I have been going to physicaltherapy for the last 8 months (2-3 times a week).  After the first monthor so, my therapist put me on pelvic traction (she had tried it earlier,but it had caused a lot of pain in my back, this time she tried it ata lower weight).  After a month or two, the pain in my legs began goingaway (but the traction aways caused discomfort in my lower back, whichcould be reduced with ultrasound and massage).  So now, I don't havenearly as much pain in my legs, in fact my therapist took me offtraction about 2 weeks ago.Getting back to my original reason for this post...  Even if I can avoidtaking analgesic for headaches, I really can't avoid them entirely becauseI have other pain sources, that ""force"" me to use them (Oh, I forgotto mention that it has been suggested to me that I have back surgery,but I'm avoiding that too).  I find the migraines difficult to deal with,occassionally I have to take off work, but usually I can work, but ata reduced capacity (I'm a systems engineer and do a lot of readingand writing).  When the pelvic pain is bad, I can't concentrate much,I usually end up jumping out of my chair every few minutes, becausethe pain is so bothersome.  When the pain in my back is bad, it cancause severe burning in both legs, shooting pains in my legs, electricshock type of pain in my feet and toes, and basically when it gets badI can't really sit at all.  Then I end up spending most of my time homeand in bed.  So even if the analgesics contribute to the migraines, themigraines are more tolerable than the other pain sources.  I get a lotof migraines, an average of 3 to 4 a month, which last 1-3 days.I've taken cafergot (the first time the caffiene really got to me soI reduced the dosage), but I don't like the side effects (if I takemore than two I get diahrea).  If I get a very bad headache, I willeventually take the cafergot.  My neurologist wasn't very helpful whenI told him my problems with cafergot, he said that when sumatriptanbecomes available, I should try that.  I've tried several other medications(fiornal, midrin, fiornal with codeine, tegretol, and inderal) butthey either didn't work, or I couldn't tolerate them.  So what can I do?My doctor's seem to be satisfied with me just trying to tolerate thepain, which I agree with most of the time, but not when I have a lot ofpain.  I've had some bad experiences with surgery (my heart stoppedonce from the anesthesia - I was told that it was likely thesuccinylcholine), and I've already had surgery several times.Anyway, the point of what I'm saying is that even if analgesics can contributeto migraines, some people NEED to take them to tolerate other pain.Janice Rathmann"	sci.med

Obviously, if a ""truth"" is not always ""true"" then we have a>> contradiction in terms.  I agree with Carol here.  Determining absolutes is, practically speaking, awaste of time.  And we easily forget that relative truth is, in fact relative.For example, I recently was asking some children the question ""What temperaturedoes water boil at?""  I got the answer 212 degrees consistently.  I askedif they knew what scale, and was told ""It's just 212 degrees.  Any scale.That's what all thermometers say.""  Well, that's sincere, and may betrue in the experience of the speaker, but it is simply wrong.  IT is NOTan absolute truth.  Similarly, Scripture is full of Truth, which we shouldnurture and cherish, but trying to determine which parts are Absolute Truthand which parts are the manifestations of that in the context of the timeand culture in which the text was penned is missing the point.  Then religioneasily becomes an intellectual head-trip, devoid of the living experience of the indwelling Trinity and becomes dead scholasticism, IMO. [example of head-covering in Church deleted]This was a good example.  There may be an Absolute Truth behind thewriting, but the simplest understanding of the passage is that theinstructions apply to the Corinthians, and not necessarily elsewhere.The instructions may reflect Absolute Truth in the context of firstcentury culture and the particular climate at Corinth, which was havinga LOT of trouble with order. Is it Absolute Truth to me?  No.  And I see no compelling, or even reasonable, reason that it should be. >Evangelicals are clearly not taking this particular part of scripture >to be absolute truth.  (And there are plenty of other examples.)>Can you reconcile this?Even the most die-hard literalists do not take all of the Bible literally.I've yet to meet anyone who takes the verse ""blessed is he who takes yourbabies and smashes their heads against the rocks"" literally.  The Biblewas not printed or handed to us by God with color codings to tell uswhat parts should be interpreted which way.  >> Many people claim that there are no absolutes in the world.

And even if we knew them, personally, we may not be able to express that in a way that still conveys Absolute Truth to another.The presence of absence of Absolutes may not make any difference, since Iknow I can never fully apprehend an Absolute if it walks up and greets me.>>> >There is hardly consensus, even in evangelical >> >Christianity (not to mention the rest of Christianity) regarding >> >Biblical interpretation.>> >> So?  People sometimes disagree about what is true. This does not negate >> the fact, however, that there are still absolutes in the universe.  I can't prove the existence of absolutes.  I can only rely upon MY experience.I also trust God's revelation that WE cannot fully comprehend the infinite.Therefore we can't comprehend the Absolutes.  So I don't need them.  I can never know the essence of God, only the energies by and through whichGod is manifested to God's creation.  So the reality can be that there AREabsolutes, but it is of no practical importance.  It's like claiming that theoriginal scriptural autographs were perfect, but copies may not be.  Swell.Who cares?  It doesn't affect me in any practical useful way.  I might as well believe that God has made a lot of electric blue chickens, and that theylive on Mars.  Maybe God did.  So what? Is that going to have ANY effect on how I deal with my neighbor, or God?  Whether or not I go to this or thatcafeteria for lunch?  No.  This attitude leads many non-Christians to believe that ALL Christiansare arrogant idiots incapable of critical reasoning.  Christianity is true,wonderful and sensible.  It appeals to Reason, since Reason is an innerreflection of the Logos of God.  Explanations that violate that simplyappear to be insecure authoritarian responses to a complex world.NOTE:  I'm NOT claiming there is no place for authority. That'd be silly.       There IS a world of difference between authoritative and authoritarian.       Authoritative is en expression of authority that respects others.       Authoritarian is en expression of authority that fails to do that,       and is generally agressive.  Good parents (like God) are authoritative.       Many Christians are simply authoritarian, and, not surprisingly, few        adults respond to this treatment.Larry Overacker (llo@shell.com)-- -------Lawrence OverackerShell Oil Company, Information Center    Houston, TX            (713) 245-2965llo@shell.com"	soc.religion.christian

True, MSproducts do not boast features that MS invented, but how many productsout there by other vendors out there are truely innovative intheir continuing development? I think what makes MS special to the public is thier innovative pricing.It is true the XWindows/MAC/NEXT all have some feature(s) in thier GUIthat are better than MS.  But people like me can't afford them.It is true that Apple has lower their pricing on the low end models..but they are just that...low end.  System 7 is a better operatingsystem, but the machines they operate on just are too expensive formy tastes...A UNIX platform is powerful enuf, but tell the commonuser to set up .Xdefault (i am still confused on what some of them things do) and they either puke or faint.  If u think about it, low prices aint innovative if u come down to it.  Butfor the product it offers and on the lower cost (and powerful hardwarethat it runs on as compare to macs)....MS is kinda innovative..Oh yea, I guess the fact that the support products and applicationsthey have garnered for MSWindows does make them kinda innovative too..>   Dixon D.

It is    disingeneous to compare their death to that of athletes in Munich   or any other act of terrorism or mrder.  This exercise is aimed    solely at diverting the issue and is far from the truth.I agree that the death of three soldiers on a patrol etc... isnot terrorism.  That having been said, lets continue.   [snip]   imagine ????  It is NOT a ""terrorist camp"" as you and the Israelis like    to view the villages they are small communities with kids playing soccer   in the streets, women preparing lunch, men playing cards, etc.....I would not argue that all or even most of the villages are ""terroristcamps"".  There are however some which come very close to serving thatpurpose and that is not to say that other did not function in that wayprior to the invasion.    SOME young men, usually aged between 17 to 30 years are members of   the Lebanese resistance.  Even the inhabitants of the village do not    know who these are, they are secretive about it, but most people often   suspect who they are and what they are up to.  These young men are   supported financially by Iran most of the time.  They sneak arms and   ammunitions into the occupied zone where they set up booby traps   for Israeli patrols.  Every time an Israeli soldier is killed or injured   by these traps, Israel retalliates by indiscriminately bombing villages   of their own choosing often killing only innocent civilians.  Once they   are back they announce that they bombed a ""terrorist  hideout"" where   an 8 year old girl just happened to be.Some of the villages, and yours might well be among them, are as youdescribe.  Not all are.  There are a large number of groups in the area,backed by various organizations, with a wide range of purposes.  Hizbollahand Amal were two of the larger ones and may still be.  As to retaliation,while mistakes may be made, that is still a far cry from indiscriminatebombing, which would have produced major casualties.   Israel's retalliation policy is cold hearted, but a reality that   we have come to accept and deal with, the Lebanese Resistance   on the other hand is not going to stop its attacks on OCCUPYING    ISRAELI SOLDIERS until they withdraw, this is the only real    leverage that they have to force Israel to withdraw.Well, here we disagree.  I think that Israel would willingly withdraw ifthe Lebanese gov't was able to field a reliable force in the area to policeit and prevent further attacks.   This is the only realistic solution, it is time for Israel to   realize that the concept of a ""buffer zone"" aimed at protecting   its northern cities has failed.  In fact it has caused much more   Israeli deaths than the occasional shelling of Northern Israel   would have resulted in.  Actually that is not clear at all.  I will agree that the death toll is nolonger civilian and now primarily military though.   There seems to be very little incentive for the Syrian and Lebanese   goovernment to allow Hizbollah to bomb Israel proper under such    circumstances, and now the Lebanese government has proven that it is   capable of controlling and disarming all militias as they did   in all other parts of Lebanon.No, the Syrian gov't is more than happy to have Israel sink into anotherLebanese morass.  I could elaborate if necessary.   I agree, only in the case of the Isareli soldiers their killing   CANNOT be qualified as murder, no matter what you say.No, but it is regretable, as is the whole situation.--Shai Guday              | Stealth bombers,OS Software Engineer    |Thinking Machines Corp. |	the winged ninjas of the skies.Cambridge, MA           |"	talk.politics.mideast

Later heappeared to the 11 disciples at mealtime.Luke says two followers went, the same day that Jesus rose from the dead, toEmmaus, a village eight miles from Jeruselem, and there Jesus jioned them butwas unrecognised.  While they ate a meal together that evening, they finallyrecognised Jesus, whereopon he dissapeared.  Returning at once to Jeruselem,they told thedisciples of their experience, and suddenly Jesus appeared among them,frightening them, as they thought he was a spirit.  Jesus then ate some fishand honey and then preached to them.John says Jesus appeared to the disciples the evening of the day he arrose, inJeruselem, where they were hiding.  He breathed the Holy Ghost opon them, butThomas was not present and refused to believe. Eight days later Jesus joinedthe disciples again at the same place and this time he convinced Thomas.	Oncemore Jesus made anappearance to the disciples at the sea of Tiberias but again was notrecognised. After telling them to cast their netson the other side of the boat, Jesusbecomes known to them and prepares bread and fish for them.  They all eattogether and converse.The book of acts further adds to the confusion.  It says that Jesus showedhimself to the apostles for a period of 40 days after his resurection (thuscontradicting Matthew, Mark, Luke AND John) and spoke to them of thingspertaining to the kingdom of God: ""And when he had spoken these things, whilethey beheld, he was taken up; and a cloud recieved him out of their sight. And while they looked steadfastly toward heaven as he went up, two men stoodby them in white apparel: Which also said, Ye men of Galilee, why stand yegazing into heaven? This same Jesus, which is taken from you into heaven,shall so comein like manneras ye have seen him go into heaven"" Acts 1:3-11Paul outdoes every other ""authority"" by saying that Jesus was seen by 500persons between the time of the resurection and theassension, although he does not say where.	He also claims that he himself ""asone born out of due time"" also saw Jesus. 1 Cor 15:6-8.>The AscensionMatthew says nothing about it.	Mark casually says that Jesus was recieved intoheaven after he was finished talking with thedisciples in Jeruselem.  Luke says Jesus led the desciples to Bethany and thatwhile he blessed them, he was parted from them and carried up into heaven. John says nothing about it.  Actscontradicts all of the above.  (See previous section)>When second coming?MAT 24:34  Verily I say unto you, This generation shall not pass, till allthese things be fulfilled.MAR 13:30  Verily I say unto you, that this generation shall  not pass, tillall these things be done.LUK 21:32  Verily I say unto you, This generation shall not  pass away, tillall be fulfilled.1 thessalonians 4:15-18>How many apostles were in office between the resurection and ascention 1 Corinthians 15:5 (12)Matthew 27:3-5 (minus one from 12)Acts 1:9-26 (Mathias not elected until after resurrection)MAT 28:16  Then the eleven disciples went away into Galilee, into a mountainwhere Jesus had appointed them.> ascend to heaven	""And Elijah went up by a whirlwind into heaven."" (2 Kings 2:11)	""No man hath ascended up to heaven but he that came down from heaven, 	...the Son of Man."" (John 3:13)As you can see, there are a number of contradictions in the account of thetrial, crucifiction and resurection of Jesus.  If these are good witnesses,you would think that they could get SOME of these important details right! (In fact, I cannot find very many points on where they AGREE.  You would thinkthat they could at least agree on some of the points they were supposedlyobserving!) Because of the fact that there is so much contradiction and error,the story of the resurection as presented cannot be taken as literal truth.(Due to the nature of the story, I doubt if it should be taken as ANY sort oftruth.)

"From: kimgh@mentor.cc.purdue.edu (Gene Kim)Subject: REVIEW: 1989 Ford Taurus SHOReview of 1989 Ford Taurus SHO -- By Gene Kim=============================================Background:    Last week, I bought a 1989 Ford Taurus SHO, moving up from drivinga 1987 Toyota Celica ST and a 1975 Oldsmobile Cutlass.  I have beeninterested in buying a SHO for about five months and have been combingthe classifieds in Denver and Chicago every week.  I bought aremarkably clean maroon/red SHO with 92K miles on it for $6800.As far as I can tell, this is about $2000 under Blue Book and I stillhave another 8000 miles before the Extended Service Plan runs out.    As one should with any pre-1991 SHOs, I made sure that the car wasalready refit with the upgraded clutch and pressure plate, as well ashaving been recalled for upgraded rotors and seatbelt attachments.However, my SHO does not have the newer rod shifter -- I understand Ican get this for $230 from any Ford service center.  In addition, thecar received the full tune-up at 60K miles, receiving new platinumplugs and valve adjustment.    For a car with 92K miles on it, the car was virtually immaculate.The clearcoat paint job was devoid of any large chips or dents,although the front air-dam/molding was covered with lots of smallscratches -- not surprising since most of the miles were spent on thehighway.    Having driven a smaller two-door coupe for so long, I was a bitconcerned about whether I could get used to driving a larger car.  Tomy surprise, the size of the car doesn't bother me at all -- it seemsjust as nimble as my Celica!  (No comparisons with my Oldsmobile.  :-)Visibility from the driver's seat is excellent, helped mostly by ofthe small the quarter-windows, aft of the back-seat door windows andin front of the C-pillar and rear window.  Parallel parking is a bitmore difficult, but other than that, I love the size.    In fact, I'm starting to appreciate the large trunk as I pack upfor a 14-hour drive to Washington, DC for the summer.  More on theride later in this review.Engine:        As with anyone even slightly interested in SHOs, I was veryinterested in the 24-valve 3.0L Yamaha ""Shogun"" engine.  I was notdisappointed.  Base performance of the engine under 4000 rpms isgood.  You can even do reasonable launches from second gear, althoughI don't make a practice of this.  The engine revs smoothly and eagerly-- tooling around town does not require many shifts.  This is goodsince the shifter is definitely one of the weakest points of the car.(More on this later.)    While the performance of the engine under 4000 rpms may beunremarkable, it undergoes a Jekyll/Hyde transformation once you hithigher revs.  At 4500 rpms, a butterfly valve opens and you canliterally hear and feel the geometry of the engine changing as twelvemore valves open up.  The engine soars to its 7000 rpm redline, andyou are treated to, in my opinion, the sweetest sounding V6 around.The engine inexplicably sounds OVERJOYED to be at 6500 rpm!    I've noticed that when I drive around town, I constantly watch thetach to see how far below 4000 rpm I am.  To go from 2000 rpm to 4000,you may have to punch the accelerator -- while torque is more thanadequate, it doesn't come fully online until those other 12 valvesare used.Transmission:    When _Car and Driver_ first reviewed the car in 1988, theymarvelled at how Ford had put such a wimpy clutch and balky shifterinto the car.  I remember driving a friend's parent's SHO in 1990, andremember thinking about whether I had the leg strength to drive thecar in traffic -- the clutch was that stiff.  That was back then.    The entire clutch assembly on my SHO has been replaced under aFord recall in 1991.  The clutch on the SHO feels no stiffer than theone on my Toyota Celica.  In fact, the friction point seems a bitlarger and more forgiving.    When playing with the shifter with the car parked, the shifterfelt very reasonable.  The 1-2 and 3-4 gates were where you'd expectit to be, and the shifting action was smooth.  On the road, it'smuch the same -- but you have to shift SLOWLY!  Make no mistake, it'sa clumsy shifter.    When hurrying shifts, like when I was initially trying to impressfriends, I consistently miss the 1-2 shift, often grope clumsily forthe 2-3 shift, and sometimes even muff the 3-4 shift.  I find thispretty amazing in a car like this.    It also took me several days to realize that you get the smoothestshifts when you take your time.  Seems obvious, but compared to myToyota and my friend's Honda, this seems atrocious and clumsy.Someone on rec.autos noted that CRXs should blow SHOs off-the-linebecause of the incredibly clumsy shifter.    I now shift much more sedately, and the shifter seems morereasonable.  When you play within these bounds, the shifter workssmoothly with no surprises.  I don't know whether the rod shifterupgrade would help at all.    Along these same lines, I initially had trouble shifting gearssmoothly.  Again, slowing down the shifts and taking more care tomatch revs when letting out the clutch helped immensely.  This tookseveral days for me to get the hang of.  (I think some of my problemswere because I've never had a car with enough power to balk at badshifts in higher gears.)    Occasionally, I have trouble shifting into reverse.  The shifterrefuses to enter the gate, and I often grind the synchros trying to get it into gear.  I'll be watching this carefully in the next coupleof months.    A quirk:  When I upshift and the engine drops back to 1000-2500rpm, I hear a whirring and then a grinding noise coming from the theengine compartment.  Not terribly loud, but the passenger candefinitely hear it.  I asked about it when I was looking at the car,as do all my passengers.  Apparently, this is a definitely a ""SHOsound"" and is the gearbox -- apparently called ""gear rollover"".Replies to my queries on rec.autos are at the end of this review.Exterior:    As I mentioned before, I am astounded by how well the body of thisSHO has stood up.  Paint chipping on the front bumper and grille arevirtually non-existent.  Looking at how older Tauri sometimesdon't age so gracefully, I wonder what the guys at Ford diddifferently to the SHO bodies.    The body, in my opinion, is extremely attractive with matchingcolor body moldings than the stock Tauri.  For some odd reason, theSHO seems different enough from vanilla Tauri to get stares atstoplights -- of course, this could be my overactive imagination.:-)  SHOs get fog lights, a more open grille, a completelymonochromatic exterior, and a deeper ground skirt in the back with""SHO"" stenciled in relief.  I've seen a couple SHOs whose owners havecolored these in with florescent colors or in black.  Yuck.    I don't think the car is flashy.  I like it that way.  I feelalmost anonymous with all those Tauri out there, but different anddistinctive enough to those of us who care.  :-)Interior:    The interior is what really makes me feel like I don't deserve thecar.  The seats are grey leather, the steering wheel and shifter arecovered with black leather, and the entire instrument panel is done ina black/grey/metallic scheme.      The instrumentation is stock Taurus, except for the 140 mph speedoand 8000 rpm tach.  You get a center console with two cupholders, alarge compartment under the radio (great for a CD player), an armrestthat contains yet another compartment, three appropriately sized coinholders for tollways (I think), and a compartment for holdingcassette tapes.  There's map-holders in the doors, and an oddly smallglove compartment.    I spilled a whole can of Coke in the cupholder and was delightedto find that the entire rubber holder can be removed and washed in asink.  Hey, I'm really impressed with the ergonomics andthoughtfulness that went into its design.  And it's a 1989, before theinterior was upgraded!    The backseat is bigger than any car I've had.  Why do they need somuch space?  :-)  (No smart-ass comments, please.  :-)    The driver and passenger seat have lumbar and side bolsters.  Fromwhat I hear, it's not uncommon for the side bolsters to show wear.Mine is no exception.  The left side bolster on the driver's hascracked and I'm not convinced the right bolster is inflating all theway.    A big surprise for me:  I forgot that SHOs don't have a normalhand parking brake.  Instead, they have the regular parking brake thatyou press with your left foot.  Too bad.  Again, I'm getting used toit, but it seems a bit anachronistic to me.Ride:    The suspension is nice and stiff.  Too stiff?  It's stiffer thanany car I've had.  A friend's new 1993 Toyota Celica ST seems tauterand is still able to soak up bumps better.  The SHO seems stiffer withless ability to soak up bumps.  Driving over railroad tracks is anoisy and jarring affair.  On the other hand, taking turns feelswonderful because the body is so rigid and doesn't flex at all -- Ilistened for that before I bought the car.    On the highway, the ride is great.  When I drove the car fromChicago back to Purdue, I had trouble keeping under 85 mph, let alonefrom trying to see what 100 mph really feels like.  It's a relativelyquiet ride, but the sunroof rattles.  I've tried to find out whatexactly makes all the noise up there, but it seems to be the windowthat rests on the rails.  No easy way to get rid of it, I think.    Over the past three days, I've oscillated between thinking thesuspension is wonderful and perfect and thinking that the ride is waytoo rough.  (Not for me, mind you.  But I wonder whether I wouldadvise my dad to buy one for himself.)  But, I've discovered, as withthe shifter, if you take your time with shifts, you'll have no reasonto complain.  Let me explain...    The ride is worst when turning and applying lots of power to thewheels.  I feel the wheels scrabbling for traction and torque steermaking the car skitter left and right.  After I understood this, Iavoid the limits of traction -- and I'm a happy camper again.    It's not body rigidity, but the composure of the car.    As if matching the suspension, the steering feel is quite heavy.My first impression of driving my SHO was how hard you had to turn thewheel at highway speeds.  It tracks straight as an arrow, but whendriving around a parking lot, the high-effort steering didn't seem souseful.  However, it's reasonable, but it doesn't communicate the roadto the driver as well as a 1993 Ford Probe GT.  IMHO, it's much betterthan the steering on my Celica ST.    I wonder how bad this car is during winter?Miscellaneous notes:    GRIPES:    The rattles from the sunroof is intermittent -- some days it rattles        loudly, other days I look up wondering where all the noise went.    Activating the sunroof is sometimes very noisy -- loud squealing as	it retracts on its rails.  I wonder if there is a quick fix for this.	Again, other days it completely disappears.  (Function of humidity?)    Once I made the connection between the sometimes awful feeling suspension	and torque steer, I've never complained about ride.    I wish the seats had more support under the thighs.  Also, I wish the	side bolsters would close more tightly.      I hear that tires for this car can get really expensive.  I	currently have Goodyear GT+4s that cost the previous owner $500	for four.    I used to hate the Ford stereo systems -- whose idea was it	to use a volume *paddle*?  Now, to my amazement, I don't	really mind...  and sometimes think it's an okay idea!!!	Pretty ridiculous, though.    Getting up to 4000 rpm sometimes seems to be a chore.  But,	this is no big deal.  There is more than enough torque	down low.    I often goof up the shifting when driving with friends.  It	took me a couple of days before I could really shift	smoothly from 2nd to 3rd gear.  (Hard to believe, isn't it?)    My car has almost 93,000 miles on it.  My parents noted that	it is almost impossible to find a low-mileage SHO. 	Astute observation, IMHO.  I wonder how long I can make	my SHO last -- I just bought a book titled ""Drive It Forever""	for tips in this department.  :-)    The goofy parking brake pedal still throws me for a loop.  I once	parked the car in gear, and then accidentally let out the clutch	after I started it.  The car jolted forward, and bounced off	the car in front of me -- no paint damage at all, but starting the car 	is a whole new ritual for me with that fangled pedal!  Also, I began 	to wonder how strong that brake really is.  (Today, I backed out of 	parking spot today and started to drive away before I noticed 	the glowing brake light.  Oops.)    The driver's power window creaks when closed all the way.  The same    	thing happens in my parents 1989 Mercury Sable.  Oddly, all the	other windows work smoothly.    LIKES:    I'm liking the interior amenities more and more each day.  The    	cupholders are great.    I didn't expect to use the keyless entry buttons so much, but	it really is handy.  You can lock all the doors by	pressing the 7/8 and 9/10 buttons together!  Neat!  And	you can never lock yourself out of the car.    I really feel like I don't deserve this car.  I really can't	believe that I could afford it.  I got this car ten years 	ahead of schedule.  :-)    I love this car so much that I've been telling my parents to	look into buying one.  I love this car so much that I	wrote this 13K file -- I meant to write a couple of lines	and ended up with this.      If there were a J.D. Powers Survey for used car owners, I would have	an opportunity to express my incredible satisfaction of owning this 	car.  I don't like thinking about getting another car, but at this	point in time, I'm sure I'd buy another SHO.  For under $7000, you	can't beat it.  (Next time with an airbag and ABS, though.)    Insurance-wise, this car is also a big win.  I pay the same premiums	as on my 1987 Toyota Celica -- despite that it has nearly twice	the horsepower.  Other Odds and Ends:    Much to my amazement, there is no SHO mailing list anywhere.Maybe because the _SHO Registry_ publication has filled this void.  Ihaven't joined yet, but I've noticed that queries about SHOs stillappear on rec.autos about once a month.  Owners of SHOs are alwaysquick to respond, and are very vocal fans of the cars.  (Maybe someof the most vocal on rec.autos.  :-)    I've put together the responses to my questions about the cars, aswell as other posts with useful information on these cars.  I'll be posting this in the form of a FAQ soon.

But the demonstration of thisproduct really impressive, if it didn't cheat.The setup of the demo is fairly simple. A cone shaped rotor ishalf submerged in a small oil sink, filled with motor oil. The rotoris powered by an electronic motor. A metal pad is pressed againstthe rotor using the torque wrench until the rotor stopped by friction. The torque that is needed to stop rotor is read from the torque wrench.Before MILITECH was added, the rotor was stopped with about 60 lb-ftof torque (You pick the brand of oil, no difference). Once MILITECH was added to the oil, the rotor could not be stopped even with 120+ lb-ft oftorque. Here is the good part: even after the salesman emptied the oil sink, you still could not stopped the rotor with the thin film remained  on it.They say you need only add 2oz per quart of oil every 15k miles. A 16 ozbottle is $25.I still have my doubts. If this product is really so great, why it wasso little known? The salesman said it is widely used in military. I didn'tbelieve it.  The demo was so impressive, that I bought a bottle againstmy common sense.Has anyone heard of or actually used this product?

EDT	     	     	     THE PRESIDENT:  On February the 28th, four federal agents were killed in the line of duty trying to enforce the law against the Branch Davidian compound, which had illegally stockpiled weaponry and ammunition, and placed innocent children at risk.  Because the BATF operation had failed to meet its objective, a 51-day standoff ensued.  	     	     The Federal Bureau of Investigation then made every reasonable effort to bring this perilous situation to an end without bloodshed and further loss of life.  The Bureau's efforts were ultimately unavailing because the individual with whom they were dealing, David Koresh, was dangerous, irrational, and probably insane.      	     He engaged in numerous activities which violated both federal law and common standards of decency.  He was, moreover, responsible for the deaths and injuries which occurred during the action against the compound in February.  Given his inclination towards violence and in an effort to protect his young hostages, no provocative actions were taken for more than seven weeks by federal agents against the compound.  	     	     This weekend I was briefed by Attorney General Reno on an operation prepared by the FBI, designed to increase pressure on Koresh and persuade those in the compound to surrender peacefully.  The plan included a decision to withhold the use of ammunition, even in the face of fire, and instead to use tear gas that would not cause permanent harm to health, but would, it was hoped, force the people in the compound to come outside and to surrender.	     	     I was informed of the plan to end the siege.  I discussed it with Attorney General Reno.  I asked the questions I thought it was appropriate for me to ask.  I then told her to do what she thought was right, and I take full responsibility for the implementation of the decision.  	     	     Yesterday's action ended in a horrible human tragedy.  Mr. Koresh's response to the demands for his surrender by federal agents was to destroy himself and murder the children who were his captives, as well as all the other people who were there who did not survive.  He killed those he controlled, and he bears ultimate responsibility for the carnage that ensued.	     	     Now we must review the past with an eye towards the future.  I have directed the United Stated Departments of Justice and Treasury to undertake a vigorous and thorough investigation to uncover what happened and why, and whether anything could have been done differently.  I have told the departments to involve independent professional law enforcement officials in the investigation.  I expect to receive analysis and answers in whatever time is required to complete the review.  Finally, I have directed the departments to cooperate fully with all congressional inquiries so that we can continue to be fully accountable to the American people.	     	     I want to express my appreciation to the Attorney General, to the Justice Department, and to the federal agents on the front lines who did the best job they could under deeply difficult circumstances.  	     	     Again, I want to say as I did yesterday, I am very sorry for the loss of life which occurred at the beginning and at the end of this tragedy in Waco.  I hope very much that others who will be tempted to join cults and to become involved with people like David Koresh will be deterred by the horrible scenes they have seen over the last seven weeks.  And I hope very much that the difficult situations which federal agents confronted there and which they will be doubtless required to confront in other contexts in the future will be somewhat better handled and better understood because of what has been learned now.	     	     Q	  Mr. President, can you, first of all, tell us why, after 51 days, you decided --	     	     Q	  Mr. President, can you describe for us what it is that Janet Reno outlined to you in your 15-minute phone conversation with --	     	     THE PRESIDENT:  I can't hear you both.  If one will go first and then the other.	     	     Q	  Sorry.  Can you describe what Janet Reno --	     	     Q	  Mr. President --	     	     THE PRESIDENT:  I'll answer both your questions, but I can't do it at once.	     	     Q	  Can you describe what she told you on Sunday about the nature of the operation and how much detail you knew about it?	     	     THE PRESIDENT:  Yes.  I was told by the Attorney General that the FBI strongly felt that the time had come to take another step in trying to dislodge the people in the compound.  And she described generally what the operation would be -- that they wanted to go in and use tear gas which had been tested not to cause permanent damage to adults or to children, but which would make it very difficult for people to stay inside the building.  And it was hoped that the tear gas would permit them to come outside.  	     	     I was further told that under no circumstances would our people fire any shots at them even if fired upon.  They were going to shoot the tear gas from armored vehicles which would protect them and there would be no exchange of fire.  In fact, as you know, an awful lot of shots were fired by the cult members at the federal officials.  There were no shots coming back from the government side.	     	     I asked a number of questions.  The first question I asked is, why now?  We have waited seven weeks; why now?  The reasons I was given were the following:	     	     Number one, that there was a limit to how long the federal authorities could maintain with their limited resources the quality and intensity of coverage by experts there.  They might be needed in other parts of the country.	     	     Number two, that the people who had reviewed this had never seen a case quite like this one before, and they were convinced that no progress had been made recently and no progress was going to be made through the normal means of getting Koresh and the other cult members to come out.  	     	     Number three, that the danger of their doing something to themselves or to others was likely to increase, not decrease, with the passage of time.	     	     And number four, that they had reason to believe that the children who were still inside the compound were being abused significantly, as well as being forced to live in unsanitary and unsafe conditions.	     	     So for those reasons, they wanted to move at that time.  The second question I asked the Attorney General is whether they had given consideration to all of the things that could go wrong and evaluated them against what might happen that was good.  She said that the FBI personnel on the scene and those working with them were convinced that the chances of bad things happening would only increase with the passage of time.	     	     The third question I asked was, has the military been consulted?  As soon as the initial tragedy came to light in Waco, that's the first thing I asked to be done, because it was obvious that this was not a typical law enforcement situation.  Military people were then brought in, helped to analyze the situation and some of the problems that were presented by it.   And so I asked if the military had been consulted.  The Attorney General said that they had, and that they were in basic agreement that there was only one minor tactical difference of opinion between the FBI and the military -- something that both sides thought was not of overwhelming significance.	     	     Having asked those questions and gotten those answers, I said that if she thought it was the right thing to do, that she should proceed and that I would support it.  And I stand by that today.	     	     Q	  Mr. President --	     	     THE PRESIDENT:  Wait.  Go ahead.	     	     Q	  Can you address the widespread perception --reported widely, television, radio and newspapers -- that you were trying somehow to distance yourself from this disaster?	     	     THE PRESIDENT:  No, I'm bewildered by it.  The only reason I made no public statement yesterday -- let me say -- the only reason I made no public statement yesterday is that I had nothing to add to what was being said and I literally did not know until rather late in the day whether anybody was still alive other than those who had been actually seen and taken to the hospital or taken into custody.  It was purely and simply a question of waiting for events to unfold.  	     	     There was -- I have -- I can't account for why people speculated one way or the other, but I talked to the Attorney General on the day before the action took place.  I talked to her yesterday.  I called her again late last night after she appeared on the Larry King Show, and I talked to her again this morning.  A President -- it is not possible for a President to distance himself from things that happen when the federal government is in control.	     	     I will say this, however.  I was, frankly, surprised would be a mild word, to say that anyone that would suggest that the Attorney General should resign because some religious fanatics murdered themselves.  (Applause.)  	     	     I regret what happened, but it is not possible in this life to control the behavior of others in every circumstance.  These people killed four federal officials in the line of duty.  They were heavily armed.  They fired on federal officials yesterday repeatedly, and they were never fired back on.  We did everything we could to avoid the loss of life.  They made the decision to immolate themselves.  And I regret it terribly, and I feel awful about the children.  	     	     But in the end, the last comment I had from Janet Reno, is when -- and I talked to her on Sunday -- I said, now, I want you to tell me once more why you believe -- not why they believe -- why you believe we should move now rather than wait some more.  And she said, it's because of the children.  They have evidence that those children are still being abused and that they're in increasingly unsafe conditions, and that they don't think it will get any easier with time -- with the passage of time.  I have to take their word for that.  So that is where I think things stand.	     	     Q	  Can we assume then that you don't think this was mishandled in view of the outcome, that you didn't run out of patience?  And if you had it to do over again, would you really decide that way?	     	     THE PRESIDENT:  No -- well, I think what you can assume is just exactly what I announced today.  This is a -- the FBI has done a lot of things right for this country over a long period of time.  This is the same FBI that found the people that bombed the World Trade Center in lickety-split, record time.  We want an inquiry to analyze the steps along the way.  Is there something else we should have known?  Is there some other question they should have asked?  Is there some other question I should have asked?  Can I say for sure that no one -- that we could have done nothing else to make the outcome come different?  I don't know that.  That's why I want the inquiry and that's why I would like to make sure that we have some independent law enforcement people, not political people, but totally non-political, outside experts who can bring to bear the best evidence we have.  	     	     There is, unfortunately, a rise in this sort of fanaticism all across the world.  And we may have to confront it again.  And I want to know whether there is anything we can do, particularly when there are children involved.  But I do think it is important to recognize that the wrong-doers in this case were the people who killed others and then killed themselves.	     	     Q	  Mr. President, were there any other options presented to you for resolving this situation at any point from February 28th until yesterday?	     	     THE PRESIDENT:  Well, yes, I got regular reports all along the way.  There were lots of other options pursued.  If you go back -- you all covered it very well.  The FBI -- you did a very good job of it.  I mean, the FBI and the other authorities there pursued any number of other options all along the way, and a lot of them early on seemed to be working.  Some of the children got out, some of the other people left.  There was a -- at one point, there seemed to be some lines of communication opening up between Koresh and the authorities.  And then he would say things and not do them and things just began to spin downward.  	     	     Whether there were other -- in terms of what happened yesterday, the conversation I had with the Attorney General did not involve other options except whether we should take more time with the present strategy we were pursuing -- because they said they wanted to do this, because they thought this was the best way to get people out of the compound quickly before they could kill themselves.  That's what they thought.	     	     Q	  Did the government know that the children did not have gas masks?	     	     Q	     congressional hearings once the situation -- are you in agreement with that?	     	     THE PRESIDENT:  That's up to the Congress.  They can do whatever they want.  But I think it's very important that the Treasury and Justice Departments launch this investigation and bring in some outside experts.  And as I said in my statement, if any congressional committees want to look into it, we will fully cooperate.  There is nothing to hide here.  This was probably the most well-covered operation of its kind in the history of the country.	     	     Go ahead, Sarah.	     	     Q	  There are two questions I want to ask you.  The first is, I think that they knew very well that the children did not have gas masks while the adults did, so the children had no chance because this gas was very -- she said it was not lethal, but it was very dangerous to the children and they could not have survived without gas masks.  And on February 28th -- let's go back -- didn't those people have a right to practice their religion?	     	     THE PRESIDENT:  They were not just practicing their religion, they were -- the Treasury Department believed that they had violated federal laws, any number of them.	     	     Q	  What federal laws --	     	     THE PRESIDENT:  Let me go back and answer -- I can't answer the question about the gas masks, except to tell you that the whole purpose of using the tear gas was that it had been tested; they were convinced that it wouldn't kill either a child or an adult but it would force anybody that breathed it to run outside.  And one of the things that I've heard -- I don't want to get into the details of this because I don't know -- but one of the things that they were speculating about today was that the wind was blowing so fast that the windows might have been opened and some of the gas might have escaped and that may be why it didn't have the desired effect.  	     	     They also knew, Sarah, that there was an underground compound -- a bus buried underground where the children could be sent.  And they were -- I think they were hoping very much that if the children were not released immediately outside that the humane thing would be done and that the children would be sent someplace where they could be protected.  	     	     In terms of the gas masks themselves, I learned yesterday -- I did not ask this fact question before -- that the gas was supposed to stay active in the compound longer than the gas masks themselves were to work.  So that it was thought that even if they all had gas masks, that eventually the gas would force them out in a nonviolent, nonshooting circumstance.	     	     MS. MYERS:  Last question.	     	     Q	  Mr. President, why are you still saying that --	     	     Q	  Could you tell us whether or not you ever asked Janet Reno about the possibility of a mass suicide?  And when you learned about the actual fire and explosion what went through your mind during those horrendous moments?	     	     THE PRESIDENT:  What I asked Janet Reno is if they had considered all the worse things that could happen.  And she said --and, of course, the whole issue of suicide had been raised in the public -- he had -- that had been debated anyway.  And she said that the people who were most knowledgeable  about these kinds of issues concluded that there was no greater risk of that now than there would be tomorrow or the next day or the day after that or at anytime in the future.  That was the judgment they made.  Whether they were right or wrong, of course, we will never know. 	     	     What happened when I saw the fire, when I saw the building burning?  I was sick.  I felt terrible.  And my immediate concern was whether the children had gotten out and whether they were escaping or whether they were inside, trying to burn themselves up.  That's the first thing I wanted to know.  	     	     Thank you.	     	     Q	  Mr. President, why are you still saying it was a Janet Reno decision?  Isn't it, in the end, your decision?	     	     THE PRESIDENT:  Well, what I'm saying is that I didn't have a four- or five-hour, detailed briefing from the FBI.  I didn't go over every strategic part of it.  It is a decision for which I take responsibility.  I'm the President of the United States and I signed off on the general decision and giving her the authority to make the last call.  When I talked to her on Sunday, some time had elapsed.  She might have made a decision to change her mind.  I said, if you decide to go forward with this tomorrow, I will support you. And I do support her.  	     	     She is not ultimately responsible to the American people; I am.  But I think she has conducted her duties in an appropriate fashion and she has dealt with this situation I think as well as she could have.  	     	     Thank you.

From: eder@hsvaic.boeing.com (Dani Eder)Subject: Re: Guns for SpaceOkay, lets get the record straight on the Livermore gas gun.  The project manager is Dr. John Hunter, and he works for theLaser group at Livermore.  What, you may ask, does gas gunshave to do with lasers? Nothing, really, but the gun is physicallylocated across the road from the Free Electron Laser building,and the FEL building has a heavily shielded control room (thick walls)from which the gun firings are controlled.  So I suspect that theoffice he works for is an administrative convenience.I visited Hunter at the beginning of Feb. and we toured the gun.At the time I was working on gas gun R&D at Boeing, where I work,but I am now doing other things (helping to save the space station),The gun uses a methane-air mixture, which is burned in a chamberabout 200 ft long by 16 inch ID (i.e. it looks like a pipe).The chamber holds a 1 ton piston which is propelled at severalhundred m/s down the chamber.  On the other side of the pistonis hudrogen gas, initially at room temperature andsome tensof atmospheres.The piston compresses and heats the hydrogen ahead of it untila stainless steel burst diaphragm ruptures, at around 50,000 psi.The barrel of the gun is about 100 feet long and has a 4 inchbore.  It is mounted at right angles to the chamber (i.e. theyintersect).  This was done so that in the future, the barrelcould be raised and the gun fired into the air without having tomove the larger and heavier chamber.  The projectile being usedin testing is a 5 kg cylinder of Lexan plastic, 4 in in diameterand about 50 cm long.All of the acceleration comes from the expansion of the hydrogengas from 50,000 psi downwards until the projectile leaves thebarrel.  The barrel is evacuated, and the end is sealed with asheet of plastic film (a little thicker than Saran wrap).  Theplastic is blown off by the small amount of residual air trappedin the barrel ahead of the projectile.  The gun is fired into a bunker filled with sandbags and plasticwater jugs.  In the early testing fragments of the plasticprojectile were found.  At the higher speeds in later testing,the projectile vaporizes.The testing is into a bunker because the Livermore test range isabout 3 miles across, and the projectile would go 100-200 kmif fired for maximum range.  The intent is to move the whole gunto Vandenberg AFB after the testing is complete, where they canfire into the Pacific Ocean, and use the tracking radar at VAFBto follow the projectiles.The design goal of the gun is to throw a 5 kg projectile at 4km/s (half of orbital speed).  So far they have reached 2 km/s,and the gun is currently down for repairs, as on the last testthey blew a seal and damaged some of the hardware (I think ithad to do with the methane-air more detonating than burning, butI haven't had a chance to talk to Hunter directly on this).There are people waiting to test scramjet components in thisgun by firing then out of the gun into the air (at Mach 12=4 km/s), since the most you can get in wind tunnels is Mach 8.This gun cost about 4 million to develop, and is basicallya proof-of-concept for a bigger gun capable of firing useful-sized payloads into space.  This would require on the order of100 kg projectiles, which deliver on the order of 20 kguseful payload to orbit.Dani Eder-- Dani Eder/Meridian Investment Company/(205)464-2697(w)/232-7467(h)/Rt.1, Box 188-2, Athens AL 35611/Location: 34deg 37' N 86deg 43' W +100m alt.	sci.space

At least in PIttsburgh, we had a network preemptionchannel which showed all netwoork shows prempted by the local affiliate.I asked them what their problem was. I told them that a local 1.9 rating wasnot that bad considering it was the first NHL game shown after a long timewithout much promotion. Besides, their syndicated programming in the afternoonis usually low rated. So what did they have to lose by showing NHL playoffs.She told me that they had contractual obligations.

From: <A54SI@CUNYVM.BITNET>Subject: Re: Merlin, Mithras and MagickWhat an exciting thread (finally!)Mitra is Sanskrit for Friend, as such He started out as an avatar of Lord Visnu mentioned first in the Vedas. Later he seems to have risen to chief prominence worshipped by the Persians. Associated with the Sun but NOT the Sun, he is the lord of contract honor and obedience, therefore naturally worshipped by soldiers. He was ordered by the Sun to slay the bull of heaven and He reluct- antly agreed because of His obligation...the blood of that bull spilled and grew all earth life...then Mitra and the Sun sat down to eat.Worship of Lord Mitra ended in Persia with the ascension of the Zoroastrians.Hundreds of years later He was rediscovered and thrown into the Official Roman Pantheon (tm) for some semi-tricky reason, I forget why. But all references of Him ended abruptly when He was stricken from same, so apparently His worship was some sort of vehicle for advancement in the bureaucracy, like membership in the Communist Party was in the Soviet Bloc. The sociology of religion in ancient times is fascinating!Oh, His B-day was 25 Dec. Ahem.I am not sure if the mystery cult really lasted after His was booted from the Roman Imperial God Roster or what. It contained mostly soldiers, with 7 levels of initiation. They worshipped underground in caverns in pews. The bull horns in those temples were for scaring away or impaling evil spirits, I'm not sure that they had Mithraic significance or not.I don't know that the ritual meal was of a cannibalistic nature as is the Christian masses. But eating deities goes way back to Old Kingdom Egypt.Someone mentioned bullfighting. Did Mithraists sacrifice bulls? I forget. More likely, for a religious source, might be the shower of bull's blood enjoyed by the worshippers of Cybele on the Day of Blood? Cybele worship extended all throughout even up to France bigtime.-------CHARLES HOPE   A54SI@CUNYVM   A54SI@CUNYVM.CUNY.EDUGOVERNMENT BY REPORTERS...MEDIA-OCRACY.	talk.religion.misc

From: wellison@kuhub.cc.ukans.eduSubject: Re: electronic odometersI had the insturment panel go out in my car (a 1990 Lincoln Contenintal) whichis a digital dash. They replaced the whole thing with a 1991 dash (thank god itwas under the warrenty ! :-) Anyway, the odometer was reading the exact milagefrom the old panel. It must have a EEPROM of some sort in it that is up-dated.Seems to me that removing the battery would erase it, but it doesn't. So Iguess they swapped the NVM chip (non-volitile memory) and installed it in thenew dash. No, they wouldn't let me have the old dash to tinker with :-(-=-= Wes =-=-	sci.electronics
"From: jeffjc@cs.mcgill.ca (Jeffrey CHANCE)Subject: Peace Run '93                     Welcome to the Peace Run                     You're invited to join in                     a Global Relay Run... and                     help light the Way.                     ----  Why the Peace Run  ----There's a new spirit in the Nineties: a spirit of oneness, a growingbelief in the possibility of true global peace.The goal of the Sri Chinmoy Oneness-Home Peace Run is simple: tobring this spirit forward in a concrete way, to transform it intoa reality in their own lives.Every other year, thousands of men, women and children from morethan 70 nations - passing a flaming Peace Torch from hand to hand -join together in a relay run that virtually circles the globe.Transcending political and cultural boundaries, they go fromnation to nation - across mountains, jungles and deserts - carryingthe message of brotherhood to all humankind.Each person who holds or runs with the Peace Torch lights a pathfor those who follow. Each time the Peace Torch changes hands, theflame of oneness burns a little brighter - until one day it willshine in the hearts and minds of every individual on earth.		    ----  Making History  ----The three Peace Runs since 1987 have achieved some historic break-throughs: in the Middle East, a landmark run crossed the Egyptian-Israeli border; in Europe, a precedent-setting run linked Easternand Western Europe with Russia; in the United States, Mexico andCanada, entire cities were dedicated to the cause of world peace;and in Poland, the Peace Torch was blessed by Pope John Paul II.		 ----  Speaking as One: World  ----             ----  Leaders, Celebrities - and You  ----The Peace Run has won the support of leaders the world over -Presidents, Prime Ministers, religious leaders, sports figures andentertainment personalities.Its message has spread to a half billion people though newspaperreports, magazine articles and radio and TV broadcasts, includingspecials on PBS, MTV and NBC's Today Show.> ""I am happy to support your Peace Run for justice, peace andreconciliation. The world must know that God wants us to liveamicably as brothers and sisters, members of one family, the humanfamily, God's family.""  - Archbishop Desmond Tutu,			  Nobel Peace Prize Winner		   ----  How It All Works  ----Peace Run 1993 started with a five-borrough relay in New YorkCity on Saturday April 17, converging at various points to leadup to the opening ceremony outside the United Nations DagHammarskjold Building. There, runners from around the worldwere gathered for the fourth lighting of the Peace Torch.From there, Peace Torches are now being transported to overseventy countries for a series of concurrent international orcross-country relay runs including the United States, Canada,Japan, Australia, Russia and Eastern and Western Europe. Smallerruns will take place in the Philippines, Mexico, Israel, SouthAmerica, Egypt and elsewhere in Africa. Distance to be covered:31,000 miles.>""The Peace Run wil do much to inspire the hearts and stimulatethe minds of those who support, participate in, witness, or hearabout the event.""  - Carl Lewis,                     Six-Time Olympic Gold Medalist                  ----  Who's Behind It  ----The Peace Run is sponsored by the Sri Chinmoy Marathon Team, aninternational running organization that believes sports can be apowerful instrument for promoting world peace. Each year the Teamputs on hundreds of athletic events, including several world-classultramarathons, marathons and triathlons, in dozens of countries.The Peace Run itself is inspired by the global peace ambassadorSri Chinmoy, who has written and lectured extensively on peace,offered hundreds of free peace concerts and met with countlessworld figures to advance the cause of international harmony.The Run is managed by Peace Runs International, a non-profitorganization based in the United States.               ----  Take a Step For Peace  ----The Peace Runs in 1987, 1989 and 1991 attracted nearly half amillion participants. We're expecting even more people to joinPeace Run '93.You can also join the Run - carrying the Peace Torch a few steps,a few blocks or a few miles. Or you can come out and cheer therunners as they carry the Torch through your community.You can also join local celebrities and government officials inone of the thousands of welcoming ceremonies scheduled along the70-nation route.Your inner support is important too. If you're a runner, each timeyou go out, you can dedicate your run to the cause of world peace.		 ----  The Next Step is Yours  ----		 ----  Make It One For Peace  ----For information contact:Peace Runs International161-44 Normal RoadJamaica, NY 11432 USAtel. 718/291-6637  Fax: 718/291-6978Peace Run Canada2456 Agricola StreetHalifax, Nova Scotia  B3K 4C2tel. 902/425-1174  Fax: 902/420-0773or for the phone number or address ofa Peace Run office in your town or country,reply to this message by e-mail."	talk.religion.misc

"From: Marc VanHeyningen <mvanheyn@cs.indiana.edu>Subject: How does it really work? (was Re: text of White House announcement and Q&As on clipper chip encryption)This announcement is somewhat disconcerting; it doesn't do anythingevil in and of itself, but bodes badly for the future of openalgorithms and standards in information security.  I won't startpanicking until/unless DES or RSA or stuff like that is prohibited, butI'm a little anxious.  (No doubt it won't be long before someone postsexplaining how this just a small part of some far-ranging andlong-lived NSA-PKP-IRS-FBI-CIA-HandgunControlInc-Clinton conspiracy tosubvert freedom, democracy, and mathematics.)  My feeling is that theadministration probably isn't that worried about things like DES andRSA and PGP and RIPEM, since they'll never be used by a group muchwider than us computer geeks.The fact that this just came out now suggests one of two things:1.  The NSA has been working on this for a long time, and it only just    now happened to be ``ready'' to release to the world at this time.2.  The NSA has been working on this for a long time, but wasn't able    to get the Bush administration to go along with this plan.  (I    find it unlikely that this would have been because of a sympathy    for the unescrowed use of cryptography; more likely the    administration felt that even escrowed, secret-algorithm and, for    all we know, trivially breakable cryptography should not be made    widely available.)Thus said clipper@csrc.ncsl.nist.gov (Clipper Chip Announcement):>This new technology will help companies protect proprietary>information, protect the privacy of personal phone conversations>and prevent unauthorized release of data transmitted>electronically.  At the same time this technology preserves the>ability of federal, state and local law enforcement agencies to>intercept lawfully the phone conversations of criminals. The majority of the discussion involving this ""Clipper Chip"" seems topertain to the encryption of telephone conversations.  Does anyoneknow if that means this chip is designed to work primarily with analogsignals?  The language sort of suggests this, but it's hard to say.The main thing I just don't get is whether this chip implementssymmetric or asymmetric cryptographic techniques.  Anybody know?I'm guessing symmetric, but they don't get very clear about it.  If itis symmetric, how is it useful for anything other than link-levelencryption with an identical chip at each end?  How can you negotiatea per-session key using symmetric cryptography without using a trustedthird party who knows your key?  (Or does it even use a per-sessionkey?)If it's asymmetric, what about PKP's patents, which they claim coverall methods of doing asymmetric cryptography?  Are they gettingroyalties, or is hiding infringement the real reason for keeping thealgorithm secret? :-)--Marc VanHeyningen   mvanheyn@cs.indiana.edu   MIME & RIPEM acceptedKirk:  I won't hurt you.Alien: You hit me!Kirk:  Well, I won't hit you again."	sci.crypt

All production would have to be   local.  There are not all that many people who have both the skill   AND motivation to assemble worthwhile firearms from scratch.   High-ranking crime figures could obtain imported Uzis and such, but   the average person, and average thug, would be lucky to get a zip-gun   - and would pay through the nose for it.Good point you make.  However, a zip gun, by definition, is a crude,homemade gun--certainly not something capable of sustained, accuratefire, but it would be useful as a means of getting a normal gun.  Recallthe tiny, single-shot pistols made by the Allies during World War II foruse by partisans.  They were essentially well-made zipguns, incapable ofeffective fire beyond a few feet.  But they were useful as a means ofkilling German soldiers for their guns.Also note that the crowd-pleasin' favorite, the Sten gun, wasspecifically designed to require as little machine work as possible.The point's been made here that one could make a Sten clone with steeltubing, hand tools and a welder.I still think that while the point is good, I think there's a differencebetween marijuana and firearms, in that quality marijuana can be grownlocally; there's no need to import the stuff.  If guns are banned, Ithink the demand for ""real"" guns will be sufficient to make smugglingeconomically feasible, thus rendering a ban moot.  In any case, theresult would be the same--people who aren't criminals won't havefirearms, and ""bad guys"" will continue to have access to them, one wayor another.

If anyone knows what can be causing this, please let me know.Most likely reason is that your backup battery is failing - this battery maintains the contents of the CMOS memory when AC power is turned off, andif the battery is flakey then the contents of the CMOS will be lost and the checksum will be wrong (along with most other of the CMOS data). Try replacing the battery.If, however, your PC doesn't use a battery but a large capacitor to powerthe CMOS, you should check to see if you can replace the capacitor with a more normal lithium battery. If this isn't possible, make sure you leaveyour PC on for a half hour or hour each day; this will keep the capacitor charged. I'd opt for the battery change, though.It's also possible, but unlikely that a rogue problem or even a virus is corrupting the CMOS. If your battery seems okay, get a virus scanner andcheck out your system.	comp.sys.ibm.pc.hardware

Mymachine (4DX2-66V) this past Friday. This was two weeks to the DAY fromwhen I called the order in.    Upon unboxing it I found everything to be in perfect order. All the peripherals I ordered were properly installed (Jumbo-250 & CD-ROM). Iwas very impressed with the quantity and quality of the Gateway documentation. All software came with the original disks and manuals.The Gateway manual itself is in a nice 3-ring binder. The ATI GUP camewith build59 drivers. All other software I specified (Microsoft Office)was properly installed. The machine came right up out of the box and has been performing flawlessly. It's been on all weekend and it hardlyeven reaches room temperature. I think the big roomy tower case has a lot to do with it.    It's up and running DOS 6.0 with no problems. I've also read aboutsome people having problems with high speed serial communications. I used the DOS 6.0 InterLink program which lets me link to my oldcomputer via a serial port at 115.2K baud. It then ""maps"" the othermachines two hard disks as my disks F & G. You can ""cd"" to thesedrives and either run programs or copy files. It's almost like apeer-peer lan except you can also *run* programs on the other machine.It's not a two way street. The other machine is the server and thismachine is the client. So thats where it seems to differ from the peer to peer stuff. For a bundled DOS utility its very impressive.   My Jumbo-250 took about 11 minutes to back up 117MB of data. I alsoby-passed any potential Gateway monitor problems by taking the $430credit and applying it towards a NEC 4FG. I love this monitor!

Anyone else think so?Back in the 70's I was a service technician for a cash register company.The cash registers used microprocessor circuits and back then they wereVERY susceptible to electrostatic discharge and line noise.  The biggestproblems came from outlets that were not properly grounded.In almost every place we went to do an installation, we found outletswith the ground connected to the neutral.  For 99.9% of the things youcan plug into one of these, they work fine.  For our cash registers theywere a nightmare -- line noise tended to scramble the memoryperiodically.With modern electronics using switching power supplies this should beless of a problem.  Even the company I used to work for is no longerrecommending a dedicated line with a seperate ground for theirequipment.  I imagine if you check MOST household wiring you will findthat the ground and neutral are connected.  Although not ideal, itshould be o.k. for most applications.--- . SLMR 2.1 .

I tend to agree that players are not hurt by early play in the big leagues.The BRaves organization is a fertile ground to test this hypothesis, as theyhad little talent on their roster for some time.  Steve Avery, for example,was rushed to the majors, and he fared very poorly during his initial campaign.His subsequent pitching has not been affected by his 5+ ERA during his rookieyear.  Bill James pointed out that it was relatively unusual to struggle soand then rebound.Bob Horner was also rushed to the majors (out of Arizona State directly) hadgood numbers immediately.I am not certain of the ages of people like Pete Smith, Craig McMurty, andDerek Lilliquist.  The Braves pitching staffs were so bad when they came upthat they might have been rushed.  Lilliquist and Smith struggled, but itdidn't hurt PS and DL may have been overhyped.

Indurkhya                      TUTORIAL PROGRAMTutorials will be conducted at the Bethesda Ramada Hotel on Tuesday, July 6.12:00-2:45pm ""Introduction to Molecular Biology for Computer  Scientists""  Prof. Mick Noordewier (Rutgers University)This overview of the essential facts of molecular biology is intended as an introduction to the field for computer scientists who wish to apply their tools to this rich and complex domain.  Material covered will include structural and informational molecules, the basic organization of the cell and of genetic material, the ""central dogma"" of gene expression, and selected other topics in the area of structure, function, and regulation as relates to current computational approaches.  Dr. Noordewier has appointments in both Computer Science and Biology at Rutgers, and has extensive experience in basic biological research in addition to his current work in computational biology.12:00-2:45pm ""Introduction to Artificial Intelligence for  Biologists""  Dr. Richard Lathrop (MIT & Arris Corp.)An overview of the field of artificial intelligence will be presented, as it relates to actual and potential biological applications.  Fundamental techniques, symbolic programming languages, and notions of search will be discussed, as well as selected topics in somewhat greater detail, such as knowledge representation, inference, and machine learning.  The intended audience includes biologists with some computational background, but no extensive exposure to artificial intelligence.  Dr. Lathrop, co-developer of ARIADNE and related technologies, has worked in the area of artificial intelligence applied to biological problems in both academia and industry.3:00-5:45pm ""Neural Networks, Statistics, and Information Theory  in Biological Sequence Analysis"" Dr. Alan Lapedes (Los Alamos  National Laboratory) This tutorial will cover the most rapidly-expanding facet of intelligent systems for molecular biology, that of machine learning techniques applied to sequence analysis.  Closely interrelated topics to be addressed include the use of artifical neural networks to elicit both specific signals and general characteristics of sequences, and the relationship of such approaches to statistical techniques and information-theoretic views of sequence data.  Dr. Lapedes, of the Theoretical Division at Los Alamos, has long been a leader in the use of such techniques in this domain.3:00-5:45pm ""Genetic Algorithms and Genetic Programming""  Prof. John Koza (Stanford University)The genetic algorithm, an increasingly popular approach to highly non-linear multi-dimensional optimization problems, was originally inspired by a biological metaphor.  This tutorial will cover both the biological motivations, and the actual implementation and characteristics of the algorithm.  Genetic Programming, an extension well-suited to problems where the discovery of the size and shape of the solution is a major part of the problem, will also be addressed.  Particular attention will be paid to biological applications, and to identifying resources and software that will permit attendees to begin using the methods.  Dr. Koza, a Consulting Professor of Computer Science at Stanford, has taught this subject since 1988 and is the author of a standard text in the field.3:00-5:45pm ""Linguistic Methods in Sequence Analysis""  Prof. David Searls (University of Pennsylvania)  & Shmuel Pietrokovski (Weizmann Institute)Approaches to sequence analysis based on linguistic methodologies are increasingly in evidence.  These involve the adaptation of tools and techniques from computational linguistics for syntactic pattern recognition and gene prediction, the classification of genetic structures and phenomena using formal language theory, the identification of significant vocabularies and overlapping codes in sequence data, and sequence comparison reflecting taxonomic and functional relatedness.  Dr. Searls, who holds research faculty appointments in both Genetics and Computer Science at Penn, represents the branch of this field that considers higher-order syntactic approaches to sequence data, while Shmuel Pietrokovski has studied and published with Prof. Edward Trifinov in the area of word-based analyses.

Your problem in the wet is call hydroplaning.You may not have enough tread left to channel water out from under thetire - so it goes fishy on you as it lifts off the road.(2) Tires age. In particular, soft tire compounds get harder as you putthem thru more heat cycles. Harder compounds don't grip as well assoft ones. Effect is very noticable on tires that get very hot veryoften, such as in competition, but it hits all tires.Bob Benson 	rec.autos

The issue was not the number of pages the book has..or the year first published..  And you tried to hide the whole point.. the point is that both books have the exactly the same quotes about how moslems are killed, tortured,etc by Armenians..and those quotes given  by Serdar Argic exist!!  It was the issue, wasn't-it?    you were not able to object it...Does it bother you anyway?   You name all these tortures and murders (by Armenians) as a ""crap""..

You should indeed be happy to know that you rekindled a huge discussion ondistortions propagated by several of your contemporaries. If you feel that you can simply act as an Armenian governmental crony in this forum you will be sadly mistaken and duly embarrassed. This is not a lecture to another historical revisionist and a genocide apologist, but a fact.I will dissect article-by-article, paragraph-by-paragraph, line-by-line, lie-by-lie, revision-by-revision, written by those on this net, who plan to 'prove' that the Armenian genocide of 2.5 million Turks and Kurds is nothing less than a classic un-redressed genocide. We are neither in x-Soviet Union, nor in some similar ultra-nationalist fascist dictatorship, that employs the dictates of Hitler to quell domestic unrest. Also, feel free to distribute all responses to your nearest ASALA/SDPA/ARF terrorists,the Armenian pseudo-scholars, or to those affiliated with the Armeniancriminal organizations.Armenian government got away with the genocide of 2.5 million Turkish men,women and children and is enjoying the fruits of that genocide.

"From: thompson@apple.com (Paul Thompson)Subject: Tickets - advice is worth what you paidI can't think of another subject that generates as much contradictoryadvice as traffic laws and their enforcement.  Everybody's got anopinion and is dead certain they are right.  Yet acurate information isextremely difficult to come by.  The DMV doesn't know.  Cops don'tknow.  Your traffic school instructor doesn't know.  The vehicle codeonly tells part of the story.  Judges choose to interpret the laws in awide variety of ways.  And the public at large?  I seldom hear anyadvice that doesn't disagree with something I've experienced.If you don't believe me I suggest you get a copy of the vehicle code,study it, and then sit in on a day or two of court and see what reallyhappens.  Read ""Fight Your Ticket"" too, but don't miss the littlesection at the end where it says your chances are lousy and you'rebasically screwed.As you may have guessed, I'm pretty down on the system here inCalifornia.

OPEN LOOK is a specification of a Graphical User Interface (GUI).    A GUI determines the `look and feel' of a system -- the shape of    windows, buttons and scroll-bars, how you resize things, how you    edit files, etc.    The OPEN LOOK GUI is specified, developed and maintained jointly by    Sun Microsystems and AT&T (or USL?).    See Also:	Bibliography@ What is OpenWindows?    OpenWindows is a windowing environment that conforms to the OPEN LOOK    Graphical User Interface Specifications.  It's compatible with the    X11 window system from MIT as well as (currently) Sun's NeWS and SunView,    so you can intermix programs written for any of those systems.    It comes from Sun and also with System V Release 4 from certain vendors.    OpenWindows is sometimes also called openwin or xnews, after the    program used to start it and the main executable itself, respectively.    It should not be called `Windows' or 'OPEN LOOK' or `OpenLook', as    these terms are either wrong or apply to something else.    A commerical OpenWindows source licence costs about $5,000 for the server,    plus about $25,000 for DeskSet, and another $40,000 for ToolTalk.    The current versions of OpenWindows for various platforms are:	SunOS 4.1.1 on Sun 3: 2.0	Solaris 1.x (SunOS 4.1.x) on SPARC: 3.0	Solaris 2.0 (SunOS 5) on SPARC: 3.0.1    See Also:	Mixing X11 and OpenWindows	Where can I get it?@ What are OLIT, XView and TNT?    These are all toolkits for programmers to use in developing programs    that conform to the OPEN LOOK specifications.  See the Bibliography    for documentation on the individual toolkits.  Here's a brief summary:    OLIT was AT&T's OPEN LOOK Intrinsics Toolkit for the X Window system;    it used a widget set, and was probably the easiest for people who were    already X11/Xt programmers to learn.  You could buy the source from AT&T,    although you didn't get the same version tht Sun ship.  Sun includes the    OLIT library in OpenWindows (q.v.); it is also often included in    System V Release 4.  It was written in C.  The release of OLIT in    OpenWindows 3.0 was OLIT 3.0.  OLIT support passed to USL (then a    division of AT&T, now owned by Novell), who replaced it with MoOLIT (q.v.).    Note that because of the nature of Xt subclassing, you will probably    want or need OLIT source in order to develop a large application or    anything else that uses subclasses.    [see the proceedings of the 1991 X Technical Conference]    XView is Sun's toolkit for X11, written in C.  XView is similar in    programmer interface to SunView.  There's even a shell script to help    migrate source code from SunView to XView.	 XView is often said to be    the easiest toolkit to learn if you are not familiar with X Windows.    The XView toolkit is included in OpenWindows, and full source is    available by anonymous ftp from export.lcs.mit.edu (and elsewhere).    The current version of XView from Sun is 3.0.    Despite rumours to the contrary -- some even from within Sun -- the    XView toolkit is *NOT* about to be dropped by Sun.  XView *will* be    included in the next release of OpenWindows, unlike NeWS.    On the other hand, the XView toolkit is not likely to receive as much    attention from Sun in the future as OLIT.    The NeWS Toolkit (TNT) was an object-oriented programming system based    on the PostScript language and NeWS.  TNT implements many of the    OPEN LOOK interface components required to build the user interface of    an application.  It's currently included in OpenWindows.    The current version of TNT from Sun is 3.1; Release 3 contains some    incompatibilities with `tNt' 1.0 and TNT 2.0, but Sun are committed to    supporting the API, at least until they stop NeWS support some time    later this year and replace it with Display PostScript.  Wail.    You might ask what `is committed to' means in this context; the    answer seems to be that it means absolutely nothing.    Sun currently asserts that it is committed to OLIT, however.    The C++ User Interface Toolkit (UIT) consists of an object-oriented C++    class library layered on top of XView and a tool to generate code from    DevGuide 3 GIL files.  The UIT also includes features that simplify    event management and the use of PostScript and color.  It is said to be    compatible with OpenWindows V2 and V3, and presumably V3.0.1, since the    release mentions that it works on Solaris 2.    UIT is not an official Sun-supported product but an ongoing project of    various people within Sun.  It can be found on export.lcs.mit.edu in    the MIT contrib directory as UITV2.tar.Z (use binary mode!).@ Where does Motif fit in?    It doesn't :-).  Motif is an alternative Graphical User Interface that    is being developed by OSF.	It has a `look and feel' reminiscent of    Microsoft Windows and the OS/2 Presentation Manager.  There are no non-    commercial Motif toolkits available, although the Motif source is sold    reasonably cheaply by OSF.	Although Motif is currently available on    more platforms than OpenWindows, the OPEN LOOK GUI is almost certainly    used on many more machines, simply because Sun (and SysVR4) have such a    large installed base.    Sun's CD/WARE Volume 2 contains a roadmap for improving Motif    applications by converting them to OLIT [:-)]; there are also notes in    the `Periodic Table' OLIT demo, $OPENWINHOME/demo/olittable.@ What is MoOLIT?    MoOLIT is a version of OLIT from AT&T/USL that lets users choose between    a Motif and an OPEN LOOK UI feel at run-time.  It will be part of System V    Release 4.2.    Contact: Joanne Newbauer, jo@usl.com, (908) 522-6677@ What about that Display PostScript thing?    Sun and Adobe have agreed that Sun will include the DPS extension to X    in the next release of OpenWindows.  DPS is essentially a badly designed    hack on top of a slow Level 2 PostScript interpreter intended to give a    very small subset of the functionality of NeWS whilst simultaneously    being harder to use, as I understand it.  The only real advantage it    has over NeWS is that the manual is much smaller, being generally less    complete; DPS is also available on more kinds of machine.    Performance on our RS/6000 is not suitable for interactive work;    what it will be like on the SPARCStation remains to be seen.    Note that whereas X/NeWS fonts are shared by both subsystems, the DPS    extension to X does _not_ make Type 1 PostScript fonts available to    ordinary X11 programs.  It is not like ATM on a PC in this regard.    (there is at least one third-party version which does make fonts    available, however)Subject: Window Managers -- olwm, olvwm@ What are olwm and olvwm?    They are window managers.  A window manager is the part of the X Window    system (e.g. X11) that is responsible for deciding how to lay out windows    on the screen, and for managing the user's interaction with the windows.    Olwm is the standard OPEN LOOK window manager.    It's included with all of the OpenWindows (q.v.) implementations, and    you can also get the source by ftp, since Sun donated it.    Olvwm is a version of olwm that manages a `virtual desktop' (hence the    `v' in its name).  It shows a little map on the screen, with the    currently displayed area represented by a little rectangle.	 You can    move around by dragging the rectangle or with the arrow keys.  This    lets you run several clients (applications) and move the display around    from one to the other.  Olvwm was derived from the OpenWindows 3.0 olwm    by Scott Oaks; you need to have XView 3.0 to compile it.    Get olvwm from an ftp site such as export.lcs.mit.edu (in the contrib    directory; there are three patches).@ Can I use my favorite window manager with OpenWindows instead of olwm?    Yes.  If you use twm, for example, or mwm, you won't be able to use    the Pin and Unpin feature of olwm, and you (probably) won't see the    footers some windows use to display certain messages.    If you use twm, you'll want to use the f.delete function to unpin menus    and get rid of programs that don't have a `quit' button when not run    under olwm.    For twm, put this in your $HOME/.twmrc:	LeftTitleButton ""target"" = f.delete    where ""target"" is a 16x16 icon from /usr/include/X11/bitmaps.    Alternatively, try	# Add a menu to each window managed by twm or tvtwm	LeftTitleButton "":menu"" = f.menu ""OL.menu""	menu ""OL.menu"" {	    ""Quit""         f.delete	}    For mwm, you can double-click on the menu icon on the left of the title    bar to dismiss a pop-up window (I am told).    See the manual page for your window manager (twm, etc).Subject: OpenWindows, Terminals, and Other Displays@ Can I use olwm and olvwm without OpenWindows or on an X Terminal?    The OpenWindows xnews server combines SunView, NeWS (PostScript) and X11.    This means that it can run programs compiled for any of those systems.    Unfortunately, it means that some OpenWindows programs need either NeWS    or SunView support, and thus won't run on an X terminal.  This includes    pageview in particular.    You can use olwm or olvwm (see above) on an X terminal or a non-Open-    Windows display, and most OPEN LOOK clients (e.g. OLIT or XView ones)    will work perfectly well.  You may find that you get complaints about    fonts not being found.  If so, see the Fonts section below.    If you are running the window manager built-in to an NCD terminal, you    may have problems with input focus; setting *Input: True in the terminal's    XDefault file in /usr/lib/X11/xdm may or may not help.Subject: Configuration Files: Getting started with OpenWindows     @ What configuration files do I need to know about?    .xinitrc and .xsessionrc    The first time you run OpenWindows, a .xinitrc file will be created in    your login directory ($HOME).  If it already exists, you might have to    edit it somewhat; it's simplest to move it and any other old X11 files    you have to another directory, and then merge the old and new files.    If your site uses xdm, you should use .xsession instead of .xinitrc,    since xdm doesn't look at your .xinitrc file.    .openwin-init, .openwin-menu and .openwin-sys    These are optional files you can create in your $HOME directory,    depending on which version of olwm or olvwm you use.    Look in $OPENWINHOME/lib (normally /usr/openwin/lib) for these files    without the leading . and copy any you want to change.  You may need    to edit your .xinitrc to get them recognized.  If you are not on an    X terminal, you will want to run a console window (such as cmdtool -C,    shelltool -C, xterm -C) or Chuck Musciano's ""contool"" program so that    system output will be directed there instead of writing over your screen.    Note that .openwin-sys is not executed unless you edit .xinitrc.    .Xdefaults    You can put X Windows resource specifications in here.  In particular,    it is a good idea to include at least:	OpenWindows.FocusLenience:	true	*Input: TRUE    These allow non-ICCCM-compliant programs to receive input even if they    forget to ask for it.    Props, the program that runs when you select `properties' from the default    root menu under olwm or olvwm, writes your choices into .Xdefaults.    Don't put comments in .Xdefaults, since `props' deletes them.    .startup.ps    This is the NeWS user profile file, read by OpenWindows (actually xnews)    on startup.	 This is documented in the NeWS programming manual, near the    back.  The most useful thing to put here is PostScript code to change    the keyboard repeat rate, although you must be very careful, since a    syntax error in the PostScript means that xnews will either not start up    at all or will get broken in strange ways.	The NeWS manual gives code    that is both incorrect and insufficient.    WARNING: things in this file rarely work on both OpenWindows 2 and 3.    Note that the mouse speed is best set in your .xinitrc with xset m; see    the man page for xset (""man xset"", and ""xset -help"") for more information.    Here's what $HOME/.startup.ps  should look like if you want a delay of    about a third of a second (300000 microseconds), and a repeat rate of    twenty or so keys per second (30000 microseconds between repeats) for    OpenWindows 3.  You'll have to experiment a bit because the RepeatTime    is the delay between keys sent, and thus doesn't include the time to    process each key, which is probably higher on my 4/110 than on your    SuperSPARC 10/51 GTi injection :-)  Again, this is for OpenWindows 3...	% don't want the demos - see p. xxxii of NeWS Toolkit Reference Manual	% /IncludeDemos? false def	UserProfile begin	    /KeyRepeatThresh 0 300000 timeval storetimeval def	    /KeyRepeatTime 0 30000 timeval storetimeval def	    % Note: 300000 and 30000 differ greatly...	end    You must also have a .user.ps file in the same directory, like this:	/NeWS 3 0 findpackage beginpackage	/TNTCore 3 0 findpackage beginpackage	/TNT 3 0 findpackage beginpackage	ClassRepeatKeys pop	% force repeat.ps to autoload	endpackage endpackage endpackage    If you change these parameters, you can test them without restarting the    OpenWindows server like this:	$ psh -i .startup.ps	Welcome to X11/NeWS Version3	$ psh -i	Welcome to X11/NeWS Version3	/classinit ClassRepeatKeys send	%%% now press control-D    You can also either of these two files (.startup.ps and .user.ps) to make    the root window be ""retained"", so that a PostScript drawing on the    background won't be erased when you move windows:	frambuffer /Retained true put    will do this.  Note that this may increase the amount of memory used    by the NeWS server (xnews) dramatically.        See also:	Trouble Shooting: It Won't Let Me Type	Trouble Shooting: Is there an easy way to edit Xdefaults?	Environment Variables@ How can I configure OPEN LOOK for a left-handed mouse and keyboard?    You can use xmodmap to change the mouse buttons, but be prepared for one    or two occasional surprises.  See also ""man 7 xview"" for a list of    keybindings you can change, at least for XView programs.    With OpenWindows 2.0, you can use defaultsedit to set the mouse mappings    and then let SunView handle them.  The status returned by svenv should    tell you whether your server is running under SunView or not; put this    in your .xinitrc:    if eval `svenv -env`    then	xmodmap -e ""pointer = 1 2 3""	input_from_defaults    else	xmodmap -e ""pointer = 3 2 1""    fi@ How can I get the screen to go blank when the system is idle?    Run screenblank from /etc/rc.local if you can; it's a boring but    effective screen saver.  See `man screenblank'.    Under Solaris 2 you'll need to copy screenblank from an older system, as    it's not supplied.  Then add a new file in /etc/rc2.d to make the system    run screenblank automatically.Subject: Key Bindings, Cut and Paste@ How do I cut and paste between XTerm and OpenWindows programs?    To go from XTerm to textedit (say):    * Select the text you want to copy by dragging the SELECT mouse button      in xterm    * Press COPY in the XTerm (this key is L6, or Meta+c (the O'Reilly      XView manual gets this wrong)    * Move to the textedit window, and press PASTE (L8 or Meta+v)    If this doesn't work, see Trouble Shooting: Cut and Paste   To go the other way, from textedit to XTerm:    * Select the text in textedit.  No need to use COPY    * Move to the XTerm window and press ADJUST (the middle mouse button).    * You can also use the COPY/CUT and PASTE buttons.@ COPY/PASTE is boring.	 What short-cuts are available?    Quick Copy within textedit, mailtool, etc:    * Click SELECT to get a text caret where you want the copied text to go    * Press and HOLD DOWN the PASTE (or CUT) button    * Select the text you want to copy/move.  You'll see that it's underlined      or crossed out, as appropriate.  (In the jed demo it goes grey)    * Let go of the PASTE (or CUT) button.    * The text you underlined or crossed out appears at the insert caret.    Drag and Drop to Move a Selection    * Select the text you want to copy or move, by dragging or multiple-      clicking the SELECT or ADJUST mouse button    * Put the mouse pointer anywhere within the selection    * Press and HOLD DOWN down the SELECT mouse button, and move the mouse      pointer a little to the right; you'll see the cursor changes to be the      first 3 letters of the text (or some other icon).    * Still holding SELECT down, move the mouse over the point where you want      to drop the text    * You may see the mouse pointer change to a rifle-sight or target, to show      that it's OK to drop things here    * Let go of SELECT, and the text is moved.	This works in text fields of      dialogue boxes as well as in text subwindows.    Drag and Drop to Copy a Selection    * This is the same as using Drag and Drop to Move a Selection, except that      you must hold the CONTROL key down as well as the SELECT mouse button.@ What are the default key bindings in textedit and elsewhere?    See the man page for textedit(1) for some of them.    In general, the editing/moving commands go in the opposite direction when    shifted - e.g. Ctrl+w deletes a word, and Ctrl+W deletes the word to the    right of the insert point.	Meta-i - include file	    Meta-f - find selection (forward/backward)	Ctrl-a - start of line	    Ctrl-< - back word	Ctrl-e - end of line	    Ctrl-> - forward word	Ctrl-w - delete word	    Ctrl-u - delete to start/END of line	Ctrl-Return - move to end/START of document    See the O'Reilly XView Reference Manual for a list of some of the default    keys; see also the olwm or olvwm manual page.@ What can I put in my .ttysrc?	 Where is it documented?    See the manual page for shelltool.Subject: Applications: Finding Out...    Contact SunSoft (or Sun) and ask for the Catalyst OPEN LOOK guide,    which lists over 200 pages of applications, and also the _huge_    Catalyst listing of products for Suns, updated six-monthly.    Sun's free CDWare CD/ROMs each contain demo versions of several popular    OPEN LOOK applications.  Often you can simply contact the vendor    concerned to have the license upgraded from demo, and receive the full    product documentation.    SunPICS produces a CD/ROM for NeWSPrint users, Printer's Pallate, which    contains NeWSprint drivers for a variety of printers and plotters, as    well as 600 scaleable fonts that you can license.    There is a separate FAQ posting in comp.windows.open-look that lists    a number of free and commercial aplications; mail lee@sq.com for a    copy, including OPEN LOOK UI Application List in the Subject for a    faster reply.Subject: DeskSet, Mailtool, Calendar Manager, etc.@ Is there a tty-based interface to cm (Calendar Manager)?    Yes, cm_delete, cm_insert and cm_lookup; these all have manual pages.    If ""man cm_delete"" doesn't work or gives strange messages, see under    Trouble Shooting: Strange Error Messages, below.@ How can I arrange to have my .signature included in my outgoing mail?    The best way is:    $ cd    $ cp /usr/lib/.textswrc .    $ chmod +w .textswrc    edit .textswrc (use vi, textedit, or whatever you prefer)    add the follwing:	KEY_RIGHT(3)    FILTER	cat ~/.signature    (you might need to change ~ to $HOME)    Now pressing R3 will insert your .signature file.Subject: Fonts@ Does OpenWindows support Type 1 PostScript fonts?    Yes, under either Solaris 2.0 or 2.1 (I'm not sure which).    Or, Not Yet, in other words.    If you have FrameMaker there is a utility to import them, I'm told.    The 57 fonts supplied with OpenWindows are fully hinted, though, and    comparing them to the Microsoft Windows and Apple TrueType fonts is    interesting...  The F3 font format is described in a publication from the    Sun OpenFonts group, listed in the Bibliography below.  Documentation on    the unbundled version of TypeScaler is also available from Sun OpenFonts.    You can buy F3 fonts from SunPICS, Monotype, Linotype, URW and probably    other major foundries.    SunPICS' NeWSPrint software supports Type 1 fonts.@ Improving font rendering time    Although the Sun type renderer (TypeScaler) is pretty fast, it's not as    fast as loading a bitmap :-).  You can pre-generate bitmap fonts for sizes    that you use a lot, and you can also alter and access the font cache    parameters.	 If you have a lot of memory you might want to increase the    font cache size.	$ psh -i	Welcome to X11/NeWS Version3 <--- psh will say this at you	currentfontmem =	% type this line ...	300	% and here's whai my server was using -- 300 Kbytes	1024 setfontmem	% Just to check:	currentfontmem =	1024    See pp. 328ff of the NeWS 3.0 Programmer's Guide.  You need to say psh -i    so that the PostScript packages are loaded - see the psh man page.@ Making bitmap fonts for faster startup:	$ mkdir $HOME/myfonts	$ cd $HOME/myfonts	$ makeafb -20 -M $OPENWINHOME/lib/fonts/Bembo.f3b	Creating Bembo20.afb	$ convertfont -b Bembo20.afb	Bembo20.afb->./Bembo20.fb	Chars parameter greater than number of characters supplied.	$ ls	Bembo20.afb	Bembo20.fb	Synonyms.list	$ bldfamily	* Bembo		       ./Bembo.ff (Encoding: latin)	cat: ./Compat.list: No such file or directory	$ xset +fp `pwd`	$ xset fp rehash    If you want the server to see your new font directory every time,    add this directory to your FONTPATH environment variable in one    of your start-up files, e.g. .login or .profile.@ Converting between font formats (convertfont, etc.)    You can also use Folio fonts with an X11 server, by converting them to a    bitmap (X11 bdf format) first.  Your licence forbids you from using the    fonts on another machine, and unless you have NeWSPrint you shouldn't    use them for printing.  Having said all that...  you can use makeafb and    convertfont to generate bdf files that you can compile with bdftosnf or    bdftopcf.    Use mftobdf (from the SeeTeX distribution) to convert TeX pk fonts to    X11 bdf format, which you can then use with either X11 or OenWindows.    You can also use der Mouse's ""getbdf"" to get bdf fonts from a running    X display server -- ftp: larry.mcrcim.mcgill.edu (132.206.1.1) /X/getbdf@ Xview/OLIT fonts at 100 dpi    There aren't any.  More precisely, the various text fonts, such as    Lucida Typewriter Sans, are available at 100 dpi, and in fact are    scalable under OpenWindows.	 The glyph fonts are bitmaps, and don't    scale very well.Subject: Trouble Shooting: Strange Error Messages@ No manual entry for cm_lookup    If man doesn't seem to find OpenWindows commands, even though you are    running OpenWindows, try setting the MANPATH environment variable:	MANPATH=$OPENWINHOME/share/man:/usr/man; export MANPATH    or	setenv MANPATH $OPENWINHOME/share/man:/usr/man    for csh users.  $OPENWINHOME should be /usr/openwin on most systems.@ window: Window creation failed to get new fd @ window: Base frame not passed parent window in environment @ Cannot create base frame.

Some of    the SunView programs are still around in /usr/bin, and have names    that are the same as their OpenWindows counterparts.  You almost    certainly want to run the programs in $OPENWINHOME instead.    Set your path so that $OPENWINHOME/bin (and $OPENWIN/bin/xview for    OpenWindows 2) come before /bin (or /usr/bin, they're the same), or    you'll get the SunView versions of mailtool, cmdtool, shelltool, etc.@ memory fault - core dumped    If you get this from the binder, or if binder vanishes suddenly,    get the following patches:	100493-02 Binder	100524-03 Cetables	100626-03 Tooltalk@ Trouble compiling Xt, Xmu or OLIT programs: _get_wmShellWidgetClass     If you are using OpenWindows 3.0 (X11R4-based Xt), contact your local    Sun office and request the following patches:100512-02   4.1.x OpenWindows 3.0 libXt Jumbo patch100573-03   4.1.x OpenWindows 3.0 undefined symbols when using shared libXmu    If you can't install the patch, a workaround is to add 	-u get_wmShellWidgetClass -u get_applicationShellWidgetClass    on the link (ld or cc ... -o ...) line.  An alternative is to add	-assert nodefinitions    to CFLAGS in your Makefile, or even in Imake.tmpl.Subject: Trouble Shooting: It Won't Let Me Type@ When I try to type into some programs, I just get beeps or nothing happens    It is a good idea to include at least:	OpenWindows.FocusLenience:	true	*Input: TRUE    in your .Xdefaults file, as these allow non-ICCCM-compliant programs to    receive input even if they forget to ask for it.    See the next item for editing .XdefaultsSubject: Trouble Shooting: Cut and Paste not working@ I can't paste from xterm to XView (including Sun DeskSet) programs    Under OpenWindows 2, you need to add the following either to your    $HOME/.Xdefaults file, or to $OPENWINHOME/lib/app-defaults/XTerm instead:	XTerm*VT100.Translations: #override \		<Key>L6:select-set(CLIPBOARD)\n\		<Key>L8:insert-selection(CLIPBOARD)      You must not move the mouse between ending the selection and pressing    L8 (the Paste key)!    Under OpenWindows 3, this is already in the app-defaults file, so if it    isn't working, check that XFILESEARCHPATH is set to	/usr/openwin/lib/%T/%N%S    and if it isn't, either set it or copy/merge the above lines from    $OPENWINHOME/lib/app-defaults/XTerm into /usr/lib/X11/app-defaults/XTerm.

If you alter $HOME/.Xdefaults instead, you must use what X calls a    `more specific' resource name:	xterm.vt100.translations    will do.@ I can't paste from XView (including Sun DeskSet) programs to xterm    If you don't have the Sun L keys on the left of your keyboard, you can    use Meta-x, Meta-c and Meta-v for cut, coy and paste respectively.    You can change the keys by adding the following two lines to    your .Xdefaults file, edited as you wish (the values shown here are the    defaults):	Openwindows.KeyboardCommand.Copy: c+Meta,L6	OpenWindows.KeyboardCommand.Paste"", ""v+Meta,L8        Lists of resources are in the manual page for xview, and also in the    thinnish blue book `Companion to Volume 7, XView Reference Manual' from    O'Reilly, and also in the olwm and olvwm manual pages.@ I always get the same piece of text when I press PASTE (L8, Meta+v)    Remove the file /tmp/textsw_shelf and see if that helps; see also the    next item.@ Cut Copy and Paste don't work at all (OpenWindows only)    Oh dear.  Use ps -xuaww | grep xv  to check that sv_xv_sel_svc is running    and that either you or root started it, depending on whether you started    OpenWindows with ""openwin"" or by logging in through xdm.    If not, start it.  If it dies, check that there is no /tmp/.sv_xv_sel_svc    before restarting it - you may need to be root to remove it, or you can    reboot your workstation.    Check that there is space in /tmp (use ""df /tmp""), and also see if there    are a lot of files there with names like /tmp/tty.txt.a01246; if there are    several hundred of them, cut and paste may take so long that it times out.    Quit any deskset tools such as mailtool, filemgr and cm (calendar), start    a terminal emulator and remove and /tmp/tty.txt* and /tmp/Text* files    that are still there.  It's simplest to quit openwin and start it again    after doing that, if cut and paste was broken, but if it starts working    again you can just carry on.  Note that files in /tmp not owned by you    might be in use by another worker comrade, so don't remove those without    checking first!Subject: Trouble Shooting: Not authorized to use display    If you get error messages that look like	Xlib:  connection to "":0.0"" refused by server	Xlib:  Internal error during connection authorization check	Error: Can't Open display    try, on the machine running OpenWindows or X11,	xhost +machine    where ""machine"" is the computer on which you ran the command that failed.    If you want to let other users run programs on the same machine as you,    using your display, you will have to type the bizarre-looking	xhost +`hostname`    (or xhost +happyboy, if happyboy is the name of your workstation).    This lets ANY user on `happyboy' access your display.    With OpenWindows 3.0 you can also use xauth, and the Programmer's Guide     describes how to do this in Chapter 8, p. 101.  This is more secure.    Also check the man page for fbtab(5) to stop other users accessing the    framebuffer directly!    Also note that there is a Sun patch for OpenWindows 3.0 under SunOS 4.1.1    to fix a serious security problem.  It is available through your local    Sun Answer Center as well as through anonymous ftp from ftp.uu.net    [192.48.96.2] system in /sun-dist:    Fix                     PatchID        Filename            Checksum    loadmodule              1076118        100448-01.tar.Z     04354  5    On an X Terminal, there may be a setup menu that lets you change or    disable the list of hosts that can access the display.    If you start getting this message after you've been logged in overnight,    there might be a cron job that's removing the Unix sockets in /tmp    that are used to communicate with the server when $DISPLAY doesn't have    a hostname before the :, or is empty.

Better still, pick up ""contool"" and run	that.  Get it from export.lcs.mit.edu in the contrib directory.  It	will monitor the console and open, flash its icon or beep when a	message appears; it's very easy to configure.    If ""refresh"" from the Workspace->Utilities menu doesn't make the messages,    go away...	a Sun with a cg4 frame buffer has two screens - you can move the	mouse off the right-hand (by default) edge of the screen and onto	a whole new (but monochrome) display, called "":0.1"".

You can also run switcher -e 0 to get rid of the messages.  Also, see	the note about contool, above.@ Is there an easy way of editing .Xdefaults?    Use `props', which appears in the default root menu as `properties'.    This starts `props', a property editor which will re-write your    .Xdefaults after removing comments.  It then applies any changes.    Keep comments by using ""comment."" instead of ""!"", for example,	comment.*.font: Palatino-Italic-37@ How do I get the File manager to use emacs instead of textedit?    set the default editor to	sh -c ""exec emacs -font lucidasanstypewriter-18 \""$FILE\""""    (you can change the font if you prefer a smaller one)@ How do I run OpenWindows in inverse video?    This tends not to work under OpenWindows 2.	 With OpwnWindows 3.0,    there are various ways, including using -bg and -fg options.  If you're    using OpenWindows 2 on a Sun 3 , probably the best you can do (short of    upgrading the workstation to a SPARC!) is to use xterm instead of cmdtool.@ Why don't flat check-boxes work?    A known bug may make Guide's output dump core if you use these.    A workaround is to edit the Guide output, as it's only Guide's output    that's broken, not the actual check-box code.    This applies only to versions of DevGuide before Devguide 3.0.  If you're    still using an ancient DevGuide, you should upgrade as soon as possible;    the new one is fantastic!@ When I leave OpenWindows, my screen goes blank or my mouse cursor stays  on the screen.    Try running clear_colormap; if this helps, put it as the last line in    the shell script you use to start OpenWindows (e.g. `openwin').@ When I use snapshot, the system crashes, or the server hangs, or something.    This was a bug related to some systems only.  The only work-round was to    use some other screen dump program, such as xwd, xv 2.21 or xgrabsc.    @ Why have some of my function keys stopped working?    Keys F11 and F12 changed from SunF36 and SunF37 to SunXK_F36 and SunXK_F37    respectively in OpenWindows 3.  Applications must be recompiled, or you    might be able to use xmodmap or the public domain xkeycaps program to    change your keyboard layout back again.@ When I type shelltool or cmdtool or textedit, I get the Sunview version    See under ""Trouble Shooting: Strange Error Messages"" below.    (see also next item)@ Mixing X11 and OpenWindows    (see also next item)    Note that OpenWindows 3.0 includes the X11R4 core distribution (to patch    level 18), but not the contrib directory.  These notes apply to    OpenWindows 2.0, although you could also the do same sort of thing with    OpenWindows 3.0 and X11R5.    Install the X11 libraries in /usr/lib/X11.	You can intermix OpenWindows    and X11R4 or X11R5, they're all compatible in this respect.    Put the X11 binaries in (for example) /usr/bin/X11.    Put /usr/bin/X11 last in your PATH, so that you get OpenWindows versions    of programs instead of X11 ones where appropriate, although this is a    matter of preference.  In any event, put the OpenWindows bin directory    first -- see the preceding item for more details on that.  If you have    /bin (or /usr/bin, they're the same directory on SunOS) earlier in    your PATH than $OPENWINHOME/bin/xview, you'll get SunView programs instead    of OpenWindows ones!    Set LD_LIBRARY_PATH so that /usr/openwin/lib is last, after the X11    library directory.	This doesn't matter with OpenWindows 3.0, but with    older versions you'll get error messages from X11 programs if you don't    do this.  The messages are generally harmless (see next item), although    xdm core dumps if this isn't right.    Set OPENWINHOME to the directory containing OpenWindows if it isn't    /usr/openwin.    See Also:	Environment Variables (especially XFILESEARCHPATH).@ I get error messages on my screen about ld.so: libX11.so.4 not found    set LD_LIBRARY_PATH to be /usr/openwin.  If you also use X11, use	     /usr/lib:/usr/5lib:/usr/openwin/lib    If you put this in a shell script or your .profile, use    ${OPENWINHOME-/usr/openwin}/lib instead of /usr/openwin; this is for    /bin/sh; for csh it is different.@ I launch my filemgr and I get ld.so:map heap error (9) at /dev/zero    Your system needs to be patched.  Look in $OPENWINHOME/lib/OSpatches    and install the patch.@ Why doesn't AnswerBook run for me?    You must be running OpenWindows to use AnswerBook.	It won't run under    X11 (on an X terminal or on anything else) because it uses NeWS to draw    the PostScript text and pictures.    If you are using OpenWindows 3.0, you need to use the OpenWindows 3.0    compatible navigator; it's called .navigator.ow3 on the AnswerBook CD/ROM.    If all AnswerBook users are using OpenWindows 3.0, you can replace    navigator wih .navigator.ow3 altogether (rename the old one first to    satisfy your sense of paranoia!)    The navigator.ow3 binary is also on CD/Ware Vol 2.    Note that the data files are in PostScript, so you can look at them with    a PostSript viewer (q.v.).@ Why aren't there any fish in realxfishdb?    A fixed version of realxfishdb is available by ftp from    ftp.eng.auburn.edu [131.204.10.91] as /pub/realxfishdb.Z@ Why is the Properties choice disabled in the Window menu?    It isn't implemented yet.  Many programs do respond to the Properties    Key (L3), though, or have a pop-up menu with Properties on it.@ File completion in the C-shell is broken in cmdtool    Sadly true, but use shelltool or xterm instead and it's fine.  It also    works if you run command tool on a remote machine.    Fixed in OpenWindows 3.0.1 shipped with Solaris 2.@ When I run OLIT programs, some of the widgets are red!    Release 3 of OLIT added mouseless operation; action widgets can be    selected via the keyboard.  The currently selected item is highlighted    in red (the `Red Stain') to show that it has the input focus.    To disable it in most places, add this to your $HOME/.Xdefaults file:	*traversalOn: off	*TextEdit.traversalOn: on	*TextField.traversalOn: on    You can change the color using (for example)	*InputFocusColor: grey50	*input*FocusColor: green	*List*inputFocusColor: <your background color>    See the man page resources(3w), at the start of the OLIT 3 Widget Set    Reference Manual included in the OpenWindows 3 programmer documentation.    Meanwhile contact your distributor and ask for patch id 100451-30, the    OLIT/3.0 CTE Jumbo Patch.@ When I run several programs, the colors on the screen all change when  I move into a different window! (""colormap flashing"")        This is becasue most hardware can only display a few colors at a time.    However, you can minimise the effect with the following procedure:    *  Start all the applications with colors that you wish to reserve.    *  Run	cmap_compact save       to create the .owcolors file    *  Put the line	cmap_compact init       near the start of your start-up file (.xinitrc)    *  Exit and then restart the window system.    *  cmap_compact init will push those colors .owcolors to the end of	the colormap and reserves them.    Also note that control-L2 locks the colors of the current window, and    Control-L4 unlocks them -- this is described in the olwm manual page.@ pageiew uses the wrong colors, or makes the colormap flash (see above):    This problem was reported by people for some reason running the Motif    window manager (mwm) with OpenWindows.    Try running pageview like this:	$OPENWINHOME/bin/reservecolors -svmono	$OPENWINHOME/bin/pageview	$OPENWINHOME/bin/reservecolors -discard@ XDM breaks things    Command tool doesn't like being run without a Unix `controlling terminal'.    Use /etc/setsid to start your command tools and all will be well.    SunView applications may need to be run with svenv, as in	svenv -exec /usr/bin/traffic    because xdm won't set the necessary environment variables.    Note that the MIT xdm starts up the X server as root, which is a security    hole for OpenWindows; use the OpenWindows 3.0 xdm or be aware that your    users can access files and start Unix processes ass root...@ Function keys 11 and 12 stopped working    In OpenWindows 3.0, the X11 names (""keysyms"") for these keys was changed    to SunXK_F36 and SunXK_F37.

PANEL_LIST_FONTS take a NULL terminated list of Xv_opaque font_handles.    There is no easy way to make an entire list fixed width font.    You have to make sure that you always specify PANEL_LIST_FONT when you    insert a new row into that list, or write a convenience function    insert_row(list, row, string) that hides the nasty bits.@ how do I keep an XView pop-up window displayed after a button is pressed?    In the button callback, do        xv_set(button, PANEL_NOTIFY_STATUS, XV_ERROR, NULL);    This will keep the window visible.

The current release of OpenWindows from Sun for supported architectures    is 3.0; for the Sun 3 series it is frozen at OpenWindows 2.0.    Note that Sun includes OpenWindows with SunOS, and it is also included as    the windowing system for Solaris.    There are said (by Sun) to be over 35 ports of OpenWindows either    available now or in progress.  Unfortunately, none of them seem to    be available from anywhere.

The most useful for OPEN LOOK users are:	Volume 1: XLib Programming Manual	Volume 2: XLib Reference Manual	Volume 3: X Window System User's Guide	    (An OPEN LOOK edition of Volume 3 should appear later this year)	Volume 7: XView Programmer's Manual [Dan Heller]	    [make sure you get the 3rd edition for XView 3.0]	Companion to Volume 7: XView Reference Manual [Ed. Thomas Van Raalte]	The Companion to Volume 7 is an expanded version of the Attribute	Summary from the previous edition of the XView Programming Manual,	together with other reference information, so that in practice you	have to buy both books.	O'Reilly also have a thinnish orange book on the differences between	X11R4 and RX115.	OLIT programmers will also want the Xt books - volumes 4 and 5.	There is a new big fat green Vol 5 updated for X11R5.	A journal, The X Resource, may also be of interest.

PostScript Language Tutorial and Cookbook,	Adobe Systems Inc., Addison Wesley, 1985 [""The blue book""]        There's at least one book on using Solaris (i.e. SunOS).    Sun also supplies a large amount of documentation with OpenWindows,    although you may have to order it separately.  Here's what I have; they    are each a little over 21 cm square (wider than A4 paper), and vary from    about 1 cm to about 3cm thick.  They say `User's Guide' or `Programmer's    Guide' on the front.

AT&T includes several large thorny bushes' worth of paper with OLIT.    Sun's AnswerBook CD/ROM contains a lot of the above documentation,    including some of the O'Reilly books (not the XView 3 Volume 7, though).

I sent them the keyboard in the mail forinspection/repair/replacement.

Well, they have had the          keyboard for over 3 weeks and I still have gotten very little infofrom them about it.

A secret algorithm can still be secure,after all, we just don't know it.  Only our level of trust isaffected, not the security of the system.The algorithm *could* be RSA for all we know, which we believe tobe secure.They have a much better reason to classify the algorithm than toprotect its security.  They want to protect its market share.If they publish the algorithm, then shortly manufacturers wouldmake chips that implement the algorithm and standard but do notuse a key stored in escrow.  And of course, everybody would buy them.The whole push of this chip is that by establishing a standard thatyou can only use if you follow their rules, they get us to followtheir rules without enacting new laws that we would fight tooth andnail.Quite simply, with Clipper established, it would be much harder foranother encryption maker to define a new standard, to make phones thatcan't talk to the leading phone companies.   The result is tappablecryptography without laws forbidding other kinds, for 99% of thepopulace.To get untappable crypto, you would have to build a special phone thatruns on top of this system, and everybody you talk to would have tohave an indentical one.That's the chicken and egg of crypto.  The government is using itsvery special ability to solve chicken and egg problems of newtechnologies to control this one in a way they like.It's almost admirably clever.  When the EFF started, I posed the question here""What are the police going to do when they wake up and discover theycan't wiretap?"" and nobody here had an answer (or even thought it wasmuch of a question)Then came the backdoor and Digital Telephony bills, which we fought.Now we have their real answer, the cleverest of all.-- Brad Templeton, ClariNet Communications Corp. -- Sunnyvale, CA 408/296-0366"	sci.crypt

I have seen a paper that quoted 10 bits per channelof 12 bits for computational precision. More than that would seem to be wasted.Perhaps the frame buffer uses another colourspace which needs more bits torepresent the full range - RGB is a cube so it is a compact encoding.Most likely however is that there are two separate 24 bit (8 bits per component)frame buffers. This set up, called double buffering, allows a complex 3d pictureto be built up on one buffer while the other buffer (containing the previousframe) is displayed. This makes for smoother animation.>(sadly, I have access to none of them.  Just a DEC 5000/25.  Sigh.)Well hey if you want to brag about numbers, the 5000 range can take a PXG Turbo+card with 96 bits per pixel. Full double buffering (Two 24 bit buffers), a 24bit Z buffer and an extra 24 bit buffer for off screen image storage.Mind you the card costs more than your workstation.--Chris Lilley----------------------------------------------------------------------------Technical Author, ITTI Computer Graphics and Visualisation Training ProjectComputer Graphics Unit, Manchester Computing Centre, Oxford Road, Manchester, UK.

From: petrack@vnet.IBM.COMSubject: Serial Line connection between Duo 210 and PC???I have tried almost everything under the sun to get a null modem connectionbetween a Mac Duo 210 and a PC. I have used MacKermit and VersaTerm onthe Mac side. I have used Procomm, Kermit, and Softerm (on OS/2) onthe PC (or PS) side. I have used non-Hardware handshaking and hardwareahdshaking cables. And know MY hands are shaking from the effort. Nothinghas allowed file transfers from the Mac to the PS.In general, I can type back and forth with no trouble, but only if both sidesare set to speeds OVER 9600 baud. I cannot send files from the Mac to thePS at all, and file transfers from the Duo to the PS are not possible.When I do a straight ascii send, I can send from the PS to the Duo flawlessly.I can send Binhex files this way quite fast, and I know that thetransmission is error free.But straight ascii sent from the Mac to the PS is full of errors.Unless, of course, I do text pacing so slow that it is like humantyping. (well, like 2-3 times faster than human typing).I would like to hear from ANYONE who has been able to transfer filesfrom a Duo 210 to a PS via modem or null modem. If you can do it, pleasetell me your EXACT combination of hardware and software. Obviously, I amtalking of a true serial port modem, not the express modem. Maybe somekind soul with access to a modem and a Duo 210 can check this out for me.Right now, I am of the opinion that it won't work at high speeds becauseof the power interrupts on the Duo, and it won't work at low speedsbecause of some crazy reason I don't understand.Could I hear from someone attesting that they can really pump informationout the serial port of a Duo 210 fast? Like via a modem or via asys-ex dump?Could anyone with a Duo help me out?? I am going absolutely INSANE.I wanna know if the problem is MY Duo, or all Duo 210s, or all Duos,or just me.Yes, I have checked the cable 1,000,000 times. And not only can I typeback and forth, but Zterm alerts the users if s/he uses hardware handshakingand CTS is down. So I know that hardware handshaking is working.

In addition, she proably should be examined by anotherdoctor who can re-evaluate the need for the medications she is taking.I can't remember the guidelines I either saw in a text or heard duringa lecture, but any elderly adult who is receiving medications should havethe need for the drug re-evaluated regularly.  If her current physicianis unwilling to do this, find one who will.  Either check the phone book for a physician who specializes in geriatric medicine or gerontology, or contact a physician referral line or the American Medical Society.By finding a geriatric specialist, he (she) will more likely be in tunewith the special needs of elderly adults and maybe can help.	sci.med

I'm just getting started with thistype of activity, so please set your flame-thowers on low.Comments, corrections, suggestions, welcomed.****************************************************************************Editor, I would like to ask you and your readers a few questions that are related tothe ""right to keep and bear arms"", and to a greater degree, the many other""rights"" that we take for granted on a daily basis. 1.	You're sleeping at night, when you hear someone in your house.  Youcall the police.  How will you defend yourself, should the need arise, whileyou are waiting for the police to arive? 2.	You are driving your family home when your car breaks down.  A ""goodsamaritan"" stops to ""help"", when you find you and your family at gun-point orknife-point.  How will you defend yourself?  And your Family? 3.	You are a woman walking alone to your car or home.  A man appearssuddenly with the intent to rape you.  How will you defend yourself?  Are youstrong enough to fight off your attacker?  Are you willing to let this man rapeyou in order to survive the attack? If the House and Senate have their way, we will soon not have the right to keepand bear arms, as provided by the Second Amendment to the Constitution. A gunmay not be the answer to each and every dangerous situation, but are you goingto let the politicians decide what sort of force or weapon you may use todefend yourself and your family? Many times a situation may be diffused by just brandishing your handgun.  Ifcertain members of the House and Senate have their way, .25, .32, and 9mmammunition will be banned for sale to anyone other than the military and lawenforcement departments.  Very soon, you may not be able to purchase ammunitionfor use in your handgun. There is already a 15 day waiting period in California.  Do you really feelthat any law abiding citizen should be required to wait this amount of time forthe purchase of a handgun when his life or family members have been threatened?Our local police do an excellent job, but they can not be there all the time,or in a moments notice.  You should have the right to protect yourself   whilewaiting for help to arrive. There is currently legislation circulating in Washington that would prohibitthe sale of certain types of ammuntion, handguns, rifles, and shot-guns.  Oneelected official even wants to repeal the Second Amendment! I want to ask the readers of this paper what they would do if their electedofficials decided that they should only belong to a ""certain church"", or go tochurch on a ""partiular day""?  What if you were told that you could only readcertain books?  Write about certain subjects?  What if you no longer had theright to a jury of your peers?  How about the right to assemble in a peacefulmanner? These are all rights that are provided by our Constitution and the Amendments.If we give up one right, we may as well give them all up.  If you do not fightfor the right to keep and bear arms, what will you fight for?  When your lifeis affected?  Write your law makers now!  Protect all of your rights bydefending your Second Amendment rights. "	talk.politics.guns

(He said he will replace the components beforeselling the car to me.)Being copmletely ignorant to the technical stuff on cars, I don't knowwhat this could mean...Is 96K km about the time typical for replacing the above mentioned items?Or is this an indication that the car was abused?Would other things break down or have to be replaced soon?The seller told me that he used the car on the highway a lot, but,I don't know how to verify this...  I've seen the paint chipped awayin tiny dots in the front edge of the hood, though.Although the Maxima is an excellent car and the car is very clean andwell kept, it's currently out of warranty(a similarly priced '90 Accord with 70K km will have 2 years or 30K kmworth of warranty left) and I don't want to worry about paying forany repair bills...But, I also need a car for 5 people...

Anyone have any ideas ??  I expect the limiting factor will be your server machine, not the networkitself. To give you a real-world example, here at Quarterdeck we haveroughly 100 people using DVX to talk to a bunch of unix boxes, novellfile servers, and each other. It's not _too_ much of a load on ourEthernet (with maybe 4 concentrators, so you have 20-30 people on eachsegment). If you had a badly loaded net, or the apps you wanted to runwere very network intensive, you could run into some slowdowns.But the biggest problem would be the machine itself. Say you have a 48633 with plenty of ram and a fast hard disk and network card. If you have10 people running programs off it, you're going to see some slowdownsbecause you're now on (effectively) a 3.3 MHz 486. Of course, DVX willattempt to see if tasks are idle and make sure they give up their timeslice, but if you have 10 working programs running, you'll know it.Having said that, if you can tweak the programs being run (by addingin calls to give up time slices when idle and that sort ofthing), you could probably run 15-20 people on a given machine beforeyou started seeing slowdowns again (this time from network bandwidth).It all really depends on what the programs are doing (ie. you're goingto see a slowdown from X-bandwidth a lot sooner if your apps are alldoing network things also...)--        Quarterdeck Office Systems - Internet Support - Tom Bortels Pricing/Ordering : info@qdeck.com  |  Tech Questions : support@qdeck.com  BBS: (310) 314-3227 * FAX: (310) 314-3217 * Compuserve: GO QUARTERDECK   Q/Fax: (310) 314-3214 from touch-tone phone for Technotes On Demand!	comp.windows.x

I don't know what typical values  are.What I'm wondering now is the following. My swap file is currently on the  IDE. I could move it to the SCSI which is 13% faster, but then I would not  be able to use 32-bit access which might actuall make it slower. So on  which drive should I put my swap file to get best results? Is there a swap  file speed test program out there?Finally, I also ran the above tests with the ASPI2DOS driver loaded and I  got no difference whatsoever in performance. Is there any reason at all  why I should load this driver?Thanks in advance, I will post a summary if I get enough responses.-Eric"	comp.os.ms-windows.misc

No, there are approximately 31,000 deaths due to guns in the U.S.,two-thirds of which are suicides.  (Unfortunately I don't have suiciderates for Norway.)  However, this makes the per-gun death rate abouthalf the per-car death rate.>The issue (I hope..):>I think we all agree that the criminals are the main problem.>Guns are not a problem, but the way they are used is....

The problem's been humans since before we had stone axes.  Thefct of the matter is simply this:  If nobody ever assaulted anybody,whether there is a weapon of any sort around would be totallyirrelevent.      Yet weapons are *built*.  I'd suggest, then, that the murderousimpulse in humanity pre-dates weapons.      Anyway, the Bosnians et al. have been making an excellent attemptto kill each other for half a thousand years.  Taking away their guns, evenif we could, would neither halt the killing nor reduce the brutality.>If 50% of ALL murders was done with axes, would you impose some regulations on them>or just say that they are ment to be used at trees, and that the axe is not a problem,>it's the 'axer' ??>(An example, don't flame me just because not exactly 50% are killed by guns...)       In the U.S., approximately 60% of murders are commited with firearms.(50% with handguns, 10% with non-handguns.)  The reason I say that guns, per se, are not the problem, is that our non-gun rate exceeds most of Europe'scountries *entire* violent crime rate.  I don't really think we've gotmore knives or fists.         In any case, I think examples of gun control *applied* to the U.S.have been abkect failures, just like drug prohibition and other formsof prohibition.  Until you deal with *why* people are doing what theyare doing, you won't solve your problem.  And if the problem is violent crime, you shouldn't concentrate on the tools instead.  The*vast* majority of guns is never, ever misused.  (On the order of99.5% over the entire lifetime of the gun).  This says to me thatyou can't make the argument that the gun itself causes the misuse.>Think about the situation in Los Angeles where people are buying guns to protect>themselves. Is this a good situation ??        The situation is not ""good"" in that people fear for their lives.But recall the scenes of the store-owners during the last riots,protecting their shops with guns.

Those>who are familiar with Directory Opus on the Amiga know what I'm>looking for.Well, a few things might help you like the 3.1 File Manager better.1) To get more than one window simply double click on a drive icon.   That it only gives you one window to work with is a fallacy. You   can drag files between windows, to any icon on the tree on the left   side of the window, and to any drive icon. This beats your ""left   and right window"" as you can have as many open as you wish instead    of just two.2) You can launch any app from within File Manager by double clicking   on the executable's icon.3) You can launch any application and open a document file by double   clicking on the document file's icon, provided you have   associations set correctly. This is easily done with the menus. The   ""browse"" capability adds a lot of functionality to 3.1. So if you   name all your text files with .txt and point all GIF, TIFF, etc.   files towards Paintshop or WinGIF, this takes care of your   requirement for ""text reading and graphics viewing"".I know someone who prefers using File Manager as his shell. Setting upall the associations you need is the way to do it.If Directory Opus is half as good as File Manager then it must bepretty good indeed!

To give you an idea:my family tree is complicated because a few of my pioneer great-great-grandfathers had several wives, and we never could figure out which wifehad each child.  One might ask why this happened.  My great-great-grandfathers were, by the time they reached their forties, quite prosperousfarmers.  Nonetheless, they lost several wives each to the rigors ofchildbirth; the graveyards in Spencer, Indiana, and Boswell, North Dakota,contain quite a few gravestones like ""Ida, wf. of Jacob Liptrap, andbaby, May 6, 1853."">You wanted>to section all women carrying breech in case one in a hundred or a>thousand breech babies get hung up in second stage,More like one in ten.

He fans on 25% of goal mouth feeds, but he still has 36 goals after a terrible start and has been an examplary (sp?) team captainthroughout a tough couple of seasons. Honorable mention: Nick Kypreos andMark Janssens. Probably more appropriate in the unsung heroes category thanMVP, but Kypreos (17 goals, 320+ PIM) has been the hardest working player onthe team and Janssens is underrated as a defensive center and checker. I guessI place a greater emphasis on hard work than skill when determining value.Biggest surprise: Geoff Sanderson. He had 13 goals and 31 points last seasonas a center, then moved to left wing and has so far put up 45 goals and 80+points. He now has a new Whaler record 21 power play goals, most all comingfrom the right wing faceoff circle, his garden spot. Honorable mention: AndrewCassels and Terry Yake. The kiddie quartet of Sanderson, Poulin, Nylander, andPetrovicky have been attracting the most attention, but Cassels is just 23and will score close to 90 points this season. He has quite nicely assumed therole of number one center on the team and works very well with Sanderson. Yakebounced around the minors for a number of seasons but is still 24 and will putup about 20 goals and 50 points this season. Yake, like Sanderson, startedperforming better offensively once he was converted from center to wing, although lefty Sanderson went to the left wing and righty Yake went to theright side.Biggest disappointment: Hands down, John Cullen. Cullen had a disasterous 77point season last year, his first full season after The Trade. Cullen startedthe season off of summer back surgery, and fell flat on his face (appropriate,since he spent all of his Whaler career flat on his ass, and whining about it).Cullen scored just 9 point on 19 games, was a clubhouse malcontent, commandedthe powerplay to a 9% success percentage (>21% with Sanderson), and sulked hisway out of town. Worst of all, his 4 year, $4M contract had three years leftto run, so no one would give up any more than the 2nd round draft pick the Maple Leafs offered to Hartford. Honorable mention: Steve Konroyd, also subparafter signing a 3 year, $2.1M contract; Eric Weinrich, who showed flashes ofcompetence, but overall has played poorly; Jim McKenzie, who was a much betterhockey player two seasons ago than he is now; and Frank Pietrangelo, who onlyseemed to play well when Sean Burke was out for an extended period and he gotto make a number of starts in a row.-SG (a real live Hartford Whalers season ticket holder)-steveg@cadkey.com	rec.sport.hockey

The Hockey USA fees cover excess medical insurance, and the club duescover ice time, officials, trophies, etc.  Other areas have similar fees, unlessthe city government subsidises some of the costs, as Stockton does.By the way; most ice arenas are located in what could be called the ""inner city""areas.

"From: Rick_Granberry@pts.mot.com (Rick Granberry)Subject: Boston C of CNote:  the following article is submitted on behalf of someone (Frank daniels) who has difficulty posting to s.r.c, email replies to daniels@math.ufl.edu	I am unable to post to the bitnet groups.	Here is a capsule history of the Shepherding/Discipleship Movement inthe Churches of Christ (i.e. Crossroads/Boston):	I could trace the Movement back as far as 1800, and indeed some of itsroots go back that far, but these were really ""influences"" on the Movement,and not the actual movement, per se.	I will start in c.1920.	In that day, there were 'white' churches and 'colored' churches innearly every area (due to segregation).  Modern Pentecostalism was developingas a predominantly 'colored' phenomenon.  Here, there was great fanaticism,emphasis on emotional experiences, and belief in a personal guidance andindwelling of the Holy Spirit.	Many 'white' Protestant churches were growing into what became knownas conservative fundamentalism.  By the 1940s, the evangelical movement wasin full swing, and many groups were becoming part of it.	When the civil rights movement grew stronger (in the 1950's and 1960's),many 'white' church groups began to be influenced by the 'black' churches andby what was going on there.  This spread started in the most liberal of groupsand spread to the more conservative ones by the late '60's.  In 1969, even theCatholic Church was displaying evidence of influence by the other groups...stillevident today.	The Churches of Christ are (and were) a very conservative Protestantgroup.  When the influence from outside began to reach the CofC in c.1965, itwas generally not appreciated.  Conservative groups are very strongly resistantto change, and the new movement was VERY different from the CofC status quo.	The magazines put out at that time by CofC folks tell the story as itunfolds.  New ideas came into the CofC.  There was a big push to reach out tocollege students, young adults, and teens.  Some called this the Campus Evangel-ism Movement.  Emotions, generally not highly regarded in the CofC at large,played a more important role in the new movement.  In some places, people beganto speak in tongues (as their Pentecostal predecessors did).	This was met with extreme criticism from within the Churches of Christ.In some places, people were fired from their jobs for speaking in tongues or foradvocating the ""Holy Spirit Movement"", another name for the new branch.  Theterm ""Underground Church of Christ"" also came into use because these people hadto hide their differences (or they might be ostricised).	There were several congregations, however, whose leaderships werereceptive to the new ideas (at least in part; the tongues-speaking never reallycaught on).  One of these was the 14th Street Church of Christ in Gainesville,FL.  Campus Ministry had already been regarded as important at 14th Street, andthe new ideas seemed to be very helpful tools for evangelism.  They also seemedto put vitality into the church, which many felt had been lacking.	In October of 1967, the 14th Street congregation hired Chuck Lucas tobe its Campus Minister.  By 1970, he would move to being the congregation's(lead) Minister.  In the late 60's/early 70's, the congregation worked with manyother groups.  They held Bible discussions at Daytona Beach during Spring Break.They organized talks in the fraternities on the University of Florida campus.They also worked with UF sports people.	In 1972, the congregation ordered a larger building to be constructed.When it was finished, the group moved and changed its name (now no longerappropriate).  It became the Crossroads Church of Christ from then on, a namethat would become legendary.	By this time, Crossroads was basically the only CofC whose programswere fully aligned to the new movement.  While they didn't start it, they continued it and were responsible for where it wound up going.	By 1975, none of the other Churches of Christ in the area felt thatthey could cooperate with Crossroads, due to what they recognized as doctrinalproblems at Crossroads.	Crossroads had begun to heavily emphasize, and later require attendanceat all church functions.  It was seen as a good thing for each member to haveat least one close relationship, a person with whom you would share all ofyour problems, pray, and get help from.  The concept was called Prayer Partners,which later became Discipleship Partners and also later became mandatory.  Theleadership was assigning prayer partners to people for a while.	The book called ""The Master Plan of Evangelism"" was a strong influenceon Chuck Lucas.  He (and the group) believed that it was every person's dutyand life purpose to carry out the great commission.  Crossroads was growingin number, and numbers became VERY important (some would say all-important).	A person who ""was evangelistic"" was ""spiritual"".  Evangelism meantinviting people to Crossroads events; if you did this a lot and some of themconverted, then you were ""spiritual"".  There were sermons about how if youbought groceries, the cashier and bag boy ought to receive invitations toservices.  Everyone at your job ought to receive invitations.  Since thesepeople needed Jesus, you should be ""aggressive""--don't take 'no' for ananswer.	If you did not evangelize enough, you came to be called ""lazy"" or""unspiritual"".	By the end of the decade, the Prayer Partner system was integrated intoa structure.  The Elders and Ministers were on top (like a big pyramid).  Thenthe group leaders, Bible study leaders, and members.  Everyone who came in hadsomeone placed over them.	It is at this time, 1978-1980, that the bad press about Crossroadsbegan to circulate.  The problem with rape on the University of Florida campuswas tremendous, but Crossroads was considered a bigger and more immediateproblem.  There were many complaints about the congregation and its ""pushy""evangelistic tactics.  Crossroads was considering the other Churches of Christto be ""dead"" churches, which aggravated them; it was aggressively recruitingout of the other church groups (denominations), which aggravated THEM.	By this time, Crossroads had grown numerically to the point (1100)where not only did they believe that they would soon need a new building, butalso they were sending out ""planting"" [create a new church] and ""reconstructing""[reorganize an existing church] teams to other cities.  By this time, theCrossroads Movement was underway.	A group was sent to the 30-member Lexington Church of Christ in Boston,MA.  The team was headed up by Kip McKean, who had been converted out of afraternity by Crossroads (in Gainesville).  Kip held a still stronger view ofchurch authority, which he believed was heavily vested in the Evangelist(s),and not so much in the Elders.  He had been fired in 1977 from the congregationthat he had been working at when the elders there found numerous things wrongwith his theology, including the practice of what came to be called one-over-oneChristianity.  [Called this by critics]	In the first year, half of the 30 people felt that they did not want tobe a part of the new congregation.  They left.  But others began coming intothe new Boston Church of Christ.	Ah, but I'm ahead of myself.	At Crossroads, the heavy-handed system had begun to take its toll onthe members.  Many have said that they felt that they were working hard, butthey were not achieving the results that were so important.  The numbers weredropping.  From 1978, Crossroads membership declined steadily.  The leadershipbegan to tighten the reigns on the congregation, who was seen as being largely""unproductive"" and ""unfruitful"".  The ""fruit"" passages in the NT were interpretedas referring to new converts.  If you were not bearing fruit, said John 15, youwould be cast into the fire!  [Boston still teaches this.]	If you love your neighbor, you'll save his soul (invite him to churchand convert him).  If you're not doing that, you don't love your neighbor.And if you don't love, you're in danger of backsliding.  The logical argumentscontinue in this vein.	In 1985, Chuck Lucas was fired from his job as minister, due to recurringsins in his life.  These struggles were never revealed to the congregation atlarge, although many people outside the congregation had heard about them.  Forby now, there was very little contact (on a friendship level) between mostCrossroads members and those outside.  [If you have contact, your focus shouldbe on converting them.  Bring them to a Bible Study.]	Chuck's replacement was Joe Woods, who was fully supportive of theBoston system.  As Boston grew in number, they began to offer 'training' sessionsfor other ministers.  Joe went to Boston to be trained and returned to Cross-roads ready to emphasize the ""total commitment"" to the church that Boston andKip McKean were now emphasizing.  Eventually, in Fall of 1987, the Elders at Crossroads (now 2 in number--Dick Whitehead and Bill Hogle) made a decision.Boston was demanding that all of the other churches in the movement come underthe direction of the church in Boston.  The Elders refused, citing their beliefthat each church should be autonomous (something true in all non-Boston Churchesof Christ).  Perhaps there was also some degree of offense done here, sinceCrossroads was no longer the 'example' to the rest of the Movement.  The groupnow numbered about 800, while Boston was now larger (in membership).	The Churches of Christ generally teach that baptism is a necessaryelement of salvation.  At Crossroads, they taught what was called 'Lordship'baptism:  you had to understand the commitment involved before you could bebaptized.  You had to 'count the cost'.  At Boston, they took this a stepfurther.  If at some time you became ""unproductive"", then your spiritualitywas suspect.  People would begin to ask you if you REALLY understood what youwere getting into.  Anyone who said 'no' had their baptism deemed invalid:  theyhadn't counted the cost properly.  They still had to be baptized.  Others calledthis ""rebaptism"", and Crossroads didn't approve of this practice.	When Crossroads announced that it would not follow Boston, many of itsmembers left Crossroads and went to Movement-related ministries, which werenow called Discipling Ministries.  You were either discipling (evangelizing) oryou were ""dead"".  They also used the nickname ""Movement of God"" for a while.	By Summer of 1988, Crossroads was withdrawn from the Movement and nowstood alone.  They had few to no allies in the mainstream Churches of Christ,and now none in the Movement.	Boston, however, continued to chart its course in the direction thatthey had been following.  They sent ""reconstruction teams"" to many cities, whichusually meant that they split the church there.  They stopped acknowledging otherchurches of Christ as Christians and began to call themselves the ""remnant"".The ""remnant"" of the Jews in the OT are those who are saved by God.  It wasfelt that the ""remnant"" today represents all the Christians.  Sometimes theywould simply call their Movement ""the church"".	They usually took the name of the city for their name, implying to theother Churches of Christ that Boston did not recognize their existence.  Manycampuses have now formally forbidden Boston ministries from recruiting theredue to the number of complaints.  In some cases, it has been documented thatBoston ministries have lied to University officials in order to continue to haveaccess to the campus.  Any resistance that they experience is termed ""perse-cution"", which all true Christians are expected to experience.  Are you reallya Christian if you're not being persecuted?	The numbers at Boston peaked at c.3000 in 1989.  Since then, they havefought to remain steady.  I have heard a tape of Kip McKean shouting at theleaders for failing to fulfill the Great Commission (their life's purpose) asGod commanded them.  Their Christianity is highly centered on commands andobedience.	Crossroads once was called a cult.  Boston is now recognized by theCult Awareness Network and other national and international groups as a cult,under a formal definition, because of the techniques which they employ.  Theterm ""cult"" is usually differentiated from ""sect"" by the practice of thosetechniques.  The techniques which they employ are recognized by many as beingtechniques of destructive pursuasion, also used by other ShepherdingDiscipleship groups.  [Robert Jay Lifton, Margaret Thaler Singer, and manyothers have written about the topic.]  These techniques include guilt motivation,emotional manipulation, loaded language, the aura of sacred science (a sortof mystic element seen in everyday events), and others.	I have no particular axe to grind against the Movement.  I have numer-ous friends who are still part of the Movement.  I have never had a 'fallingout' with anyone in the Movement.  I disagree with many things which they teach.I recognize the psychological damage done by being involved in such a system.I hold no loyalty to the mainstream Churches of Christ and do not defend theirmistakes either.	I want to point out, though, that unlike in many other systems whichare in other ways similar, the Leadership of the Boston Movement are as muchvictims of the system as the members.  We do not have a leader who enjoysmanipulating his people.  The leaders believe what they teach, and they feelaccountable for the activites (and spiritual welfare) of the members.  Whenmembers do not evangelize to their expectations, for example, the leaders feelpersonally responsible as well.  The leaders are not out for money or power.They want to evangelize the world in their lifetime.	I have said too much, but there is much more to say.  There are manyexamples I could give and quotes from other sources (including Boston bulletins)that I could include.  But this is too long already.  You may post this ifyou so desire.

Most of the people in my village are regular inhabitants that go about their dailybusiness, some work in the fields, some own small shops, others areolder men that go to the coffe shop and drink coffee.  Is that so hard toimagine ????  It is NOT a ""terrorist camp"" as you and the Israelis like to view the villages they are small communities with kids playing soccerin the streets, women preparing lunch, men playing cards, etc.....SOME young men, usually aged between 17 to 30 years are members ofthe Lebanese resistance.  Even the inhabitants of the village do not know who these are, they are secretive about it, but most people oftensuspect who they are and what they are up to.  These young men aresupported financially by Iran most of the time.  They sneak arms andammunitions into the occupied zone where they set up booby trapsfor Israeli patrols.  Every time an Israeli soldier is killed or injuredby these traps, Israel retalliates by indiscriminately bombing villagesof their own choosing often killing only innocent civilians.  Once theyare back they announce that they bombed a ""terrorist  hideout"" wherean 8 year old girl just happened to be.We are now accustomed to Israeli tactics, and we figure that this is the Israeli way of telling us that ""if you're gonna hurt our soldiersyou're gonna pay the price"".  We accept this as a price we have to payto free our land, Israel knows very well that it is not really hurtingthe resistance that much militarily with these strikes, but ratherjust keeping the pressure on the villagers to demand from their young men to stop attacking Israeli soldiers since these attacks aretaking a heavy toll on the lives of the civilian villagers.Israel's retalliation policy is cold hearted, but a reality thatwe have come to accept and deal with, the Lebanese Resistanceon the other hand is not going to stop its attacks on OCCUPYING ISRAELI SOLDIERS until they withdraw, this is the only real leverage that they have to force Israel to withdraw.The people of South Lebanon are occupied, or shelled by Israel on a regular basis.  We do not want to be occupied.  If Israel insists thatthe so called ""Security Zone"" is necessary for the protection of Northern Israel, than it will have to pay the price of its occupationwith the blood of its soldiers.  If Israel is interested in peace,than it should withdraw from OUR land.  We are not asking for the establishment of a Lebanese occupied zone in northern Israel to protectour villages that are attacked on a regular basis by Israel, so thebest policy seems to be the removal of Israeli occupation and theestablishment of peace keeping troops along the border.I have written before on this very newsgroup, that the onlyreal solution will come as a result of a comprehensive peacesettlement whereby Israel withdraws to its own borders andpeace keeping troops are stationed along the border to insureno one on either side of the border is shelled.This is the only realistic solution, it is time for Israel torealize that the concept of a ""buffer zone"" aimed at protectingits northern cities has failed.  In fact it has caused much moreIsraeli deaths than the occasional shelling of Northern Israelwould have resulted in.  If Israel really wants to save some Israeli lives it would withdraw unilaterally from the so-called ""Security Zone"" before the conclusionof the peace talks.  Such a move would save Israeli lives,advance peace efforts, give Israel a great moral lift, better Israel's public image abroad and give it an edge in the peace negociations since Israel can rightly claim that it is genuinely interested in peace and has already offered some important concessions.Along with such a withdrawal Israel could demand that Hizbollahbe disarmed by the Lebanese government and warn that it will not accept any attacks against its northern cities and that if such ashelling occurs than it will consider re-taking the buffer zoneand will hold the Lebanese and Syrian government responsible for it.There seems to be very little incentive for the Syrian and Lebanesegoovernment to allow Hizbollah to bomb Israel proper under such circumstances, and now the Lebanese government has proven that it iscapable of controlling and disarming all militias as they didin all other parts of Lebanon.  |> If you ask me those questions, I will have no problem answering (not with a |> question, as you did) : No, NOBODY is qualified candidate for murder, nothing|> justifies murder.I agree, only in the case of the Isareli soldiers their killingCANNOT be qualified as murder, no matter what you say.

For AT class and later machines, IRQ5 isreserved for LPT2.  Since it's rare to have a second parallelport in a PC, it's usually a good safe choice if you need aninterrupt.On the other hand, we just ran into a problem with that hereat work on a Gateway computer (4DX-33V).  It has a Modem on COM1,a Mouse on COM2, and the other serial port was set to COM3 (whichnormally uses the same interrupt as COM1).  We had a real fightwith a board when trying to use IRQ5, and discoverd the problemwas that Gateway had set it up such that COM3 used IRQ5.  As soonas we disabled COM3, our problems went away.

To make things compatable,>I removed my Permanent swap file before starting the upgrade.  However, when all the dust settled, and I go into windows, it says that the temporary swap file is right where it always was, in the Windows directory.  My question is:  How come the temporary swap files works OK with a compressed drive, and the permanent one doesn't?you might want to look in windows FAQ for this one, but here is my bestexplanation.  But I can't guarantee that I'm not way off base...The permenant swap file is read/written to by windows by talkingdirectly to the hard disk controller card.  The controller card mustuse the protocal set up by western digital (or something like that).Windows creates a file called spart.par in your windows directory thatpoints to that file.  It then uses the physical information about yourdisk to index to information in that file.compressed disks are actually ""logical"" disks.  These disks have differentcharacteristics than the actual physical disk.  Furthermore, the informationon the compressed disks must be uncompressed before it is used.  (i.e it mustgo through the decompression program that traps disk reads at the operatingsystem level or the BIOS level).  Because of this ""inbetween"" program, windowscannot use direct methods to read from the ""logical"" disk.a permenant swap file is only there to ""reserve"" an area of the disk thatwindows can use and to block that space from DOS.  Windows would theoreticallynot even have to access the file from DOS to use that disk space. (I don'tknow if it does or doesn't...but it checks for it somewhere everytime youboot windows.)a temporary swap file is just a normal DOS file that is accessed by windowsvia DOS and the BIOS.  If a disk compression program or other TSR is loadedthe file access must go through DOS...TSR'S (disk compression)...and BIOS inorder to be access. (i.e. NEVER USE A TEMPORARY SWAP FILE...NEVER)more on permenent swap files...i'm sure everyone who has an uncompressed part of their compressed hard diskhas seen the message ""you have selected a swap file greater than the suggestedsize...windows will only use the size suggested...do you wan't to create thisswap file anyway"" or something like that.well, a friend of mine (ROBERT) called microsoft and asked them what and why.what they said is that windows checks the amount of free disk space anddivides that number by 2.  Then it checks for the largest contiguous blockof free disk space.  Windows then suggests the smaller of the two numbers.They also said that under absolutely no circumstances...NONE!...will windowsuses a swap file larger than the suggested size.  Well...that's what he said!I call bull@#$#.

"From: daveb@pogo.wv.tek.com (Dave Butler)Subject: Objectivity (was: After 2000 years...)This discussion on ""objective"" seems to be falling into solipsism (Eg: therecent challenge from Frank Dwyer, for someone to prove that he can actuallyobserve phenomena).  Someones even made the statement that science is""subjective"" and that even atom are ""subjective."" This is getting a bit sillyand the word ""objective"" is losing all meaning.  Lets start by remembering thedefinition of ""objective"" which has been already presented:  objective ADJ. 1. Of or having to do with a material object as     distinguished from a mental concept. 2. Having actual existence.    3.a. Unenfluenced by emotion or personal prejudice. b. Based on    observable phenomenon.The Objectivity of a thing is not based on whether everyone agrees on thatthing (eg: the world is objectively round, regardless of the fact that thereexist flat earthers), but rather whether it is based observable and verifiablephenomenon (instead of being based solely on peoples wishes, feeling, mentalprocesses, etc).  Thus atoms, being based on very observable and repeatablephenomenon, are indeed considered to be objective rather than subjective. Even weird, high energy physics is based on observable phenomenon (even thoughthat observation can change the outcome).  Nor are those observable phenomenonaffected by emotion, or personal prejudice (eg: chemical reactions do notchange to the whims of different people).  Thus to say that science is notobjective (ie: objectively verifiable) is a bit silly, as that is thepoint of science.  Now I will agree that science is not objectively ""good;"" Iwill not thereby conclude though that science is not objective. Now some examples things which are ""objective"":  A D-12 tractor is largerthan the average breadbox.  Chlorophyll is green.  Seawater contains salt.There exists ozone in the atmosphere (at least presently).  Ozone blocks ultraviolet light.  Ultraviolet light increases the incidents of skin Cancer.""Good"" on the other hand is a value judgement.  It doesn't seem to have anexistence apart from what we give it (unless someone can objectively show theexistence of an omnipotent entity which has defined ""good"").  We cannotquantify it, touch it or collect it in any concrete sense (eg: I have a bagfull of ""good"").  Now we do sometimes attempt to give the word ""good"" anobjective meaning, e.g.  ""good"" has been used to denote strength, resiliency,speed, etc.  That though, is a subjective definition, as some might not see""strength"" and etc, as necessarily ""good"" (eg: strength inspired by Naziism is not generally viewed as ""good""). As to a morality, I cannot say that I have ever seen a morality strictly basedon verifiable observable phenomenon.  The closest I have seen is some form ofthe ""Golden Rule,"" which concludes that it is best not to deliberately pisspeople off, as they will likely then involve themselves in your life, in amanner you won't like.  This is verifiable; when you ""get in someone's face,""they will often retaliate.  Another objective fact about morality is that amore powerful group can enforce their morality on a weaker group, and thus canat times, ignore that form of the ""Golden Rule"" without fear of reprisal.  Nowas to whether this enforcing of morality is ""good"" or ""bad,"" is quitesubjective.  By the way, remember that subjective does not mean that a thingcannot be formally stated, or even commonly agreed upon; it only means thatthat it is not verifiable from observable phenomena, or has a physicalexistence unto itself.  Also note that I have not stated that there is no suchthing as an objective morality, or that I could not accept any such amorality; I have simply stated that I have seen no evidence of any suchmorality. One other thing to notice, ""objective"" is many times used as synonymous with""true"" and/or ""absolute,"" and ""subjective"" sometimes has the connotation of""false"" and/or ""relative."" Tain't necessarily so.  For instance, when aconclusion is based on objective, but insufficient evidence, then it can beboth objective and false.  As to ""absolute,"" it is easy to note that while wecan objectively show that TNT is explosive, but that does not absolutely meanthat all TNT will explode, and thus objective is not necessarily absoluteeither.  On the other hand, something subjective can also be either""absolutist,"" or ""true."" For instance, there are some theists who arespecifically ""absolutist"" in their morality, even though they have onlysubjective evidence to back it up.  Further, many a scientist and detectivehas been motivated by subjective reasons (eg: a ""gut feeling"" or ""hunch""), toinvestigate a phenomena or situation, and gather the objective evidencenecessary to support a true hypothesis.  On the whole though, I would have toagree that objective evidence is much more trustworthy than subjectiveevidence.

But we knowenough about the physics of the situation to do some calculations.There are in fact three effects contributing to leaning the bike overto begin a turn.	1. Gyro effect causing a torque which twists the bike over.	2. Contact patch having shifted to one side, causing bike to fall over.	3. Contact patch being accelerated to the side, causing a	torque which twists the bike over.Take an average bike/rider, average bike wheel, and at speeds of 5,15, and 50 mph (say) calculate how much twist of the bars would beneeded to produce (say) 20 degrees of lean in (say) 2 seconds by eacheffect alone. My guess is that at slow speeds 2 is dominant, and athigh speeds 3 is dominant, and at all speeds 1 contributes not far offbugger all, relatively speaking.By the way, a similar problem is this: how does a runner who wants torun round a corner get leaned into the corner fast?

V.42bis, of course, iscurrently only *STANDARDIZED* for operation on top of V.42 (in its primarymode of operation, LAPM), but that's about as far as that goes.and just in case there's some confusion on this, V.42/V.42bis are alsosupported by the Courier line (unless you have a really ancient one).>The difference>with the Courier, is that it can run at 16.8 and only in the HST mode. take a second look at the original question:>In a previous article, cs3sd3ae@maccs.mcmaster.ca (Holly       KS) says:>>What is the difference between the US Robotics Courier v32bis external                                                 ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^see the V.32bis up there?  the question was not about the Courier HSTmodem, or about the Courier Dual Standard...it was about the CourierV.32bis modem.  the modem in question does not support HST, period.  ittherefore does not support the 16.8 kb HST.also, not all Courier HST / Courier Dual Standard modems support the 16.8 kbversion of HST.  my Dual Standard only supports HST at 14.4 kb.  there areeven older models that only run HST at 9.6 kb.>This is a proprietary mode of USR and it will only connect to another of>the same type unit to achieve this speed.HST is USR's proprietary modulation scheme....  but we're not talking aboutHST, we're talking about V.32bis.

HST operates at [9.6 / 14.4 / 16.8] in one direction,and has a low-speed back-channel in the other direction.  the high-speedchannel goes in the direction of the higher data flow.  this is fine ifyou're logged on to say, a BBS, and type one letter and get screens ofinfo back, transfer files (not using bimodem), etc....  there is, of course,a penalty for turnaround time when the high-speed channel needs to reversedirections.V.32 and V.32bis are both symmetrical, meaning they do transfer the fulldata rate in both directions at the same time.third, synchronous vs asynchronous has absolutely nothing to do withsymmetrical vs asymmetrical...they are two completely different topics.>The HST's will be upgradeable to the v.fast spec when it is available.again, more correctly put, *SOME* of the Courier line will be upgradeableto whatever ``V.fast'' is called when it's complete.  if you have the largefootprint Courier modems (like I do), you're S.O.L.....  there was anupgrade plan a while back to upgrade to a small footprint variety, whichcould eventually be upgraded to support V.fast, but the cost of the twoupgrades together pretty much put it higher than just buying a new modem.later.....   --jim--#include <std_disclaimer.h>                                 73 DE N5IAL (/4)------------------------------------------------------------------------------INTERNET: jim@n5ial.mythical.com  |  j.graham@ieee.org     ICBM: 30.23N 86.32WAMATEUR RADIO: n5ial@w4zbb (Ft.

"From: JEK@cu.nih.govSubject: etymology of ""Easter""for SRCIn most languages, the Feast of the Resurrection of Our Lord isknown as the PASCH, or PASQUE, or some variation thereof, a wordwhich comes from the Hebrew PESACH, meaning ""Passover."" In English,German, and a few related languages, however, it is known as EASTER,or some variation thereof, and questions have been asked about theorigin of this term.One explanation is that given by the Venerable Bede in his DERATIONE TEMPORUM 1:5, where he derives the word from the name of anAnglo-Saxon goddess of Spring called EASTRE. Bede is a greatscholar, and it is natural to take his word for it. But he lived673-735, and Augustine began preaching in Kent in 597. The use ofthe word EASTER to describe the Feast would have been wellestablished before the birth of Bede and probably before the birthof anyone he might have discussed the subject with. It seems likelythat his derivation is just a guess, based on his awareness thatthere had been an Anglo-Saxon goddess of Spring bearing that name,and the resemblance of the words. Thus, if the said resemblance(surely it is not surprising that a personification of Spring shouldhave a name similar to the word for Dawn) is not in istelfconvincing, the testimony (or rather the conjecture) by Bede doesnot make it more so.Assuming that Bede was right, that would not justify saying that theChristian celebration (which, after all, had been going on for somecenturies before the name EASTER was applied to it) has pagan roots.It would simply mean that the Anglo-Saxons, upon becoming Christiansand beginning to celebrate the Resurrection by a festival everyspring, called it by the name that to them meant simply ""SpringFestival.""However, Bede's is not the only theory that has been proposed.  JKnoblech, in ""Die Sprach,"" ZEITSCHRIFT FUER SPRACHWISSENSCHAFT 5(Vienna, 1959) 27-45, offers the following derivation:Among Latin-speaking Christians, the week beginning with the Feastof the Resurrection was known as ""hebdomada alba"" (white week),since the newly-baptized Christians were accustomed to wear theirwhite baptismal robes throughout that week. Sometimes the week wasreferred to simply as ""albae."" Translaters rendering this intoGerman mistook it for the plural of ""alba,"" meaning ""dawn."" Theyaccordingly rendered it as EOSTARUM, which is Old High German for""dawn."" This gave rise to the form EASTER in English.

I've heard it said that the accounts we have of Christs life andministry in the Gospels were actually written many years after the event.(About 40 years or so). Is this correct?? If so, why the big time delay??I know all scripture is inspired of God, so the time of writing is I supposeun-important, but I still can't help be curious!---------------------------------------------------Ivan Thomas Barr Contact me at u9126619@athmail1.causeway.qub.ac.uk[The Gospels aren't dated, so we can only guess.  Luke's prolog isabout the only thing we have from the author describing his process.The prolog sounds like Luke is from the next generation, and had to dosome investigating.  There are traditions passed down verbally thatsay a few things about the composition of the Gospels.  There aredebates about how reliable these traditions are.  They certainly don'thave the status of Scripture, yet scholars tend to take some of themseriously.  One suggests that Mark was based on Peter's sermons, andwas written to preserve them when Peter had died or way about to die.One tradition about Matthew suggests that a collection of Jesus wordsmay have been made earlier than the current Gospels.  In the ancient world, it was much more common to rely on verbaltransmission of information.  I think many people would have preferredto hear about Jesus directly from someone who had known him, and maybeeven from someone who studied directly under such a person, ratherthan from a book.  Thus I suspect that the Gospels are largely from aperiod when these people were beginning to die.  Scholars generally dothink there was some written material earlier, which was probably usedas sources for the existing Gospels.Establishing the dates is a complex and technical business.  I have toconfess that I'm not sure how much reliance I'd put on the methodsused.  But it's common to think that Mark was written first, around 64AD., and that all of the Gospels were written by the end of theCentury.  A few people vary this by a decade or so one way or theother.--clh]"	soc.religion.christian

From: mmm@cup.portal.com (Mark Robert Thorson)Subject: Re: Barbecued foods and health riskThis reminds me of the last Graham Kerr cooking show I saw.  Today hesmoked meat on the stovetop in a big pot!  He used a strange techniqueI'd never seen before.He took a big pot with lid, and placed a tray in it made from aluminum foil.The tray was about the size and shape of a typical coffee-table ash tray,made by crumpling a sheet of foil around the edges.In the tray, he placed a couple spoonfuls of brown sugar, a similarquantity of brown rice (he said any rice will do), the contents of twoteabags of Earl Grey tea, and a few cloves.On top of this was placed an ordinary aluminum basket-type steamer, withtwo chicken breasts in it.  The lid was put on, and the whole assemblywent on the stovetop at high heat for 10 or 12 minutes.Later, he removed what looked like smoked chicken breasts.  What surprisesand concerns me are:1)  No wood chips.  Where does the smoke flavor come from?2)  About 5 or 10 years ago, I remember hearing that carmel color    (obtained by caramelizing sugar -- a common coloring and flavoring    agent) had been found to be carcinogenic.  I believe they injected    it under the skin of rats, or something.  If the results were conclusive,    caramel color would not be legal in the U.S., yet it is still being    used.  Was the initial research result found to be incorrect, or what?3)  About 5 or 10 years ago, I remember Earl Grey tea being implicated    as carcinogenic, because it contains oil of bergamot (an extract    from the skin of a type of citrus fruit).  Does anyone know whatever    happened with that story?  If it were carcinogenic, Earl Grey tea    could not have it as an additive, yet it apparently continues to do    so.WRT natural wood smoke (I've smoking a duck right now, as it happens),I've noticed that a heavily-smoked food item will have an unpleasant tangytaste when eaten directly out of the smoker if the smoke has only recentlystopped flowing.  I find the best taste to be had by using dry wood chips,getting lots of smoke right up at the beginning of the cooking process,then slowly barbequing for hours and hours without adding additional wood chips.My theory is that the unpleasant tangy molecules are low-molecular weightstuff, like terpenes, and that the smoky flavor molecules are some sortof larger molecule more similar to tar.  The long barbeque time afterthe initial intensive smoke drives off the low-molecular weight stuff,just leaving the flavor behind.  Does anyone know if my theory is correct?I also remember hearing that the combustion products of fat drippingon the charcoal and burning are carcinogenic.  For that reason, and becauseit covers the product with soot and some unpleasant tanginess, I only grillnon-drippy meats like prawns directly over hot coals.  I do stuff like thisduck by indirect heat.  I have a long rectangular Weber, and I put the coalsat one end and the meat at the other end.  The fat drops directly on thefloor below the meat, and next time I use the barbeque I make the firein that end to burn off the fat and help ignite the coals.And yet another reason I've heard not to smoke or barbeque meat is thatsmoked cured meat, like pork sausage and bacon, containsnitrosamines, which are carcinogenic.  I'm pretty sure this claim actuallyhas some standing, don't know about the others.An amusing incident I recall was the Duncan Hines scandal, when it wasdiscovered that the people who make Duncan Hines cake mix were puttinga lot of ethylene dibromide (EDB) into the cake mix to suppress weevils.This is a fumigant which is known to be carcinogenic.The guy who represented the company in the press conference defendedhimself by saying that the risk from eating Duncan Hines products every dayfor a year would be equal to the cancer risk from eating two charcoal-broiled steaks.  What a great analogy!  When I first heard that, myimmediate reaction was we should make that a standard unit!  One charcoalbroiled steak would be equivalent to 0.5 Duncans!	sci.med

"From: dbm0000@tm0006.lerc.nasa.gov (David B. Mckissock)Subject: NASA ""Wraps""In the April edition of ""One Small Step for a Space Activist"",Allen Sherzer & Tim Kyger write:  ""Another problem is what are called 'wraps' (or sometimes   the 'center tax'). When work for a large program like   Freedom or Shuttle is performed at a NASA center, the   center skims off a portion which goes into what amounts   to a slush fund. This money is used to fund work the   center manager wants to fund. This sum is estimated to   be over a third of the funds allocated. Think about   that: Of the $30 billion cost of Freedom, fully $10   billion won't be spent on anything having anything   to do with Space Stations! Now, maybe that $10 billion   was wisely spent (and maybe it wasn't), but the work done   with it should stand on its own merits, not distorting   the cost of other projects. Congress has no idea of the   existense of these wraps; Congress has never heard the   term 'center tax'. They look at the Station they are   getting and the price they are paying and note that   it doesn't add up. They wonder this blissfully unaware   that a third of the money is going for something else.""My dear friends, your mixing fact and fiction here. A coupleof weeks ago, when I first read this in your posting, Italked with one of the cost experts here in Space Stationat Headquarters [if you wondering why I didn't post aresponse immediately, I do have a real job I'm supposedto be doing here at Headquarters, & digging up old 20 kHzdata & looking into Sherzer/Kyger claims rates pretty lowon the totem pole of priority. Also, I spent last weekendin Kansas City, at the National Science Teachers Association conference, extolling the virtues of SSFto 15,000 science teachers.]First off, yes, the concept of 'center tax', or 'wrap' doesexist. If I recall the numbers correctly, the total 'tax'for the SSF program for this fiscal year is around $40 Million.This was computed by adding up the WP-1, WP-2, and WP-4center 'taxes'. With the SSF budget for this fiscal year at$2.2 Billion, my calculater says the tax percentage is04/2.2 = 1.8%Over the life of the SSF program, using your figure of $30billion for the cost of SSF, a tax at a 1.8% rate comes to$540 million. This is alot less than $10 billion, but Iwill concede it's still an appreciable amount of pocketchange.I should note that your estimate of the tax rate at 1/3 couldbe close to the actual rate. The tax is only charged on fundsthat are spent at the center (kind of like McDonalds at somestates, where you do have to pay sales tax if you eatthe food at the restaurant, but you don't if you get ittake-out). For example, at WP-4, the vast bulk of the fundswe receive go to the Rocketdyne Contract, and are *NOT*subject to the center tax (I don't have the numbers infront of me, but I'd guess at least 95% of the WP-4 fundsgo to Rocketdyne). So, you could be right about a taxrate of 1/3, but it's only applied to funds spent at thecenter, and not to the prime contracts.This leads to the obvious question ""What is the governmentdoing with SSF funds that don't go to the prime contractors?(i.e. ok, WP-4 gets a slice of the $30 billion pie. Abig portion of this slice goes to Rocketdyne. What happensto the balance of the funds, which aren't eatenup by the center tax?)""At WP-4, we call these funds we spend in-house supportingdevelopment funds (as they are supporting the developmentwork done by Rocketdyne). We have used these funds tosetup our own testbed, to checkout the electricalpower system architecture. Our testbed has a real lifesolar array field (left over from solar cell researchresearch a few years back), with lead-acid car batteries(to simulate the Nickel-Hydrogen batteries on SSF), DCswitchgear, DC-DC converter units, and simulatedloads. Data from the testbed was used in a recentchange evaluation involving concerns about the stabilityof the power system.We have also used the supporting development money topurchase Nickel Hydrogen batteries, which are on lifetesting at both Lewis and the Crane Naval facility inIndiana. As a side point, 6 of the battery cells ontest recently hit the four year life test milestone.38 cells have completed 18,552 to 23,405 cycles (theon-orbit batteries go through 5,840 cycles per year).As a final example, my 'home' division at Lewis usedthe supporting development funds to purchase personalcomputers and work stations, for performing systemanalyses (like modeling of the performance of theelectrical power system, availability calculationsusing a Monte-Carlo simulation, setting up a database with information on weight of the powersystem elements).Finally, the money raised by the 'tax' does not allgo into a 'slush fund.' At Lewis, the directordoes control a small discretionary fund. Each year,any individual at Lewis can submit a proposal tothe director to get money from this fund to lookat pretty much anything within the Lewis Charter.Most of the tax, however, goes to fund the 'general'services at the Center, like the library, the central computer services division, the Contractor who removes the snow, etc. Thus, it is ratherdifficult to determine what percentage of theSSF budget doesn't go for SSF activities. To getan accurate figure, you would have to takethe annual expenditure for the library (for example),and then divide by the amount of the library fundsused to support SSF (which would be hard tocompute by itself - how would you figure outwhat percentage of the bill for Aviation Week for1 year is 'billable' to SSF, would you base it onthe person-hours SSF employees spend reading AV-weekversus the rest of the center personnel). You wouldthen have to compare this estimate of the SSFportion of the library expense with the portion ofthe tax that goes to support the library. Who knows,maybe SSF overpays on the tax to run the library, butwe underpay for snow removal? Talk abouta burecratic nightmare!My last point is that I can't believe your claim thatCongress has never heard of the term 'center tax.'Unfortunately, all of the NASA testimony beforeCongress isn't on a computer, so I can't do a simpleword search someplace to prove you wrong. But surely,in some GAO audit somewhere, these NASA cost methodswere documented for Congress?"	sci.space

This is primarily a Catholic doctrine, with noother purpose than to defend the idea of infant baptism.  Even among, itssupporters, however, people will stop short of saying that unbaptised infantswill go to hell.It's very easy for just about anyone to come up with a partial list ofscripture to support any sort of wrong doctrine.  However, if we have theheart to persevere in our beliefs to make sure that they are biblicallybased, then we can come to an understanding of the truth.  Let's now take amore complete look at scripture.Colossians 2:11-12 ""In him you were also circumcised, in the putting off ofthe sinful nature, not with a circumcision done by Christ, having beenburied with him in baptism and raised with him through your faith in thepower of God, who raised him from the dead.""In baptism, we are raised to a new life in Christ (Romans 6:4) through apersonal faith in the power of God.  Our parent's faith cannot do this.  Doinfants have faith?  Let's look at what the Bible has to say about it.Romans 10:16-17 ""But not all the Israelites accepted the good news.  ForIsaiah says, 'Lord, who has believed our message?'  Consequently, faithcomes from hearing the message, and the message is heard through the wordof Christ.""So then we receive God's gift of faith to us as we hear the message of thegospel.  Faith is a possible response to hearing God's word preached.  Kidsare not yet spiritually, intellectually, or emotionally mature enough torespond to God's word.  Hence they cannot have faith and therefore cannotbe raised in baptism to a new life.Ezekiel 18:20 ""The soul who sins will die.  The son will not share theguilt of the father, nor will the father share the guilt of the son.  Therighteousness of the righteous man will be credited to him, and thewickedness of the wicked will be charged against him.""If you read all of Ezekiel 18, you will see that God doesn't hold us guiltyfor anyone else's sins.  So we can have no original guilt from Adam.Ezekiel 18:31-32 ""Rid yourselves of all the offenses you have committted,and get a new heart and a new spirit.  Why will you die, O house of Israel?For I take no pleasure in the death of anyone, declares the Sovereign Lord.Repent and live!""The way to please God is to repent and get a new heart and spirit.  Kidscannot do this.  Acts 2:38-39 says that when we repent and are baptized, wewill then receive a new spirit, the Holy Spirit.  Then we shall live.Now then that we have a little more background as to why original sin isnot Biblical, let's look at some of the scriptures used to support it.Romans 5:12 ""Therefore, just as sin entered the world through one man, anddeath through sin, and in this way death came to all men, because allsinned--""Sin and death entered the world when the first man sinned.  Death came toeach man because each man sinned.  Note that it's good to read through allof Romans 5:12-21.  Some of the verses are easier to misunderstand thanothers, but if we read them in context we will see that they are allsaying basically the same thing.  Let's look at one such.Romans 5:19 ""For just as through the disobedience of the one man the manywere made sinners, so also through the obedience of the one man the manywill be made righteous.""Through the disobedience of each individual, each was made a sinner.  Inthe same way, through the obedience of Jesus, each will be made righteous.We must remember when reading through this passage that death came to eachman only because each man sinned, not because of guilt from Adam.Otherwise the Bible would contradict itself.  I encourage you to readthrough this whole passage on your own, looking at it from this point ofview to see if it doesn't all fit together.Psalm 51:5 ""Surely I was sinful at birth, sinful from the time my motherconceived me.""This whole Psalm is a wonderful example of how we should humble ourselvesbefore God in repentance for sinning.  David himself was a man after God'sown heart and wrote the Psalm after committing adultry with Bathsheba andmurdering her husband.  All that David is saying here is that he can'tremember a time when he wasn't sinful.  He is humbling himself before Godby confessing his sinfulness.  His saying that he was sinful at birth isa hyperbole.  The Bible, being inspired by God, isn't limited to a literalinterpetation, but also uses figures of speech as did Jesus (John 16:25).For another example of hyperbole, see Luke 14:26.Now then, even though people see that baptism requires faith and thatoriginal sin is not Biblical, they will still argue that infant baptism isnecessary because children sin by being selfish - not sharing toys withother children, by being mean - hitting others and fighting, etc.Certainly we have observed children doing wrong things, but my gut feelingis always that they don't know any better.  Let's look to see if the Bibleagrees with my gut feelings.Isaiah 7:14-15 ""Therefore the Lord himself will give you a sign:  Thevirgin will be with child and will give birth to a son, and will call himImmanuel.  He will eat curds and honey when he knows enough to reject thewrong and choose the right.""Now just about any church leader will tell you that this is a prophecyabout Jesus.  If they don't, then point them to Matthew 1:23 and find a newleader.  Jesus certainly couldn't have had less knowledge than normal humanbabies.  Yet this passage says that he had to mature to a certain extentbefore he would know the difference between right and wrong.  We see thathe did grow and become wiser in Luke 2:40 and 2:52.  The implication isthat Jesus did wrong things as a child before he knew to choose right overwrong.  Since we know that Jesus was perfect -- without sin, we have ratherconclusive proof that babies cannot sin because they don't know to choosethe right instead of the wrong.Jesus himself was baptized, albeit with John's baptism, not as an infant,but as a thirty-year-old man (Luke 3:21-23) and started his ministry assoon as he was baptized (Luke 3:23).  Immediately afterwards, he wastempted by the devil (Luke 4:1-13; Matthew 4:1-11; Mark 1:12-13).Thank you for your attention.Moderator - this should finish up the subject for a while.  Perhaps youwould like to make a FAQ out of this response so that you can repost itfrom time to time when the topic comes up.  Feel free to rearrange thecontents if you would like to, but please send me a copy of the final FAQ.Sincerely,Aaron Cardenasaaronc@athena.mit.edu[I think you're overly optimistic about the authoritative quality ofyour response.  First, original sin is not a Catholic-only doctrine.It was held by Luther and Calvin as well, and is still present in oneform or another in the Lutheran and Reformed traditions.  Second,saying that it has no other purpose than defending infant baptism isan ad hominem argument, which has considerable evidence against it.The original Baptist theology included original sin, and some Baptistsstill hold it.  And there are certainly groups that baptize infantswithout believing in original sin.  Among Protestants, the sacramentstend to be a bit more symbolic than among Catholics.  Protestants whobaptize infants see baptism as a sign of God's acceptance of us,rather than our acceptance of God.  In traditional Protestanttheology, God's grace precedes our response, and is applicable tochildren.  There are a number of passages one can cite to indicatethat God accepts even children.  --clh]"	soc.religion.christian

EDT	     	     	     Q	  For everyone listening on KDKA Radio, I'm Mike Whitely, KDKA Radio News.  We're here at the Pittsburgh International Airport and with me is the President of the United States Bill Clinton.	     	     And I'd like to welcome you to the area and to KDKA.	     	     THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you, Mike.  Glad to be here.	     	     Q	  There are a lot of things we'd like to talk about in the brief amount of time we have, but some news is just breaking from Los Angeles.  I guess the entire country has been kind of holding their breath, wondering what's going to happen in the trial of the four Los Angeles police officers.  We just heard that two of those officers, the sergeant, Sergeant Koon and Officer Powell have been found guilty, and two officers have been found not guilty.	     	     It's a situation that's been building for over a year since the first trial and now this trial and this verdict.  And I wonder what your thoughts are this morning on how you see the situation in Los Angeles in connection with your administration and what you're trying to do.	     	     THE PRESIDENT:  Well, first of all, I think the American people should know that this trial, in my judgment, is a tribute to the work and judgment of the jury, as well as to the efforts of the federal government in developing the case.	     	     The law under which the officers were tried is a complex one; the standards of proof are complicated.  The jury decided that they would convict the sergeant who was responsible for supervising the officers and the officer who on the film did most of the beating.  The jury acquitted an officer who kicked Rodney King, but also plainly tried to shield him from some blows, and another officer who was a rookie.	     	     No one knows exactly why they did what they did, but it appears that they really tried to do justice here.  They acknowledged that his civil rights were violated.  And I think that the American people should take a lot of pride in that.  But I hope now we can begin to look ahead and focus on three things:  first of all, the importance of trying to bring this country together and not violate the civil rights of any American; secondly, the importance of renewing our fight against crime.  	     	     I think it's important to recognize that in the poorest areas of Los Angeles and many other cities in this country, people may be worried about police abuse, but they're even more worried about crime.  It's time that we renewed our efforts to go to community policing -- put 100,000 more police officers on the street; pass the Brady Bill that would require a waiting period before people could buy a handgun, and do some other things to reduce the vulnerability of our people to violence and drugs.	     	     And the last point I'd like to make is it seems to me that we have got to rededicate ourselves to the economic revitalization of our cities and other economically-distressed areas.  If you just think about it -- if everybody in Los Angeles who wanted a job had one, I don't think we'd have quite as many problems as we do.  	     	     And I laid out a very ambitious program in the campaign to try to bring private investment and public investment to bear in our cities.  I have dispatched the Commerce Secretary, Ron Brown, to California to try to come up with some strategies for that state, because it's our biggest state with our highest unemployment rate -- which could then be applied around the country.  I want to talk to him and to the Attorney General, to the new head of the NAACP, to Reverend Jackson, and to several other people, and then I'll decide where to go from here with regard to Los Angeles and the other cities of the country.	     	     Q	  Let's talk about what brings you to the Pittsburgh area today.  There have been -- I guess there's been a lot of discussion on Capitol Hill about your stimulus package.  You've been locked in a battle with the GOP.  Yesterday, as you said earlier in your radio address, you made some moves to break that gridlock.  What brings you to Pittsburgh, in particular to Allegheny County, in particular to Pennsylvania, with that battle?	     	     THE PRESIDENT:  Well, there are two reasons.  First of all, Pittsburgh, Allegheny County and Pennsylvania supported me in the last election because they wanted a new direction in economic policy.  We have passed our overall economic plan; it gives the country a very different budget for the next five years than we've had in the previous 12.  We reduced the deficit and, at the same time, increased investment in jobs and education and health care, in the things that will make us a stronger country.	     	     But in addition to that, I asked the Congress in the short run to spend a little more money, a modest amount of money to create another half-million jobs in the next year and a half; to try to cut the unemployment rate by a half a percent; but also to try to spark job creation in the private sector more.  The plan passed the House.  It has the support of a majority of the Senate.  At the present time, all the Republican   senators as a bloc are filibustering the bill.  That is, they won't let it come to a vote.	     	     I believe that Senator Specter would like to vote for the bill.  And I believe that Senator Dole, the Republican leader, has put a lot of pressure on a lot of the Republicans to stay hitched.  And they're all saying that this bill increases the deficit.  It doesn't.  This bill is well below the spending targets that Congress approved, including the Republicans, for this year.  This bill is paid for by budget cuts in the next five years.  This bill is designed to give a jump-start to the economy.  And I must say, a lot of the Republican senators that are holding it up, when Mr. Bush was President, voted for billions of dollars of emergency spending of just this kind --much of it was totally unrelated to creating jobs.	     	     So what I'm trying to do is to break this logjam.  I've held out an olive branch, I've offered a compromise.  But I think that we ought to try to put some more Americans to work right now to show that we're changing the direction of the country.  And that's the purpose of the bill.	     	     Q	  Have you been in touch with Senator Specter or his office lately?	     	     THE PRESIDENT:  Well, we've been trying to talk regularly to -- through my White House Congressional Liaison operation to the senators that we think are open to this --Senator Specter, Senator D'Amato from New York, Senator Jeffords from Vermont, Senator Hatfield from Oregon, and five or six others whom we believe know we need more jobs in this economy and know that we are paying for this with budget cuts over the life of the budget I presented.	     	     You know, it has a lot of appeal to say, well, we've got a big deficit, we shouldn't increase it more.  But the truth is that we are paying for this with budget cuts in the whole life of the budget over the next few years.  And more importantly, we have this program well below the spending targets that Congress has already approved for this year.  And they've done this for years, with the Republicans voting for it -- many Republicans voting for it -- for things that weren't nearly as important as putting the American people back to work.  	     	     So I just hope that this doesn't become a political issue.  It ought to just be about the people of this country and the need for jobs.	     	     Q	  I have some questions from people who supported you, and some people who are skeptical about your administration.  It has to do with their hopes, and also with their fears.  A lot of people who supported you and voted for you in Pennsylvania --I think some of them are now saying, we're glad we got him in the White House, but now look at this incredible process he has to go through.  Look at these problems.  Look at this gridlock.  And they're beginning to wonder, is this going to work; can you pull it off?  And, of course, your skeptics are saying, well, I knew it was going to be like this.	     	     THE PRESIDENT:  Well, what I would -- I'd ask people, first of all, to remember that we are, frankly, moving very fast.  The budget resolution that the Congress passed is the fastest they have ever passed a budget resolution -- ever -- in history, setting out the next five-year budget targets.  So we are moving really rapidly.  And we've got them working on political reform, welfare reform, health care reform, a whole wide range of things.  	     	     But it's a big operation.  You can't expect to turn it around overnight.  It took 12 years to produce the conditions which led to the victory I received from the people in November, and we can't turn it around in 90 days.  But I think we're making real, real progress.  	     	     I would urge the people not to get discouraged.  We're not going to win every battle, and not everything is going to happen overnight.  But we are definitely moving and changing things.	     	     Q	  Thank you very much.  	     	     The President of the United States, Bill Clinton, here live at Pittsburgh International Airport.  I'm Mike Whitely, KDKA News.                               END10:31 A.M. EDT"	talk.politics.misc

Have you ever asked aphysically blind person why he or she follows a seeing eye dog?The answer is quite simple--the dog can see, and the blind personcannot.	I acknowledge, as a Christian, that I am blind.  I see,but I see  illusions as well as reality.  (Watched TV lately?)I hear, but I hear lies as well as truth.  (Listen to your radio or read a newspaper.)  Remember, all that tastes well isnot healthy.  So, I rely one the one who can see, hear, andtaste everything, and knows what is real, and what is not.That is God.	Of course, you may ask, if I cannot trust my own senses,how do I know whether what I see and hear about God is truth ora lie.  That is why we need faith to be saved.  We must forceourselves to believe that God knows the truth, and loves usenough to share it with us, even when it defies what we thinkwe know.  Why would He have created us if He did not love us enough to help us through this world?	I also do trust my experiences to some extent.  WhenI do things that defy the seeming logic of my experience, because it is what my Father commands me to do, and I seethe results in the long term, I find that He has led mein the proper direction, even though it did not feel rightat the time.  This is where our works as Christians areimportant:  As exercises of the body make the body strong,excercises of faith make the faith strong.  	As for you, no one can ""convert"" you.  You mustchoose to follow God of your own will, if you are ever tofollow Him.  All we as Christians wish to do is share withyou the love we have received from God.  If you reject that,we have to accept your decision, although we always keepthe offer open to you.  If you really want to find outwhy we believe what we believe, I can only suggest you trypraying for faith, reading the Bible, and asking Christiansabout their experiences personally.  Then you may grow tounderstand why we believe what we do, in defiance of thelogic of this world.	May the Lord bring peace to you, 						Malcusco         "	soc.religion.christian

The heat sourceis a 100 watt light bulb.  Basically, it's a vertical wooden box withventilation holes in the top and bottom (lots of them, you want the airto flow).  The light bulb goes in the bottom, and wire cake racks arespaced every 6"" starting about 10"" above the bulb.Or, at a slightly higher cost in electricity, you can do what I do:  Useyour oven.  (NOTE - I do this in an electric oven; some gas ovens maynot have a low enough setting).  Put food to be dried on cookie tins orracks in the oven.  Set oven to 140 degrees (the lowest setting on myoven - if yours goes down to 120 that's probably even better.)  Stick awooden spoon or something across the front corner of the oven and closethe door on the spoon so that it stays open about an inch - this allowsfor airflow.  Leave the stuff in the oven for 6 to 8 hours; check itoften, since this dries it much faster than the dehydrator.

MY REPLY...One of the reasons I have given a different exegetical view of the passages isthat you seem to think the majority of scholarship is wrong in concluding thesepassages are complimentary.  However, I see no problem in Tony Rose'sexplanation of Judas' death... _____________________________________________________________________ HOW WOULD YOU EXPLAIN THE INACCURACY BETWEEN JUDAS HANGINGHIMSELF IN MATTHEW 27:5 AND ""FALLING HEADLONG HE BURST OPEN""============================================================= This question of the manner in which Judas died is one with which we areconstantly confronted in our travels. Many people point to the apparentdiscrepancy in the two accounts as an obvious, irreconcilable error.Some have gone so far as to say that the idea of an inerrant Bible isdestroyed by these contradictory accounts. However, this is not the case atall.Matthew relates that Judas hanged himself, while Peter tells us he fell andwas crushed by the impact. The two statements are indeed different, but dothey necessarily contradict each other?Matthew does not say that Judas did not fall; neither does Peter say thatJudas did not hang himself. This is not a matter of one person callingsomething black and the other person calling it white. Both accounts can betrue and supplementary.A possible reconstruction would be this: Judas hanged himself on a tree on theedge of a precipice that overlooked the valley of Hinnom. After he hung therefor some time, the limb of the tree snapped or the rope gave way and Judasfell down the ledge, mangling his body in the process.The fall could have been before *or* after death as either would fit thisexplanation. This possibility is entirely natural when the terrain of thevalley of Hinnom is examined.  From the bottom of the valley, you can seerocky terraces 25 to 40 feet in height and almost perpendicular.There are still trees around the ledges and a rocky pavement at the bottom.Therefore, it is easy to conclude that Judas struck one of the jagged rocks onthis way down, tearing his body open. It is important to remember that we arenot told how long Judas remained hanging from the tree or how advancedwas the decomposition of his body before his fall.Louis Gaussen relates a story of a man who was determined to kill himself.This individual placed himself on the sill of a high window and pointed apistol at his head. He then pulled the trigger and leaped from the window atthe same time.On the other hand, a person could say that this man took his life by shootinghimself, while another could rightly contend he committed suicide by jumpingform the tall building. In this case, both are true, as both are true in thecase of Matthew's and Peter's accounts of the death of Judas. It is merely asituation of different perspectives of the same event. _____________________________________________________________________ Your only reason for rejecting this is, I believe, your attempt to discreditinerrancy.  You haven't related how this is IMPOSSIBLE or highly unlikely.Here's what you said in an earlier post... _____________________________________________________________________DB [quoting Tony Rose]...> There are still trees around the ledges and a rocky pavement at the bottom.> Therefore, it is easy to conclude that Judas struck one of the jagged rocks> on this way down, tearing his body open.

But you haven't addressed why you feel that way.  You can sayit's a vain attempt to reconcile the contradiction, but that doesn't tell me itdidn't happen, nor have you shown why you reject that possibility. Questions:  Is Matthew lying or is Luke lying?  Or are they both lying?  Orare either or both of them misinformed?  Why do you think there is such analleged contradiction?  I do not think you have ever told us what you believein this respect. DB...""At present though, Mr DeCenso only asks two questions of me: > (1) You claim Acts and Matthew contradict one another in representing Judas'>     death.  I ask you again to provide evidence that Matthew stated Judas>     died in the hanging.> (2) You claim that the 30 pieces of silver in Matthew that Judas threw down>     in the temple and the chief priests used, is the ""reward of iniquity"">     in Acts that pictures Judas in some way purchasing a field with;>     therefore there is a contradiction.  Prove that the 30 pieces of silver>     and the ""reward of iniquity"" are one and the same. Actually I find question (1) to be a rather stupid request, but I will answerit because he now restricts himself to two points.  First I would point outthat hanging is a very efficient manner for ending a life.  In fact it is abit of a fluke when someone survives hanging (except in fantasy cowboymovies), and even then it usually referred to as an attempted hanging."" MY REPLY...I work at an agency that investigates child abuse and neglect.  Today, I got acall re: a child that attempted suicide by hanging himself because his motheris on crack.  He failed in his attempt and is in a child's psych ward at alocal hospital.  Hanging attempts are not always successful. To assume that because most hangings are successful, this one was also is""begging the question"", if I may quote you. [Last night, listening to _The Bible Answer Man_ broadcast, The ChristianResearch Institute's show, one of the scholars on there used several of theseterms that you use.  I am not all that familiar with them.  The man on the BAMshow teaches Comparative Religion and Logic.  It was interesting] DB...""This is so prevalent that, so that to say a man hung himself with no otherqualifiers is synonymous with stating that he killed himself."" MY REPLY...Qualifiers are important at times, as we'll see in an OT passage I'll mentionbelow.Does hanging ALWAYS have this outcome?  Did Matthew, who is the only source wehave re: Judas hanging himself, state that Judas died as a result?  To say it'ssynonymous means it has the same meaning as.  A boy (age 14) hung himself.  Buthe lived.  This is only one of probably thousands of documented cases we candiscover. DB...""Now I am not alone in this thought; in fact, since Mr DeCenso so respectsChristian scholarly (including Greek scholars) opinion, I did some research."" MY REPLY...Thank you, Dave. DB...""Interestingly, not one of the Christian references I read, interpreted thehanging as being anything but a fatal suicide.              ^^^^^^^^^^^ MY REPLY...[^^^ above, mine]So it's OK to use Christian sources to back your points?

I am sure _you_ would findsome errors and maybe even some deception in those sources. You also noted they ""interpreted"" the hanging as meaning he died.

MY REPLY...[^^^ above, mine]No you can't only conclude this, although, as Tony says, this was a highlyprobable outcome.  But Matthew does not state death as being a result. The Greek word is APAGCHO.  Matthew 27:5 is it's only occurrence in the NewTestament. In the Septuagint (the Greek translation of the OT used at the time of Jesus),it's only used in 2 Samuel 17:23 : ""Now when Ahithophel saw that his advice wasnot followed, he saddled a donkey, and arose and went home to his house, to hiscity. Then he put his household in order, and hanged himself, and died; and hewas buried in his father's tomb.""             ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ Notice that not only is it stated that Ahithophel ""hanged himself"" [Gr. Sept.,APAGCHO], but it explicitly adds, ""and died"".  Here we have no doubt of theresult.In Matthew, we are not explicitly told Judas died. Also, there is nothing in the Greek to suggest success or failure.  It simplymeans ""hang oneself"". DB...""But Mr DeCenso, you are more than welcome to disagree and show more reputable                                                                     ^^^^^^^^^Christian scholars that insist that the hanging was not successful."" MY REPLY...[^^^above, mine]""Reputable""?  You mean ones that have never erred?As far as   insisting that the hanging was unsuccessful, that can't be done,even by me. ^^^^^^^^^ As I said in an earlier post... _____________________________________________________________________Although I still agree with Tony's exegesis as being the most probableexplanation regarding Judas' death (taking into account several criteria),I've recently noticed some new things in Matthew. MAT 27:5-8 Then he threw down the pieces of silver in the temple and departed,and went and hanged himself. But the chief priests took the silver pieces andsaid, ""It is not lawful to put them into the treasury, because they are theprice of blood."" And they consulted together and bought with them the potter'sfield, to bury strangers in. Therefore that field has been called the Field ofBlood to this day. First of all, notice that the text does not say that Judas died as a result ofhanging. All it says is that he ""went and hanged himself."" Luke however, inActs, tells us that ""and falling headlong, he burst open in the middle and allhis entrails gushed out."" This is a pretty clear indication (along with theother details given in Acts - Peter's speech, the need to pick a new apostle,etc.) that at least after Judas' fall, he was dead. So the whole concept that                                                    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^Matthew and Luke both recount Judas' death is highly probable, but not clear^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^cut.^^^_____________________________________________________________________ I also wrote... _____________________________________________________________________MY REPLY... Here we have a stickler, Dave, that I have to say I just recently noticed.Let's look at the passage in Matthew: MAT 27:4 saying, ""I have sinned by betraying innocent blood."" And they said,""What is that to us? You see to it!"" MAT 27:5 Then he threw down the pieces of silver in the temple and departed,and went and hanged himself. MAT 27:6 But the chief priests took the silver pieces and said, ""It is notlawful to put them into the treasury, because they are the price of blood."" MAT 27:7 And they consulted together and bought with them the potter's field,to bury strangers in. MAT 27:8 Therefore that field has been called the Field of Blood to this day. Notice verse 5...""Then he...went and hanged himself.""Matthew does not say Judas died, does it?  Should we assume he died as aresult of the hanging?                     ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^What does Acts say?ACT 1:18 (Now this man purchased a field with the wages of iniquity; andfalling headlong, he burst open in the middle and all his entrails gushed out. ACT 1:20 ""For it is written in the book of Psalms: 'Let his dwelling place bedesolate, And let no one live in it'; and, 'Let another take his office.' Here we may have a graphic explanation of Judas' death....So, my line ofreasoning to dispel your contradiction myth re:the ""two"" accounts of Judas'death is this...Matthew doesn't necessarily explain how Judas died; he does                ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^say Judas ""hanged himself"", but he didn't specifically say Judas died in thehanging incident.               ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^However, Acts seems to show us his graphic demise.  Therefore, there is nocontradiction between Matthew and Acts re: Judas' `death'. ....... MY REPLY......we do know from Matthew that he did hang himself and Acts probably recordshis death.  Although it's possible and plausible that he fell from the hangingand hit some rocks, thereby bursting open, I can no longer assume that to bethe case.  Therefore, no contradiction.

MY REPLY...The outcome of any fall is dependent upon many factors...how high the personwas suspended before the fall, any obstructions such as tree branches that mayhave deviated the fall, how steep an incline of rocky surfaces the victim fellupon, thus possibly rolling or bouncing of several rocks, etc.  In asuperficial examination of the Acts passage and the Matthew passage, we are notgiven a lot of info on the geographical specifics, but Tony in the above quotedpost gave us some... _____________________________________________________________________A possible reconstruction would be this: Judas hanged himself on a tree on theedge of a precipice that overlooked the valley of Hinnom. After he hung therefor some time, the limb of the tree snapped or the rope gave way and Judasfell down the ledge, mangling his body in the process.The fall could have been before *or* after death as either would fit thisexplanation. This possibility is entirely natural when the terrain of thevalley of Hinnom is examined.  From the bottom of the valley, you can seerocky terraces 25 to 40 feet in height and almost perpendicular.There are still trees around the ledges and a rocky pavement at the bottom.Therefore, it is easy to conclude that Judas struck one of the jagged rocks onthis way down, tearing his body open._____________________________________________________________________ DB...Now truthfully, I do not see what is comforting about Matthew confusing thesource of the Potter's field prophesy, but on the other hand the author iscorrect: Matthew does make that confusion.  Of course a Biblical inerrantistwho claim that every word of the Bible is guaranteed true by God, will have tothereby add one more contradiction to the death of Judas (ie: where theprophesy of the Potter's field came from)."" MY REPLY...Please, when we are done with this study on his death, remind me to discussthis with you. DB...As to your second question Mr DeCenso, you ask how we could be sure that themoney with which Judas purchased the land, was indeed for the betrayal, ratherthan some other source.  I would point out that in Acts, where it specificallymention ""the reward of iniquity"" [Acts 1:18], it also specifically mentionswhat act of iniquity they were talking about (ie: Acts 1:16 ""...concerningJudas who was guide to those who arrested Jesus."").  Now I would point outthat when the Bible describes an act of ""iniquity,"" and then immediatelydiscusses ""*the* reward of iniquity,"" it would be rather inane to suggest thatit was an action of iniquity other than the one discussed."" MY REPLY...Dave, we are getting somewhere, aren't we! ACT 1:15 And in those days Peter stood up in the midst of the disciples(altogether the number of names was about a hundred and twenty), and said,ACT 1:16 ""Men and brethren, this Scripture had to be fulfilled, which the HolySpirit spoke before by the mouth of David concerning Judas, who became a guideto those who arrested Jesus;ACT 1:17 ""for he was numbered with us and obtained a part in this ministry.""ACT 1:18 (Now this man purchased a field with the wages of iniquity; andfalling headlong, he burst open in the middle and all his entrails gushed out.ACT 1:19 And it became known to all those dwelling in Jerusalem; so that fieldis called in their own language, Akel Dama, that is, Field of Blood.)ACT 1:20 ""For it is written in the book of Psalms: 'Let his dwelling place bedesolate, And let no one live in it'; and, 'Let another take his office.' Notice that in verse 16, the word ""iniquity"" is not used.  Rather, it statesthat Judas ""became a guide to those who arrested Jesus"".But the writer DID NOT stop there...vs. 17, ""for he was numbered with us andobtained a part in this ministry.""  What part did Judas play in their ministry?         ^^^^^^JOH 12:6 This he said, not that he cared for the poor, but because he was athief, and had the money box; and he used to take what was put in it.JOH 13:29 For some thought, because Judas had the money box, that Jesus hadsaid to him, ""Buy those things we need for the feast,"" or that he should givesomething to the poor. So, now we know what part Judas played - he was a treasurer, per se.Right after Peter stated that Judas played a part in this ministry (treasurer,according to John), THEN Luke adds the parenthetical explanation of ""wages ofiniquity"" - money that should have been put into the ministry, but was stolenby Judas to purchase a field.  I believe this is a better exegeticalexplanation of what the ""wages of iniquity"" are.  What do you think, Dave? DB...""Now since I have given you clear answers (and even references), perhaps youcould unequivocally state what type of inerrantist you are (instead of askingme what type I think you are, as you did to Mr Joslin).""

What is the source of this pseudo-doctrine? Who is> the pseudo-teacher? Who is the Great Deceiver?OK, here's at least one Christian's answer:Jesus was a JEW, not a Christian.  In this context Matthew 5:14-19 makessense.  Matt 5:17 ""Do not think that I [Jesus] came to abolish the Law orthe Prophets; I did not come to abolish, but to fulfill.""  Jesus livedunder the Jewish law.  However, He was the culmination of the promisesof the Prophets.  He came to *fulfill* the prophecies and fully obeyGod's purposes.Verse 18 says ""For truly I say to you, until heaven and earth passaway, not the smallest letter or stroke shall pass away from the Law,until all is accomplished.""  The key to this verse IMHO is the last phrase.  Jesus, as the fulfillment of the law, ""accomplished"" what the Law was supposed to accomplish.  Verse 19:  ""Whoever then annuls one of the least of these commandments,and so teaches others, shall be called least in the kingdom of heaven;but whoever keeps and teaches them, he shall be called great in thekingdom of heaven.""  Taken in the context of Jesus teaching Jewish people about living lives under the law, this makes sense.In general, it appears that Jesus is responding to some criticism he must have received about ""doing away with the Law.""  That was not Jesus' intent at all.  He had come to earth to live the Law as it should be lived and fulfill the promises made by God to his people all the way back to Eve [Gen 3:15-The serpent will bruise your heel, but *He* will bruise his head.]  Jesus appeared to be ""doing away with the Law"" because he did not honor the traditions of men as equal to the Law of God.  He regularly locked horns with the religious leaders of the day because he would not conform to *their* rules, only God's Law.In the Matthew passage Jesus is defending his dedication to the Law and defending himself against his accusors.  Almost the entire Sermon on the Mount (Matt. 5-7) is dedicated to helping the Jewish people understand the true intent of the Law, sweeping away the clutter which had been introduced by the Pharasees and their traditions.In Galatians 3:23-26, Paul describes the relationship of Jesus to the Law in this way:[23] But before faith came, we were kept in custody under the law, being shut up to the faith which was later to be revealed.  [24] Therefore the Law has become our tutor to lead us to Christ, that we may be justified by faith.  [25]  But now that faith has come, we are no longer under a tutor.  [26] For you are all sons of God through faith in Christ Jesus.I believe this says that after Christ was revealed, the Law had served it's purpose, i.e. ""our tutor to lead us to Christ,"" andnow, ""we are no longer under a tutor.""  The law has been ""fulfilled"" as Christ said he would do.God, the author of the old Law, and the Christ/Man, Jesus, are the samepersonality.  Therefore, the old Law and the new Testament (the ""lastwill and testament"" of Jesus) are based on the same moral principles. It makes sense that many of the principles in the old Law arere-expressed in Christianity. On the other hand, now that the Law has fulfilled it's purpose and Christians relate to God through Christ, not the Law, it also makes sense that new practices and new symbolisms were established to represent the ""mysteries"" of this new relationship.  i.e. Baptism representing Christ's death, burial, and resurrection (Rom. 6:3-8),The Lord's supper as a memorial to His sacrifice (I Cor. 11:26), andSunday as a day of worship commemorating His resurrection (Matt 28:1ff,Acts 20:7)OK, That's one Christian's explanation.  I don't claim to have allthese issues completely settled even in my own mind and I welcomeother Christians to offer other alternatives.Please excuse the long posting.

One Friday, one Saturday, and a good-old Sunday doubleheader.""What could be better,"" declared Ernie Banks.  Perhaps the fact that the Cubsare challenging?     ""It's pitching, it's always been pitching that we've lacked,"" announcedRyne Sandberg.  ""If we can get by Brewer, then beat Carlton, Alexander, orBunning - preferrably 2 of the last three - we'll know we might be able towin.     ""Lord, I hope we pull it off.""     The Phils scored once in the top of the first; Richie Ashburn singled, PeteRose followed with a hit, sending Ashburn around second.  Kiki Cuyler cutthe ball off in left center, and threw a bullet in to Ernie Banks, who threwto Ron Santo to get Ashburn at third.  Rose went to second on the play.     Christobel Torrienti lifted a long fly to center, moving Pete Rose tothird.  Schmidt was walked - the Cubs were absolutely refusing to let himbeat them.  Both Torrienti and Schmidt will likely draw 130-150 walks thisyear.  Chuck Klein is starting to hit very well, and he lashed a double into agap in right-center.  ""Cool Papa"" Bell's speed allowed him to cut the ball offand prevent Schmidt from scoring.  Nellie Fox was walked, and Bob Boonegrounded out to second, ending the threat.       ""Teams are starting to realize that you don't have to pitch to Schmidt orTorrienti, and that is lowering their run total.  It puts a lot of pressure onKlein and Dick Allen (who platoons with Chuck Klein and occasionally spellsRose at first), and it's a credit to the Phillies that they've been able tosustain their pace.  The picthers have slumped at times.""  So came theanalysis from Frank Chance.     The Cubs got that run back when Bell bunted for a hit, Thomas' groundermoved him to second, and - after Sandberg made out - Billy Williams singledhome a run.  In the sixth, Ron Santo launched a two-run homer to make it3-1.  Dick Redding got in trouble in the eighth, as Schmidt singled and Kleinsingled him to third.  Ed Reulbach entered to face Fox, but Dick Allen poppedout of the dugout to hit.  Allen doubled to right, but luckily for the Cubs,Williams had moved to left and Andre Dawson had been inserted for defense.He fired a bullet to home plate to keep Klein at third.  Lance Parrish, hittingfor Boone, was walked, and Bruce Sutter entered.  Larry Bowa grounded intoa 1-2-3 double play, but Ed Delahanty walked as a pinch-hitter.  Desiring astrikeout, since Ashburn was likely to attempt a bunt hit with the quickTrillo pinch-running at third, Chance brought in Lee Smith, who induced apop-up to the catcher from the speedy centerfielder, ending the inning.  TheCubs took the win, 3-2, moving a game behind the Phillies.     Steve Carlton was called upon to battle 3-Finger Brown Saturday.  To getanother righthander in the lineup, Ron Santo moved to first and Bill Madlockplayed third.  Unfortunately, Brown allowed six doubles, and the Cub bullpenwas worn down even more, as the Cubs tried to maintain a lead againstLefty.  Madlock, batting sixth, had knocked two doubles of his own, drivinghome four runs.  Gabby Hartnett hit two home runs, and Cuyler addedanother, and the score was 8-6, Cubs after six innings.  The Phillie bullpenhad more troubles in the bottom of the eighth, as the Cubs grabbed 3 moreruns to ice an 11-7 triumph.     Sunday's twin bill saw Cool Papa Bell gather seven straight hits at onepoint, including a rare outside-the-park home run in the second game, offRobin Roberts.  Grover Alexander of the Phils took the first contest, 4-2, butthe Cubs captured the second one 5-4, with Waddell gaining the win.  BruceSutter tossed two innings for the save, though he allowed one run in theeighth.  The Cardinals stood half a game behind these co-leaders, and wouldconclude their series with the Expos on Monday.-------------------------------------------------------------------     Montreal at St. Louis(August 3-6): 3-way tie for 1st     Dennis Martinez is on a roll, and he continued it versus John Tudor Friday.The Expos have a wide variety of hitters, and - while they aren't among theall-time greats, they are getting the job done.  After winning their firstfirst two games, they suddenly found themselves only 2 1/2 games out offirst in this wacky season.     Martinez triumphed 5-3 on Friday, and WIlliams outdueled Dizzy Dean 3-2Saturday.  However, the Cardinals refused to give up, winning 6-2 on Sunday.The Cards captured Monday's game, too, as Steve Carlton outdueled SteveRogers 3-2.  ""We're really good against ground ball pitchers because of ourteam speed,"" remarked Lou Brock.  ""I don't see why we can't win thisdivision.""     The Phillies and Cubs may have some reasons for them.  Two-thirds ofthe way through the season, there is a 3-way tie for first.-------------------------------------------------------------------     New York at Pittsburgh(August 3-6): 3 straight 3-2 wins for Bucs,now 2 back - but in 4th!    ""When your team is in a slump like we are, the worst thing is to play in apitcher's park like this,"" spoke Gil Hodges before the series.  KeithHernandez added that ""their defense takes away quite a few runs per year,and it must be giving them an extra 6-7 wins.""  The Pirates have made only26 errors all season, 6 ahead of the second place Dodgers.  Error totals tendto be around 50 for the best defensive All-Time teams.     Rube Foster defeated Sid Fernandez 5-2 Friday, and Candelaria outshoneSeaver 3-2 Saturday, in a game featuring some outstanding defense.  WhenNolan Ryan and two relivers 6-hit the Mets in another 3-2 win Sunday, thePirates could once again look forward to a victory getting them back to the.500 mark.  They had been unable to several times in the past month.  BertBlyleven met Dwight Gooden in the afternoon game.  Both pitchers possessedfantastic stuff, and the only runs scored through eight innings were on homeruns - a solo shot by Rusty Staub of the Mets and a two-run blast by RalphKiner for the Pirates.  The Mets' Darryl Strawberry singled home a run in thetop of the ninth off Jesse Orosco, working his second inning, after MookieWilson pinch-ran for Gary Carter at second.  With one out and a runner onfirst, Lee Mazilli was sent in to pinch-hit.  The Pirates countered with KentTekulve, placing him in the fifth spot in the order and putting Barry Bonds inleft field as the ninth place hitter.  Tekulve induced a groundout forcingStrawberry at second.  He slid hard into Honus Wagner, preventing thePirates from turning their fifth double play of the afternoon.  Tekulveallowed a hit, but Clemente threw Mazilli out at third from near the rightfield line, ending the inning.  Tug McGraw relieved Randy Myers, who enteredto pitch the eighth, and got one out before Bonds launched a rocket to deepcenter, running through the stop sign at third to score an inside-the-parkhomer to win.  The Pirates had scored an improbable 3 straight 3-2 wins,and had moved to within 2 games of first place, with seven weeks to go.------------------------------------------------------------------     San Francisco at Boswaukta(August 3-5):     Another Sunday doubleheader appeared on the schedule, as the Giantsmanaged to close the gap on the other teams thanks to some startingpitching that just wouldn't tire.  In fact, reported manager John McGraw,""once this rough part of the schedule is over, maybe as early as this comingweek, we may shift to a 4-man rotation again for a little while.""     Juan Marichal continued his hot pitching Friday, beating Lew Burdette andthe Braves 4-1.  Willie Mays had all four r.b.i.s on 3 hits.  Rick Reuschelfaced Joe Niekro Saturday in a slugfest.  The Braves' park had been a homerhaven, but this took the cake, as the Giants won a seesaw affair 16-13.Willie Mays had three homers, Willie McCovey, Eddie Matthews, and DonBaylor had two, and Hank Aaron, Ernie Lombardi, Biz Mackey, and Mel Ott hadone each.  The Braves had collected 149 home runs going into Sunday'sdoubleheader, putting them on a pace for 223, which would be 4 short of theNational League record.  They were still a tad behind the '61 Yankees' pace.They had allowed over 120, though.  Vida Blue actually got the win afterretiring 2 batters in the fifth.  He allowed only a run in the sixth, butfaltered in the seventh.  Joe McGinnity earned the save.     In the doubleheader, the Braves' Hoyt Wilhelm failed to hold a lead in thefirst game, but Hank Aaron homered off Bill Foster in the eighth as theBraves won, 4-3.  The Giants took the second game, however, by a 6-2 score.The homer by Aaron was a magical #150 by the Braves; however, they fell tothree game below .500, making a comeback extremely unlikely.-------------------------------------------------------------------     San Diego at Cincinnati(Aug. 3-5):  Randy Jones faced EwellBlackwell in the first of this 3-game series, and the Padres felt rathergood.  With Don Mattingly straining his back in the last Cleveland game, thetrade looked even better.  McGriff's batting average was even rising.  Ofcourse, the bench was very poor, and Joe Gordon was only adequate in theoutfield, but these were minor problems, since the pitching was holding up.     Jones pitched a good game Friday, and won 6-3.  McGriff launched twohome runs.  Mel Harder earned a win with the help of Mark Davis and RayNarleski Saturday; 5-4 was the final score.  Tom Candiotti battled SatchelPaige to a 3-3 tie through eight innings before departing.  The game wasscoreless for 4 more innings until the thirteenth.  Paige had departed after10, and John Franco hurled a scoreless inning.  Tom Browning was workinghis second scoreless inning, when Dave Winfield doubled with one out andJoe Gordon was pitched around.  Thurm Munson doubled both runners home,and the Padres gamed a 5-3 win.  The three-game sweep had pulled theGiants into a tie with the Reds.  Though the Reds denied it, the highlyemotional series with the Dodgers may have taken too much out of them.-------------------------------------------------------------------     Brookangeles at Houston(August 3-5):     Another series capped off by a weekend doubleheader took place in thewide open plains of the Astrodome.  The Astros sent Joe Niekro to the hill inthe first game, opposite Don Drysdale.  ""Normally,"" Drysdale remarked, ""Iwould be challenging hitter by being ready to throw at them.  I can't affordto with this team, though; we have to get our own runners going; we can'tafford to let the Astros beat us.""  He then winked and said: ""Well, maybeDavis will get decked once.""     The fact that Glenn Davis leads the team in homers with six (!) isprimarily why he would be decked, but it should be understood that hiscurrent pace would give him nine for the season.  The hitting on this team isa little better, but the power is all doubles and triples.  Still, Carl Furillo isthe main reason no Astro home runs were hit over the weekend, as he threwtwo runners out trying for inside-the-park homers.  For those unaware ofthe nastness of the Astros' park, they have a 23-foot high gray wall allaround the outfield; balls must be hit into the seats to be home runs.  Thefoul poles are 355 feet from home plate, but the alleys are 400 feet away,with center field at 420 feet.  ""It's as if some three-year-old threw atantrum and told his playmates: 'If I can't hit home runs, nobody will hithome runs',"" remarked Roy Campanella.     The Dodgers stole five bases Friday, but the Astros decided to revitalizethe Baltimore chopping that had failed 6 weeks before; for tonight, anyway,Davis, Jim Wynn, and Jose Cruz did not have to mess with their swings,according to the manager.  After Poles and Willie Wells reached base via theBaltimore chop, Drysdale decked Jose Cruz with a pitch.  He responded witha two-run double, but Wynn - playing first for Davis - popped up, and theAstros didn't score any more in that inning.  They did score 3 in the fourth toerase a 3-2 deficit, and the Astros wound up winning 6-4.  They threatenedto do even better the next game, as Tommy John would be their opponent.Walt Alston met privately with the starters at 6 A.M. before the game.     ""I think I know how we can beat the Baltimore Chop,"" he explained.     ""How can we do that,"" Pee Wee Reese wondered.     ""They're going to be beating the ball down, so we've got to be ready tothrow on the run.  Steve will start at first to dig balls out of the dirt, but Iwant all of you to practice your barehanded picks and throws.  We'll go witha shallow infield almost the whole time.""     The plan almost worked.  Mike Scott allowed only two runs through eightinnings, but the Astros got three; two of them scored when Bill Doranpushed a bunt into the outfield in the fourth with runners on second andthird.  3-2 Astros was the final, with Dave Smith earning another save.  TheDodgers scored a victory in the first game of the twin bill Sunday, as NolanRyan walked five, three of whom scored in a 4-1 Dodger win.  FernandoValenzuela lost the second game 4-2 to Don Sutton, however, as the Dodgers'thirteen stolen bases in the series proved to not be enough.     ""We're mostly a power team,"" remarked Ron Cey.  ""Jackie and, when heplays, Maury Wills are our only real speed demons, though a couple otherplays can do it now and then.  We're sunk in a place like the Astrodome.  Iguess that's why they're so successful there.""  Indeed, it seems thatbasestealing teams give them the most trouble in the dome.  The 'Strosswiped 12 bases in 16 attempts, giving them 230 on the season.

"From: Amruth Laxman <al26+@andrew.cmu.edu>Subject: Surviving Large Accelerations?Hi,    I was reading through ""The Spaceflight Handbook"" and somewhere inthere the author discusses solar sails and the forces acting on themwhen and if they try to gain an initial acceleration by passing close tothe sun in a hyperbolic orbit. The magnitude of such accelerations heestimated to be on the order of 700g. He also says that this is may notbe a big problem for manned craft because humans (and this was publishedin 1986) have already withstood accelerations of 45g. All this is verylong-winded but here's my question finally - Are 45g accelerations infact humanly tolerable? - with the aid of any mechanical devices ofcourse. If these are possible, what is used to absorb the acceleration?Can this be extended to larger accelerations?Thanks is advance...-Amruth Laxman"	sci.space

When you ask it forsomething it knows about (mostly active IC parts), it works quite well.THey don't handle all the varieties of transistors or diodes that exist.It is definately a start in the right direction, but they need to expandthe data base to handle more types of stuff.These systems aren't cheap.

Subject: Flames Final Stats and Playoff NewsFrom: caldwell8102@mtroyal.ab.caNews:=====For the first time all season, the Flames are now injury-free. The only playerremaining on the limp is center Carey Wilson who, even when healthy, is not a major part of the team. Trent Yawney did not score a goal all season until the last regular seasongame against San Jose. He potted his first of the year in that game, and hasalso scored goals in both Game 1 and Game 2 against Los Angeles. Thoughts on Game 1:==================The Flames played horribly in dropping the first game of their series withLos Angeles 6-3 on Sunday afternoon. They seemed more interested in throwingbig hits than in scoring goals. They physically dominated the Kings, but thatwas the only area they dominated in. The game plan was to rush the net and try and take advantage of a young, inexperienced L.A. defence and the shakyKings goaltending, but those plans fell by the wayside while the Flamesconducted a steady march to the penalty box. Particularily stupid was TheorenFleury taking a five minute major and a game misconduct for slamming WarrenRychel's face into the dasher while Rychel was on his knees. Goaltender Mike Vernon played well and could not really be faulted for theloss, despite his well-publicized poor record in afternoon games. He gotvery little support from his defence in clearing the front of the net and sweeping away rebounds. In fact, Marty McSorley's goal actually went in offChris Dahlquist's skate in front of the net. Thoughts on Game 2:==================The Flames came back strong in the second game, evidently aware of thepotentially fatal consequences of losing both the first two games on home ice.The first period was fairly even, with the edge going to the Kings. But Calgarycame out strong in the second period and simply dominated the Kings, scoringfive goals to take a lead they never relinquished en route to a 9-4 win. The deciding factors in this game were faceoffs and special teams. Calgarydominated on faceoffs as they did in Game 1, but they were able to make betteruse of the won faceoffs in this game than they did in the first one. Calgaryalso went 3-for-5 on the powerplay while L.A. only went 1-for-8 and gave upa shorthanded goal to Joel Otto. L.A.'s powerplay goal also came late in thegame with the outcome already decided. The Kings' powerplay failed them whenthey needed it most, in the 1st and 2nd periods. The Flames lost RW Greg Paslawski with a suspected shoulder injury when hewas leveled by Alexei Zhitnik right after scoring Calgary's 7th goal. CharlieHuddy left the game for the Kings with a groin injury. The game was marred by stupidity in the last minute. First, Craig Berube ofCalgary took a five-minute major for fighting plus a game misconduct forinstigating when he went after Tony Granato for no apparent reason. Granatodrew a minor for some strange reason. (Turtling perhaps). This was followed30 seconds later by Warren Rychel drawing a major, minor, and game misconductfor hitting Frank Musil in the face with his stick and then instigating afight. Musil got a fighting major for some similarily strange reason. Hardy andYawney went toe-to-toe and both got double minors. (Gregson thought that Musil turtling amounted to fighting, but that Yawney and Hardy throwing punches at each other was just roughing? Where's this guy from.....)

There is no way in HELL you are going to be able to view GIFs or do: any other graphics in Linux without X windows!  I love Linux because it is: so easy to learn..  You want text?  Okay.   Use Linux. You want text AND: graphics?  Use Linux with X windows.  Simple.  Painless.  REQUIRED to have: X Windows if you want graphics!  This includes fancy word processors like: doc, image viewers like xv, etc.:Ummm, I beg to differ. A kind soul sent me a program called DPG-VIEW thatwill do exactly what I want, view GIF images under Linux without X-Windows.And, it does support all the way up to 1024x768. The biggest complaint Ihave is it is painfully SLOW. It takes about 1 minute to display an image.I am use to CSHOW under DOS which takes a split second. Any idea why itis so slow under Linux? Anybody have anything better? Plus, anybody havethe docs to DPG-View? Thanks! 	comp.graphics

Bill James is a partial owner of STATS, inc.  However he has almostnothing to do with the day-to-day operations of the company, although hedoes have significant input into the design of the books that bear his name.(The handbook, but not the scoreboard).  To the best of my knowledge, theonly things that Bill actually writes for STATS are the predictions sectionof the handbook, and the Bill James Fantasy Baseball rulebook.2.) The debate over Elias goes way back.  Bill James' early stuff was hamperedby the fact that Elias would not give access to their stats at any price.Project Scoresheet, and later, STATS were founded to fill this void.  Youcan call STATS, and ask them for a report on just about anything in theirdatabase, and they will provide it -- for a price, of course.  Or you couldjust log into their online system and look at the data yourself.  Havingattempted to pry numbers from Elias in the past (football, not baseball), theyjust don't do that.  In STATS eyes, the high ground comes from making theinformation available at all.3.)  That being said, I'm pretty dissapointed by Bill's book this year, too.I am given to understant that it was mostly a response to the publishers desire to have the book come out sooner than April.Hope this makes things just a little bit clearer.(Bias alert.  I am a former part-time employee of STATS.)Noel Rappinnoel@chaos.cs.brandeis.edu"	rec.sport.baseball

When he first mentioned it, I thought he wasjust making a mistake but then he said it over and over.  And then in theexamples from other years, he gave stats for players from both leagues evenwhen only one league expanded.So (since stats *NEVER* lie :-) ), I guess there is an effect on both leaguesbecause the expansion draft takes talent from both leagues equally making every team in both leagues dilute their major league talent by calling upplayers that, normally, they would not have had there not been expansion.Make sense?	rec.sport.baseball

When Bryan Murray took over the Wings they werea pretty good team that was contending for the Stanley Cup but lookedunlikely to win it.  Now they are a pretty good team that is contending forthe Stanley Cup but looks unlikely to win it.  A truly great GM wouldhave been able to make the moves to push the team to the upper echelonof the NHL and maybe win the Stanley Cup.  A good GM (like Murray) canmaintain the team's success but can't push them to the next level.In the history of hockey there have been several better GM's than Murray-way too many to name.  Murray isn't even the best GM in the league today.He fails in comparison to Sinden, Sather, Savard, Caron, Fletcher andQuinn in my estimation.I can't imagine how Bryan Murray can be the best GM anyone has ever seenin hockey- unless they have seen VERY few GM's.Gregmeister	rec.sport.hockey

From: krishnas@vax.oxford.ac.ukSubject: RE: HELP ME INJECT...The best way of self injection is to use the right size needleand choose the correct spot. For Streptomycin, usually given intramuscularly, use a thin needle (23/24 guage) and select a spot onthe upper, outer thigh (no major nerves or blood vessels there). Clean the area with antiseptic before injection, and after. Makesure to inject deeply (a different kind of pain is felt when theneedle enters the muscle - contrasted to the 'prick' when it pierces the skin).PS: Try to go to a doctor. Self-treatment and self-injection shouldbe avoided as far as possible. 	sci.med

From: charles@trintex.uucp (Charles Emmons)Subject: Version control for MAC and PC LANWe have a LAN where we are doing development on product for multiple platforms. For the moment we are only working on MAC and DOS/Windows. The department has   always used sneaker net to transport files to the MAC, since it requires a      filter to strip out the <LF> characters.                                        Until recently no one concidered using any version control to mediate, and as   a result, the 5 programmers spent a great deal of time merging files together   at the end of each week so that a new system could be build. We are now trying  to streamline this process, but are hampered by the lack of software that will  allow us to share files across PC and MAC platforms.                            I understand that PVCS used to do this, but that they no longer support the MAC product (anyone know why ??  Polytron ?).

The first two years consisted of five subjects:Software Engineering (Pascal/C/UNIX), Computer Engineering (6502/6809/68000 assembler), Computer Theory (LISP/Prolog), Mathematics/Statistics and Communication Skills (How to pass interviews/intelligence tests and groupdiscussions e.g. How to survive a helicopter crash in the North Sea).The third year (Industrial placement) was spent working for a computer company for a year. The company could be anywhere in Europe (there was a special Travel Allowance Scheme to cover the visiting costs of professors).  The fourth year included Operating Systems(C/Modula-2), Software Engineering (C/8086 assembler), Real Time Laboratory (C/68000 assembler) and Computing Theory (LISP).  There were also Group Projects in 2nd and 4th Years, where students worked in teams to select their own project or decide to work for an outside company (the only disadvantage being that specifications would change suddenly). In the first four years, there was a 50%:50% weighting between courseworks and exams for most subjects. However in the Honours year, this was reduced to a 30%:70% split between an Individual Project and final exams (no coursework assessment) - are all Computer Science courses like this?BTW - we started off with 22 students in our first year and were left with 8 byHonours year.

Why attract attention?  I carry my sword openly to and frompractice, as that is the only legal thing I can do.  I also attracta lot of attention doing this.  I'd rather be lost ""in a crowd of one""than be the subject of attention while carrying a weapon.

Todraw an analogy, Norway is involved in the EEC.  The USA in involved inNATO.  The EEC requires certain changes in your laws.  NATO requiresno such changes in USA law.  These laws affect citizens, and henceNorway is saying Europe is more important than, say, Norwegians havingmotorcycles that make over 100bhp.  In the USA, we'd likely tell theEEC to get stuffed since the EEC has no business, in our eyes, intelling us how much horsepower we can safely ride.  While I notethat our own state governments often play with game with the federalgovernment, in essence this is a cultural difference between us.>IF i lived in Amerika I would probably have a gun to defend myselfe in HOME.>But should it have to be like that ??	It shouldn't.

This is IMHO the *only* way of effectively >protecting software.There are several types of copy protection, and the point is to make sure theuser is using a legitimate copy.  The simplest and virtually fool-proof way isfor the program to somehow fixate itself to the machine it was installed on(some sort of checksum, serial number, whatever) so a copy put on a differentmachine (NOT installed from original disks) will not work.  The program is definitely backupable, if restored to the same machine (dependson the programmer...  don't use a disk drive characteristic!)  If the user did an upgrade to the machine, he/she should reinstall all programs any way.No document look-up, no disk wear-and-tear!I did not say that the originals would allow only one install.  The user's conscience should do that.I know, I'll get flamed for this...  But with the increasing number of ""casual""users who either unknowingly or don't care about the software copyrights(It's the truth.  I have ""friends"" who ask me for copies of my latest gamesall the time, and when I refused, they went after somebody else.), casualpirating is becoming more of a problem.  Some sort of copy protection willdiscourage the casual copying.  I've seen what some of my ""friends"" dug upsomewhere...  Latest and the greatest games, all cracked, WITHIN days of actualrelease!  You know how many bytes you need to change in X-wing to disablethe quiz?  TWO!  Yes, TWO!  (And don't ask me which ones they are.)  Determinedpirates are unstoppable, given enough time, but their results do not spread that far, since pirate boards are not that well-known, and easily tracked oncefound by authorities.  It is the ""casual"" pirates that the copy protection isdetermined to discourage.What I believe the companies should do is implement the above plusa special patch once the user registers that loudly exclaims upon bootup""REGISTERED TO XXXXX -- address, city, state zip"" and disables the above.Two benefits: 1) encourages registration, 2) cuts down on pirating andmakes it more traceable, because if the patch's registration message isencrypted, it will be quite hard to change, and therefore provides astable trail of who allowed their copy out of their hands, and thusviolated their license agreement.This way, the legitimate users who does not register will experience minimal discomfort (who does major upgrades to their computer frequently?) as onlyproblem they have is they won't be able to restore to another computer.The registered users would have proven they are legitmate users and thereforegains full rights, and can restore to different machines.  On the other hand,the software company now have a record of where THIS particular copy is supposed to be.  If this user's copy was found to be somewhere it was not supposed to be, we know who has broken their license agreement.  Of course,a hacker can break that eventually, but that's not the point, is it?--Kasey Chang"	sci.electronics

Dec. 1989Leading Israeli author and cultural commentator, A.B. Yehoshua,launched a ferocious attack on diaspora Jewry at a Zionist YouthCouncil meeting in North London, last week.The diaspora, he claimed, ""was the cancer connected to the maintissue of the Jewish people"". He was scathing about its failure toact before the Holocaust.He said the diaspora's religious and secular leadership hadignored the warning signs in the 1920s, and had fiercely opposedZionism. Consequently, he considered the Holocaust, ""the failureof Judaism"".His talk, entitled ""Diaspora: A Neurotic Solution"", covered 5,000years of Jewish history.Mr. Yehoshua's other targets included Soviet Jews who were, hesaid ""not staying [in Israel], but running [away]"", and all Jewsoutside Israel ""who were using other people's countries likehotels"".The only conclusion he could draw was that the diaspora wasimmoral, because it looked to Israel for its identity but livedelsewhere.Worse, it threatened Israel itself, creating a distraction for hercitizens, who were leaving by the thousands.Mr. Yehoshua, who described himself as ""a soldier for aliyah"",ended by calling for the creation of a new ""total Jew"", living inIsrael.Earlier, speaking at a meeting of Jewish students on thedifficulties of forging a national identity in Israeli literature,Mr. Yehoshua claimed that Israeli writers were paralyzed by thecountry's political situation.He said Israel's wars had once provided writers with a vitalsource of inspiration.  Today, Israeli writers avoided writingdirectly about the Arab-Israeli conflict. No major work had beenproduced about the intifada.Instead, writers were tackling themes such as Jewish identity,emigration from Israel and personal and family issues.Mr. Yehoshua admitted he also felt unable to write about theIsraeli political situation. He could no longer step into anIsraeli Arab's shoes and portray him as a real ""flesh and bloodcharacter"".He claimed that after 40 years of statehood, the problem ofIsraeli identity had not been solved. He said Jews remained toopre-occupied with the borders of identity between Jew and non-Jew,and were not concerned with the nature of that identity.Jewish values in Israel embraced every aspect of daily life,unlike in the diaspora, where Jews had no responsibility for thecountry they lived in, he said.He warned that modern Hebrew, a unifying force for the Jewishpeople, would have to struggle for its future, especially inliterary circles.

"From: simon@giaeb.cc.monash.edu.auSubject: St. Maria GorettiHeres the life of St. MAria Goretti, posted with kind permission ofthe editor of the Australian Catholic Magazine ""Morning Star"".Hope you like it.    Put up with anything to prevent sin St. Maria Goretti    Maria was born on October 16th 1890 to Luigi and Assunta Goretti,    the  eldest  daughter  in the family of seven. She was a cheerful    girl, always imitating her parents.  She had but one disire,  but    one wish: to receive our Lord in the Blessed Sacrament.    The date was finally set for little Maria to receive our Lord  on    the feast of Corpus Christi. For Maria, time seemed like an eter-    nity as she  slowly  neared  the  great  day.   When  it  finally    arrived, Fr. Jerome( the priest who was to celebrate the Mass and    give the children their First Holy Communion) delivered a  sermon    on	the  immense love of Jesus Christ for them and the great love    we should have in return for Him. He then warmly  urged  them  to    die rather than commit a mortal sin.    Maria humbly approached the Altar of God and  received  the  Holy    Eucharist.	Her  only  sadness  was  the  thought of her father's    absence, who died some time beforehand. As for the	rest  of  the    day,  Maria remained under the spell of the divine visit; that is    until				   -4-    her thoughts changed to when she could go next to Holy Communion.    Thus ended the happiest day of Maria's life.    Over the next twelve months, Maria had changed  from  a  giggling    little girl into a quiet young lady with responsibilities. As her    mother went out into the fields in place of  her  husband,	Maria    took  on the ironing, cooking, washing and other motherly duties.    She was doing this not only for her own family, but also for  the    Serenellis, a father and son who lived with the Goretti's, owning    a share in the farm. Although Maria was poorer than all the other    children, she by far surpassed them in virtue. In all thi ngs she    did the Holy Will of God.    During the month of June,  Alessandro  Serenelli(the  son)	twice    made advances upon Maria when he chanced to be alone with her. On    both occasions Maria managed to  struggle  free  of  Alessandro's    strong  grip, but on the second, he threatened to kill her if she    even uttered a word to her mother. From this day on, Maria	lived    in terror, fearing lest Alessandro attack again.    On July 5th 1902, Alessandro left work in the fields  to  ""get  a    handkerchief,""  as	he  claimed. He went to the storeroom beneath    the house where Maria, who was outside on the  landing  with  the    baby,  could  hear him fumbling about in with tools. She wondered    what he was doing. It was later learned that he was sharpening  a    91/2""  blade. He went to the house and called for Maria. She told    him she wouldn't go to him unless she knew why she was needed. He    stormed out to the landing and dragged her up to her room. Mar ia    instantly realized what he was up to. ""No, No, No! Do  not	touch    me!  It  is a sin, you will go to Hell!"" At this point Alessandro    held the knife over Maria's chest, who was now on the floor.    ""Will you or will you not?"" Maria gathered all her energy.	""No I    will  not,	Alessandro,  no!""   She had chosen her martyrdom over    sin, God over Satan.  Overcome with rage, Alessandro plunged  the    knife  into   Maria's  breast fourteen times.  Finally he came to    his senses and thought Maria was dead.  Frantically he threw  the    knife behind a closet and locked himself in his room.  The crying    of the baby Teresa	on  the  landing  brought  the	attention  to    Assunta  and the father of Alessandro. As the baby was unattended    and was in danger of falling off, they ran to the house  to  find    Maria,  who,  covered in blood, was dragging herself to the door.    When asked what happened she said Alessandro  stabbed  her.   ""He    wanted to make me do wrong and I would not.""    The ambulance arrived, then the police who took Alessandro	away.    As	the  ambulance	carried  Maria to the hospital, a large crowd    followed on foot.  The doctors at the  hospital held no hope  for    poor  little Maria.  The same Fr. Jerome who gave Maria her First    Communion				   -5-    came to administer the last rites and to give her Holy  Viaticum.    He asked Maria if she would forgive her murderer.  ""Yes.  For the    love of Jesus I forgive him.  I wish for him to one day  join  me    in	Paradise.   May  God forgive him, for I alread y have."" Maria    died at about three o'clock.    Alessandro was tried  and  found  guilty  of  Maria's  death  but    because  of  his  age  he  was  sentenced to only thirty years in    prison.  After eight  years of being a violent prisoner and show-    ing  no regret for his crime, he saw in a dream, in the  midst of    a field of flowers, Maria holding out a bunch of white lilies  to    him.  Soon later he wrote to the local bishop, begging God's par-    don for the grave sin he had committed.  He later gave  testimony    in	Maria's  beatification in 1947.  Less than three years later,    on Ju ne 24th 1950, Maria was canonised.  Assunta Goretti was the    first mother ever to be present at her daughter's canonisation.    May St. Maria Goretti help	us  to	be  pure  and  grant  us  the    strength to die rather than commit a mortal sin.

He got more attention from the media than was warranted from hisbaseball playing, though; his hype was a lot better than his hitting.That is the basis for the net.comments about him being overrated. Themedia would have you beleive he was a great hitter. I think he was agood, maybe very good hitter. He was IMO, something like the 30th besthitter in the majors.Clay D.	rec.sport.baseball

[1]Born 1964Secretary-TypistAzsantekmontazh TrustSumgait Construction and Installation AdministrationSecretary of the SMU Komsomol OrganizationResident at Building 17/33B, Apartment 15Microdistrict No. 3Sumgait [Azerbaijan]On the 27th my sister Marina and I went to the movies the seven o'clock show,at the theater that is across from the City Party Committee, about 50 yards away. The SK theater. They were showing an Argentinian film, ""The Abyss."" Before the film we noticed about 60 to 70 people standing near the podium at the City Party Committee, but they were silent, there's no conversation whatsoever, and we couldn't figure out what was going on. That is, we knew it was about Karabagh, but what it was exactly, what they were talking about, if someone gave a speech or not, we didn't know. We bought our tickets. There were 30 or 40 people in the theater. This was a very small number for that large movie theater. The film started. About 30 minutes later they stopped thefilm. A crowd burst in. About 60 people. They came up onto the stage. Well mostly they were young people, from 16 to 23 years old. They demanded that an Armenian woman come up onto the stage. They used foul language and said that they were going to show what Azerbaijanis were capable of, what they could do to Armenian girls. I thought that's what they meant because they had demanded a girl specifically. Marina and I were sitting together. I told her to move over, there were some Russian girls sitting nearby. So that if someone recognized me or if something happened, they would take me, and not Marina. It got quiet, 2 or 3 girls jumped up to run out, but the door was closed--it'sonly opened at the end of the   show--and they returned to their seats. Everyone in the theater was looking at one another, Russians, Azerbaijanis, people of various nationalities. But no one reacted at all, no one in the auditorium made a sound. They were silent, looking at one another, and gradually started to leave. Some guy, a really fat one, says, ""OK, we've scared them enough, let's leave."" They leave slowly, pompously. It seemed to me that those people were not themselves. Either they had smoked a bunch of ""anasha"", or had taken something else, because they all looked beastly, like they were ready to tear anyone apart. Then it was all over, as though nothing had happened at all. The film started up again, it was one of those cheerful films which should have only brought pleasure, made you happy to be alive. We could barely sit to the end. So it had started at seven it was over by nine, and it was dark . . .Marina and I were walking home, Lenin Street, that's the center of town. LeninStreet was packed, just packed with young people. They were shouting, something about Karabagh and something about Armenians. We weren't especially listening, because the way we were feeling we didn't know if we were going to make it home or not, and just what had happened anyway? Public transportation wasn't running. Incidentally, when we came out of the theater we saw police, policemen standing there. The director of the movie theater was looking at thedoors, because when they were leaving they had broken the glass, the doors there are basically all glass. Everything was broken. He stood there grief-stricken, but looking as though nothing really big had happened, like some naughty boys had just broken them quite by accident, with a slingshot. Well, since he looked more or less calm I decided that, nothing all that super serious had happened. We went out very slowly; we wanted to catch a bus, we live literally one stop away. We didn't want to go on foot, not because it wasdark, but because something might happen. We flagged down a cab, but the driver didn't want to take us. We told him we live near the bus station, and he said he'd take us to the bus station and not a yard farther. I said, well, OK . . .So we got into the cab and managed to get there. Something incredible was happening at the bus station. There was a traffic jam. Public transportation was at a standstill and everyone was shouting ""Ka-ra-bagh,"" they're not going to give up Karabagh. I go home and tell my family what's going on, and there'simmediate panic in the house. Mamma says, what should we do? Like the end had come, they were going to come, kill us, that's it . . . Somehow we managed to cheer ourselves up: Nothing that bad could happen. Where are we living anyway,just what kind of social order do we have? Somehow we manage to calm Mamma down. And we went to bed. But no one could sleep. Everyone made as though nothing had happened.That was on Saturday. In short, the day went by. We didn't go anywhere and didn't call our relatives. No one did anything. Because . . . life goes on.That day I realized something was approaching, but what exactly, I couldn'tguess.On the 28th everything was like it was supposed to be, we lived like we alwayshad. There were five of us at home: Mamma, Papa and us, three sisters: Lyuda, Marina, and I. My sister Lyuda was in Yerevan at the time. We sat at home and no one went out. Later we learned that a demonstration had started that morning. It all started . . . They were smashing up stores. We were sitting athome and didn't know anything about it. Then a girlfriend of mine, Lyuda Zimogliad, came by at around three o'clock I think. We worked together, we didour apprenticeships together, she's a Russian girl. She said that somethingawful was happening in town. I asked, ""Don't they want Armenians? Well what are they after, if they're already in that state?"" She says, no, nothing like that, it's just a demonstration, but it's awful to watch it. Somehow, it feelslike a war has broken out. Public transportation has been stopped . . . The cabs, the buses, well it's just a nightmare.Then Papa decides to go to the drugstore, my mother was having allergy problems at the time . . . He left the house and our neighbor, Aunt Vera,asked him, ""Where are you going? Stop! There are such terrible things goingon in the courtyard; aren't you afraid to go out?"" Papa didn't know what shewas talking about. She simply pushed him back into the entryway. He came home and told Mamma. Mamma said, ""Well, if Aunt Vera was talking like that it meansthat something is really going on."" But we didn't go see her, she's a Russian,she lives across from us. I had to see my friend out. Around five o'clock I tell Lyuda, ""Ok, look, it's time for you to go, it's late already, I'll see you out."" Mamma says, ""You don't need to go, it's too late already, you can see what the situation in town is."" So we decided to stay home. Dinner was ready. Mamma says, ""Let her eat with us, then she can go."" We sat down at the table. But no one was hungry, no one was in the mood, we just put everything out on the table to calm ourselves down, and make it appear that we're eating.We turned on the television, and the show ""In Fairy-Tale Land"" was coming on. We cleared the table.We hear some noise out in the courtyard. I go out on the balcony, but I can't see what's going on, because the noise is coming from the direction of the busstation, and there is a 9-story building in the way. There is mob of people . . . I can't figure out what's happening. They're shouting something, lookingsomewhere, I can't make out what is going on. I go down to a neighbor, she's an Azerbaijani; we've been friends of her family for about 25 years. I go downto look from their place. I see people shouting, looking at the 5-and 9-story buildings near the bus station. Just then soldiers set upon them, about 20 people, with clubs. The mob runs off in different directions. I even see several people from our building. They are looking and laughing . . . I decidethat means it's not all that bad if they are laughing: it means they're not killing anyone. But now the crowd suddenly dashes toward the soldiers. One of the soldiers cannot manage to get away, they start stomping on him with their feet, everyone's kicking him . . . I become ill and go home, and explain in general terms that horrible things are going on out there . . .  can't speak. . . Well, they've probably killed that soldier, the way that crowd is . . .If each of them kicked him just once . . . They took his club away from himand started to beat him with it. But it was far away and I couldn't see if hegot up and left or not.I become terrified and go home and say, ""Lyuda, don't go anywhere, stay at ourplace, because if you go out they could kill you or . . . "" Then the crowd runs over closer toward our building and stands at the 12-story building and starts shouting something. We go out onto the balcony. All of our neighbors are also out on theirs, too. Everyone is standing, staring. The mob is shouting and about 5 minutes later comes running toward our building. As it turns out, at the 12-story building the Azerbaijani neighbors went down and kept them from coming in. There's only one entryway there, they could stop them.They all run up to our building. Mamma immediately starts closing the windows,afraid that they might throw stones. They have stones and they break the windows, all of them. There are very many people. We have a large courtyard, and it's packed with people. They spill up to the first floor so they don't crush each other. They crawl up on trees, posts, and garages. It's just a hugecloud of people. They break and burn the motorcycle of the Armenian Sergey Sargisian, from our building. We close the windows and immediately hear tramping in our entryway. They come up to our fifth floor with a tremendous din and roar. It's incomprehensible. Mamma told me later that they were shouting Father's name, ""Grisha, open the door, we've come to kill you!,"" orsomething like that. I don't remember that, I was spaced out, kind of. Mamma says, ""Into the bedroom, quickly!"" In the bedroom we have two tall beds, part of our dowry; Mamma says, ""Hide there, they probably won't come in there, they'll ask something, say something, and leave."" She says, ""We'll tell them that we live alone here."" I can't imagine that my parents will stand out in the hall alone talking with some sort of beasts . . . I go to them and say that I'll stand together with them, I'll talk with them if they come, maybe I can find a common language with them, all the more so if they know me: I speak Azerbaijani more or less, and I can find out what they want. I told Marina andLyuda to hide under the bed, and my sister Lyuda, I can't remember if I told her anything or not.Then . . . they open the door: it's like they blew on it and it broke and fellright into the hall. The crows bursts in and starts to shout: Get out of here,leave, vacate the apartment and go back to your Armenia; things like that. Itell them, ""What has happened, speak calmly. One of you, tell me, calmly, whathas happened."" In Azerbaijani, they say, ""Get out of the apartment, leave."" I say, ""OK. Go downstairs. We'll gather everything we need and leave the apartment."" I realize that it is senseless to discuss any sort of rights withthem, these are animals. They must be stopped. The ones standing in thedoorway, the young guys, say, ""There are old people and one girl with them.Too bad!"" They take two or three steps back. It seems as though I havepacified them with our exchange. Then someone in the courtyard shouts, commanding them: ""Don't you understand what you are saying? Kill them?""And that was it! That was all it took. They grab Papa, carry him into oneroom, and Mamma and me into another. They put Mamma on the bed and start undressing her, beating her legs. They start tearing my clothes, right there, in front of Mamma. I don't remember where they went, what they did, or how much time passed. I had the feeling that they beat me on the head, on my body,and tore my clothes, all at the same time, I don't even know what I said. The atrocities started. I was savagely raped in that room. They argued among themselves who would go first.Later, I remember, I came to. I don't know if I'm dead or alive. Someone comesin, someone tall, I think, clean-shaven, in an Eskimo dogskin coat, balding. He looks around at what's happening. At that instant everything stops. It seems to me that he is either their commander or . . . that somehow everythingdepends on him. He looks and says, ""Well, we're done here."" They are beatingMamma on the head. They break up the chairs and beat her with the chair legs . . . She loses consciousness, and they decide that she's dead. Papa . . . wasout cold. They want to throw Lyuda off the balcony, but they can't get the window open. Apparently the window frames are stuck after the rain and the windows can't be opened. They leave her next to the window. She was thinking about being thrown out the window and passed out. She's not a real strong person anyway . . . He looks at me and sees that I'm saying something, thatI'm still twitching. Well, I start saying the opposite of what I should be, which is humbling myself and pleading. I start shouting, cursing . . . they don't get any entreaty out of me. I  already know that I'm dead, why would I humble myself before anyone? And he says that if that's what I think, since mytongue is so long . . . maybe he thinks that I still look quite appealing . . . In short, he commands that I be taken outside.I no longer saw or remembered what was happening to Marina and Lyuda, I don't know if they are alive or not. They take me outside. They are dragging me by my arms, by my legs. They are hitting me against the wall, the railings, something metal . . . While they are carrying me someone is biting me, someoneelse is pinching me . . .I don't even know. I think, my God, when will death come? If only it were sooner . . . Then . . . they carry me out, throw me nearthe entryway . . . and start kicking me. I lose consciousness . . . What happened after that, how many people there were, I don't remember. I come to after a while, I don't remember how long. A neighbor is bringing me clothing. I'm entirely covered with blood, she puts a dress on me. I remember that I said the same words over and over again: ""Mamma, what happened, Mamma, what have they done to us, where are we, whose house are we at?"" I can't make sense out of anything. There is a guy standing over me, I sort of know him, heserved in Afghanistan, his name is Igor, he brought me indoors. When they all went to the third entryway and killed a person there, Igor gathered his courage, took me into his arms, and brought me to the neighbors', even though he's small-minded, he put himself at risk. Igor Agayev is Azerbaijani; he served in Afghanistan. There are three brothers. The older brother also servedthere, I think; now he's stationed here, on the border, in Armenia. Igor brought me to the neighbors', and then helped me come to my senses, saying, ""Karina, I know you, calm down, I'm not one of them."" How do I know who's who and what's what? I come to, and they clean me up. I was covered in blood. ThenPapa . . . I saw Papa, I saw Mamma. And Marina, too . . . Igor was there when they dragged Marina and Lyuda out from under the bed . . . Marina . . . Lyuda said that she was Russian, they said, we'll let you go, we aren't touching theRussians, go. And while they are dragging Marina out she decides she's going to tell them she's Azerbaijani. Igor immediately grabs Marina's and Lyuda's hands, because he knows Marina, and knows that she is Armenian and is our sister, and takes her to the second floor to a neighbor's and starts pounding on the door so she will open up. She opens the door and Igor pushes them in there. So they survived.My sister Lyuda lost consciousness after the bandits started stealing things.While they were going downstairs, taking things downstairs, then coming back up again, Lyuda seized the opportunity and crawled under the bed and stayed there. Then, when she was herself again, she found a torn night shirt and put it on, and some sort of robe and went to a neighbor's on the fourth floor, theone whose apartment I had watched the crowd from, the friend of ours, and knocked on the door. The neighbor opened and said, ""I'm not going to let you in the apartment because I'm afraid of them. But I'll give you some stockings and we'll leave the building."" Lyuda says, ""I'll stay at your place because ofwhat's going on, they keep going up and down the stairs."" It was just for a moment, just a moment in life, but the neighbor wouldn't consent. Lyuda came back to our place and lay under the bed . . .I came to. Mother was there. I can't remember my supervisor's telephone number, but something had to be done. Somehow I remembered and called, and he came to get us. He didn't have any idea what was going on. He thought we were simply afraid, he didn't know that they were killing us and that we had passedbetween life and death. He came and got us and took us to the police precinct.There they looked us over. I was having trouble walking, my lungs hurt badly, it was hard to breathe . . .My supervisor's name is Urshan Feyruzovich Mamedov. He's the head of our administration. They took us there. When we were leaving, I saw a great numberof buses full of soldiers at the entrance to town. The buses were ordinary passenger buses. There were very many soldiers. We left around eleven, right after eleven. If these people could stop what was happening they could save a great many lives . . . Because the crowd was moving on, toward the school, andwhat was going on there . . . I think everyone know not only in Sumgait, not only in Yerevan. Because there they murdered them all one after the next, without stopping. After us.I think 14 people died in Microdistrict No. 3, and 10 to 12 of them were fromBuildings 4, 5, and 6. In our building one person died, and one old woman diedfrom Building 16, that's the building in front of ours. There young Azerbaijani men stopped the mob and wouldn't let it into their building. Incidentally, when we were at the neighbors', Marina called our relativesto warn them, so they would all know what was happening. I called a aunt in Microdistrict No. 5. They have three neighbors who are Armenians. I said, ""Runquickly, I can't explain what's going on; hide, do what you can, just stayalive. Hide at Azerbaijanis', ones who won't give you away."" At that moment three people came in, policemen. I think they were Azerbaijanis. I was in suchawful condition, my face was completely distorted my lips were puffed up, there was blood, my eye was swollen, no one thought I would ever see anything out of that eye again . . . my forehead was badly cut, and one-half of my facewas pushed out forward. No one would have thought that I would survive, get mynormal appearance back, and be able to grasp anything at all. I started to scream at those people, why did you come, who sent you here, no one wants you here, haven't you killed people people yet, what are you doing here? One of the soldiers said, ""Don't scream at us. We're Muslims, but we're not from the Sumgait police. They called in from Daghestan."" So at that point the Daghestan police were there.When we got to the police precinct there were an awful lot of police there,there were soldiers, police with dogs, ambulances, firemen . . . I don't know,maybe they were waiting for people to bring them the goners and the seriously injured to treat them there in the police precinct. I don't know what they were there for. There were also doctors from Baku there. They examined Lyuda and me and said, ""These women need to go to the Maternity Home, but we don't know what to do with the rest.""So they took us, and I lost contact with my parents, my boss, everyone. My boss said, ""Don't worry, I'll find you, no matter where you are, no matterwhat happens."" We went to the hospital. There we were examined by a departmenthead from the Sumgait Maternity Home, Pashayeva, I think her name was. She examined us. The ambulance was from Baku; I figured out that the Sumgait ambulances hadn't done anything, they didn't respond to any calls. People called and neither the police nor the ambulances showed any sign of life.That doctor looked me over and I could tell from her behavior that somethingvery good had happened, for she became quite glad. I even thought to myself, ""God, can it be that nothing all that bad is wrong?"" She looks me over and says, ""Now why are you suffering so? You don't know what your people have beendoing, your people did even worse things."" And I think, great, I have to deal with her . . . And I felt so bad, I thought, why don't I just die so as not tohave to hear more stuff like this from people like her? Here I am in this condition and being told about something that our people did. I just didn't have the energy to say, ""How could our people possibly be smart enough to think of something that yours haven't already done?"" I stayed there. Then theybrought in another woman, Ira B., she was married, and she was raped in her own apartment, too. There were three of us, Ira, Lyuda, and 1. The next morning they took Lyuda and Ira away. They didn't do anything to help us. Thiswas in the old Maternity Home, in the combined block. They didn't do anything more than examine me, that was it. I didn't want any shots or tranquilizer, nothing. What shots could have calmed me down? I didn't even want to look at them.I lay in the ward. Either it just worked out that way or they did it on pur-pose, but I was alone. I was alone even though the wards were packed. Thatsame evening a woman came by and asked me what was wrong with me, that my facewas disfigured. She asked what had happened to me, and I said, ""Better to ask your brother what happened, there's no point in asking me, your brother can better explain what happened."" She fell into a faint. All the doctors threw themselves at her, and the doctor categorically forbade anyone to come into myward.Then people from work came to see me, my boss, his daughter; they brought me clothing, because I was literally naked. The only thing I had on was a dress, but the woman who gave it to me was very short, and the dress was way up above my knees, and the woman orderly said, ""I can't believe you put on such ashort dress, who are you showing off your legs to here?"" I went back to my ward thinking, just one more thing from something. People from work came and brought me something in a sack, apples, I think, three or four pounds, but I couldn't take them. I had become so weak that it was just embarrassing. I saidthat I couldn't take the apples, and really didn't have any appetite. No one had to bring me anything. Some woman took the sack . . . And, oh yes! . . . Then I heard that the head doctor tell a nurse that my medical history should be hidden or torn up completely so that no one would know that I was an Armenian, maybe they wouldn't figure it out from looking at me. So they must have been thinking that there would be some kind of attack, that something else would happen. That it would be worse. Or, perhaps, someone was outside onthe street, I don't know. In any case, I didn't sleep a wink that night.The next morning they picked me up, a whole police detail, put me in a bus, and off we went. I didn't even know where they were taking me. They took me tothe club where the troops were, the very one I was in that ill-fated evening.I got off the bus. Near the City Party Committee there were a great many troops, tanks, armored personnel carriers; the whole scene was terrible. I saw a few people I knew there, and that calmed me a little. I had already thought that I was the only one left. So there were five or six of us left in Sumgait after that night. I still didn't know what happened to my parents, they didn't come to see me in the hospital, and my boss told me that everything was fine. I didn't know whether to believe him or not. Maybe he was just trying to calm me down, maybe something happened on the way. Then I went to the club and saw a lot of people I knew. They all knew one another, they were all kissing each other and asking, ""What happened, what went on?"" Two days later they came to see me from work. They were there all the time. Each day they came, showed interest, and were constantly bringing me money. They did everything they could. Of course I'm most thankful to my boss, the only one of my colleagues who didn't lose his presence of mind and who didn't change his opinions, neither before, nor after, nor in the heat of the moment, no matter what happened. He constantly took an interest. A sincere interest, from the heart . . . Then, about two days later, the secretary of the Party Committee came, not from our Party organization, but from the First Trust, which ours is part of, Comrade Kerimov, a very important figure in our town. He made arrangementswith the emergency medical personnel to take me away, because if I sat down bymyself I couldn't get up or lie down again. There was something wrong with mylungs, it was hard to breathe. They examined me there several times, there I lay were several doctors, they all thought that . . . that it must just be from all the blows, I don't know. They didn't diagnose anything in particular.When I was in the Maternity Home I even asked . . . I made it a point of insisting that they take me to the trauma section because I felt so awful. There was no way something inside wasn't broken, my ribs . . . Well they took me there and took x-rays and said that everything was fine. There were emergency medical workers on duty in the club. The mother of one of Marina's friends was there. She was the head doctor at the Sumgait Children's Clinic. They had every kind of antifever agent in the world, which was exactly what Ineeded at that moment, I thought. I said that I was having great difficultybreathing, I couldn't seem to get enough air, something was wrong with me.They put tight bandages around my chest and waist. Later I overheard somepeople saying that I had been cut all over. I think they just saw me being allbandaged up and decided that my breasts and face had been cut . . . But Iwasn't cut.They took us to the Khimik boarding house. We lived there a long time. Soon appeared representatives . . . They were agitating. At first people would not talk to them, and drove them off. One of the Armenian women shouted, ""We demand that Seidov come!"" The response was, ""It's Seidov who sent us."" Seidov is the Chairman of the Azerbaijani Council of Ministers. The woman said, ""We'll only see Seidov's daughter, have her come here, we'll do the same things to her that they did to our daughters, and then we'll deal with you agitators."" And so on. More of them said, ""Have Seidov himself come."" This went on day in, day out. The agitators kept coming and coming, this drove us out of our wits. Then people gradually started departing for Yerevan because they realized it was senseless to stay. Everything got on our nerves: The smell, the small children. There were children at the SK club, children who had literally just come out of the Maternity Home. What were they doing in a club that didn't even have running water all the time? At first we had to pay to eat there. They even overcharged us, as it turned out. On the second day someone told us that they would bring us food for free. The children were ill.Everything stank there. Well imagine about 3,000 people in a small movie theater with seating for no more than 500. You couldn't sit or lie down, it was impossible to even move. The stench was awful. Even the smallest infants took ill overnight there. I heard that they were arriving seriously ill in Yerevan, the infants. They have to be washed, they have to be bathed, not to mention that we, the adults, were ill and needed care. People were fainting right and left. I just don't know, everyone was crying, everyone . . . Only the young people, the men, somehow managed to keep it together. But the women were in a constant state of panic. It seemed to everyone that they would come any minute and kill and stab. It seemed clear that we had been gathered together purposely, like during the war, so that they could burn the movie theater and there wouldn't be a single Armenian left. Then people went up to the attic. I didn't see them, I only heard them, because I was lying down and couldn't get up. I lay right on the stage, we had some room there. Apparently they caught two people with either oil or gas. I think they wanted to burn thetheater. Maybe someone saw them, I didn't. I was in no condition to open my eyes.Everyone was suspicious of everyone else. They would ask, ""Aren't you an Azerbaijani? I think I saw you somewhere, I think you're an Azerbaijani."" Theyled out all the men and started letting them back in by checking theirpassports, relatives might be covering for each other. Half of the people didnot have any documents. There were people who had run out of their homes in nothing but a pair of pants and slippers, or wearing just a shirt, not likethey should have, with their IDs.So on the 28th, on Sunday, I think, the police did nothing to help us. OnMonday everything resumed where it had left off on Block 41A. They didn't spare a soul there: not children, not pregnant women, nobody. They killed,they burned, they hacked with axes, just everything possible. They murdered the Melkumian family whom I knew, my mother worked with them. Their daughter-in-law went to school with my older sister. They were brutally murdered. Only the two daughters-in-law survived. By a miracle one was able to save herself, she ran away, the neighbors wouldn't take her in, so she ran about the building until she found refuge. She was pregnant and had two small children. This all continued on Monday in Block 41A, on the 29th, when the troops were already in the city.They murdered people, they overturned automobiles, and they burned entire families. They say they didn't even know for sure if the people were Armeniansor not. I heard that the Lezgins suffered, too. I'm not sure myself, I didn't see any Lezgins who had been injured. They burned cars so it's very difficult now to say exactly who died and who didn't. It was very difficult to identify the corpses, or rather, what remained of the corpses after they were doused ingasoline and burned . . . it's all very hard to imagine, of course I heard that many people disappeared without a trace, from the BTZ plant two people, including a woman who worked the night shift, Aunt Razmella, who also lived inMicrodistrict 3.They were stopping buses between Baku and Sumgait. In the evening people who had been visiting Baku were returning to Sumgait, and people from Baku were going home from Sumgait, and there were students, too. They were simply savagely murdered. They were stopping the buses, the drivers immediately did what they were told because there was just no other way to deal with that hoard of brutally minded people. They stopped the buses, dragged the Armeniansout and killed them on the spot. I didn't see it myself, but I heard that theyput them all in a pile so as to burn them. Later it was hard to discern from the corpses, well you can't call them corpses, you had to figure out from the ashes who it was. l heard that two fellows saved two women, one a student, IraG., if I'm not mistaken. She was in the hospital a long time after that, and she still can't figure out who saved her. She was also brutally raped and beaten and thrown onto a pile of corpses. The fellow pulled her out of that whole pile of corpses, put his coat on her, took her into his arms, and carried her to the city. I still can't imagine how he managed to do that.I heard that from Engels Grigorian. He knows her, apparently. Well a lot of people went to that hospital anyway. She was in the hospital and singing a song in Armenian, and they wrote the words down, and, I think he still has that piece of paper, because he says that a lot of people now have that song, the one she sang in the hospital where she lay in such bad shape. They couldn't find the guy who saved her. He left her in someone's apartment andcalled the ambulance, she was in such awful shape that, probably, like me,she couldn't remember anyone's face.I think that I knew one of the people who broke into our house, maybe I had talked with him once. But I received so many blows everything was just knockedout of my head. I can't remember to this day who he was. Then, it seems, I sawthe Secretary of the Directorate's Party organization, where Marina works. Shegoes to school and works, she goes to night school at AZI, and works by day atthe Khimzashchita Construction and Installation Administration. I'm the Secretary of the Komsomol organization at our administration and often met with the secretaries of Party and Komsomol organizations. We had joint meetings. I know them all, I've even talked with them, and he, I know, is fromArmenia. An Azerbaijani, but from Armenia. It became obvious that many of those people were Azerbaijanis born in Armenia.They took me to various police stations, to the police precinct, and to theProcuracy, because the USSR Procuracy got involved in the case, and I iden-tified the photographs of people who I could more or less recognize. Theyshowed me the people who were in our apartment, they're working on ourcase, but I can't even recognize them, although it was proved that they werethe ones, they're processing it somehow. They tell me that they know thatsomeone held me by the arm and someone else held me by the leg when they were dragging me. There was someone else in our apartment who did not even touch me, he just stole a blanket and an earring or something like that. All these people, all of them, as much as I've heard about them and seen them, they wereall from Kafan.The Secretary of the Party organization is named Najaf, Najaf Rzayev. He was there when everything started. It must have been him because I didn't recognize anyone else in the crowd whom I knew besides him. All the more sinceI told him, ""Listen, you do something, because you know me."" He turned away and went toward the bedroom, where Marina was. Well you couldn't see Marina anyway. There was such a noisy confusion of people that you couldn't make out anyone. All of it flew right out of my head, and then gradually I became myself again, at the City Party Committee . . . There were military people there. I told them what went on, and they wrote it all down. I told them his name. On March 8 the Secretary of our First Trust Party organization, the one we're part of, came to see us, his name is Najaf Rzayev. I tell Mamma, ""Ifhe's here despite the fact that I gave his name, it means that either his alibi has been confirmed or, probably, that they think I'm crazy, not responsible for my words."" He said, ""What did they do to you, how awful, myself, I hid an Armenian family."" Then after some time goes by he comes back again and says something entirely different: ""I wasn't at home, my family and I went to Baku."" I said, ""Marina, what is he saying? He said something totallydifferent before."" After that I didn't go to see our Procurator, our case is being handled by a procurator from Voronezh, Fedorov by name. Fedorov told me that Rzayev's case had just gotten to him, and there were so names involved. What are they doing with Rzayev?Did he prove his alibi or not? They just think that since I was hit in the head I can't say anything for sure, whether it was him or not. It will be an insult if he was in our apartment and doesn't have to pay for it, but at the same timeI'm afraid to say I'm a hundred percent sure that it was he. Because no mat-ter who I name, they tell me, no, you're wrong, he didn't do that, that onewasn't there. All the faces have gotten mixed up in my mind. Who did whatexactly I can't say.                                                     When they took me outside there was a whole crowd there, but I didn't see it, because I had my eyes closed all the time. It seemed to me that I always gotit because of my eyes, people were always hassling me, for some reason it always seemed to me that my eyes are responsible. When they were beating my face I thought they were trying to put my eyes out. So I had my eyes closed, they took me outside and started to beat me. A young guy, 22, held my arms, heworks at the BTZ plant. And right nearby, across the road from us, Block 41, is where all this was going on. Right across the road from us. The BTZ dormitory is over there, that's where he lives. Now he's in custody, they evenhave proved, as far as I know, that it was he who killed Shurik Gambarian, theclarinet player from the third entryway of our building. One person in our building was killed, it was that man.A guy comes by who shared a room with the guy who was holding me. He saw thathe was holding me by the arms and that he was beating me, but he didn't come over, he just looked and then went into the dormitory. A while after it was all over, people started making announcements in town saying that investigators had been summoned. That guy went and told them everything. Now they've caught him, everything's been proved. Now, evidently, they've beenbeating him, I don't know what they're doing with them over there, but he himself said that he was working the night shift at the plant. Some young guy came to the plant and said, ""Everyone who wants to kill Armenians come to the bus station on Saturday at ten."" That was it. He said, the ones who wanted to,went. This was at the BTZ plant, during the night shift, probably, late Fridaynight. It was at night, they were at the sauna together. And he said, what do you mean, do you understand what you are saying? The others were silent, probably, in their hearts they were thinking, I'm going to go. But they didn'tsay anything to one another. He said that he thought it important to to go, because he had heard a lot about what had happened in Kafan, that they had killed their Azerbaijani sisters, their mothers, burned villages, and all of that. That guy was also born in Kafan. That is certain. And Marina says that the Secretary of the Party organization is from Armenia, too.                                                             fromI've participated in the investigation a couple of times. I'm satisfied withthem thus far. They summoned us and asked about what happened, and every word I said was recorded. I met some guy there . . . By the way, he was an Armenian. I said that he was in our apartment, but what he did, I don't know. His last name was Grigorian, Eduard Grigorian. He s from Sumgait, from Microdistrict 1. He was sentenced I think, to five years, not his first time. His mother is Russian. I met with him at the KGB in Baku, at the Azerbaijani KGB. They took us there and showed me photographs. There were so many photographs, I think they even photographed those people who were caught at curfew, and I've got them all confused. I say, the face was about like this, the guy in the white coat with the red clasps. But he could take that coat offand burn it somewhere, and it would be like looking for a needle in a haystack. Well. This guy, Grigorian, I said, he was in our apartment, but he is so light-complected that he looks like a Lezgin. I don't know what he did, I can't remember. Maybe he beat me or raped me. But he was in our apartment. At the KGB he started asking me, pleading with me, there's no need for this, all this stuff, look me in the eyes, you're like a sister to me. I took a lookat him and thought, ""My God, Heaven forbid that I should have a brother like you."" But they were satisfied with my responses, because I said everything without great certainty. I was there with Mamma. Then Lyuda came in, but when she came in she got sick immediately. She wanted to kill him, she crawled overthe table at him. She recognized him. When she came to, Lyuda was lying on thebalcony, the mob threw her there and all of them ran into the bedroom. We had all kinds of boxes with dishes in them, the dowries for all three sisters. They stole everything in the apartment, leaving only small things. At that moment Lyuda came to and started remembering everything. Well, seeing the faces, hearing the voices . . . Two people were saying they could burn the apartment. Another says, why burn the apartment when I've got three kids and no place to live. So this guy was in temporary housing, he didn't have anywhere to live, he was from Sumgait. They were sure that they would get the apartment. Besides, the neighbors were Azerbaijani. Why should they burn the apartment, they might burn Azerbaijanis. That's what they said. How did they know there were Azerbaijanis there, if they just picked a place, thinking thatArmenians lived there? We have a list of the residents for our part of the building, our name is in there, but how could they know that Azerbaijanis lived on the other side of the wall from us? So they didn't set fire to our apartment.I don't know, I was in such bad shape that if all of it had come to a halt when I was outside, if someone had asked me what was happening, I wouldhave said that a civil war was going on. Well, maybe not civil . . . butprobably civil, because when they were beating me I opened my eyes and sawthat all the neighbors were standing on their balconies and watching, like ata free horror film. So a civil war was going on, and only the Armenians werebeing fought. If it were a world war or something like that, they would havebeen fighting everyone. But they only fought us. Then I met some women from our building, some Azerbaijanis. They are crying, they tell me, ""Karina, we saw all of it, how could it happen?"" They're asking me! Well I just don't knowwhat to call it if a normal girl can stand there and watch what happened to me. I think that if it were the other way around either I wouldn't have been able to take it, or I would have tried to avert it, like that one Azerbaijani woman did in front of our building. A woman lives there, an awful, dissipated woman, if you can call her a woman, the dissipated life she leads. Two Armenian families live there, in her part of the building. She came out on thebalcony and saw what was happening to me and started to scream and curse. She came down to the entryway and said, ""You'll come in this entryway over my deadbody."" So not one of them took it in his head to go in that entryway. Some folks were saying that those people were so out of control that they didn't even know what they were doing. I don't think that's true. They knew very wellwhat they were doing if they didn't even lift a hand against that woman. They couldn't have cared less about her, but the fact that she was an Azerbaijani stopped them.They were just beasts, they had smoked so much. When they came to our place they were all chewing something. I noticed: Everyone who came into the apartment was chewing something. I think, my God, maybe I just think that? Maybe I'm losing my mind? But no, they're all chewing something. Maybe it is some kind of drug, it must be, because . . . At first glance they all seemed to be such normal people, young, clean-shaven, looking exactly as if they had come to some sort of celebration. But they were shouting something. Theydidn't talk, they shouted, as though there were deaf people there. They screamed and screamed: ""Yeah, killing, killing, we're killing the Armenians!"" Only they didn't shout ""kill,"" they shouted ""gurun ermianlary."" Gurun literally means ""kill,"" or ""destroy.""That's how it was! I'll continue. We hid in a captain's apartment, he's anAzerbaijani, his wife is a Tatar. We were sitting in their apartment, their kids were out in the yard. Their kids knew a whole lot. This was in our part of the building, on the third floor. When Mamma came to and couldn't findLyuda she took Papa's hand, this was while the looters were stealing things,but they didn't pay attention because they were stealing things. Apparentlythey had already ceased killing and switched to stealing. Mamma found thecourage to . . .A boy said to my mother ""Where's the gold?"" Mamma said he must have been 12 to 14 years old. He even looked Russian, he was so fair-skinned. But the Azerbaijanis from Armenia are fair-skinned. I noticed they were all on the fair side. He shouted, they were all smashing things, and he asks Mamma where the gold is. We kept our gold in the wardrobe with our important papers. In a little black bag, we kept everything in there. Mamma doesn't really like to wear gold. She probably never even wore those things from the time they were bought for her. They took everything that was lying on the cheval glass. Mammathinks that the gold saved us. Because they threw themselves at the gold, and Mamma grabbed Papa, who was trying to breathe. They had closed his mouth, bound his hands, and put a pillow and a chair on his face . . . They had shoved something into his mouth so he would suffocate. Mamma grabbed him and tore all that stuff off . . . He had something in his mouth, he was having trouble breathing, his nose was filled with blood. Mamma grabbed him and started running from the fifth down to the first floor because no one wanted to open their doors to them. Mamma said that by accident, completely by accident that person opened his door, he was sleeping, and said, half-awake, ""What's happened?"" He sees that they are bloody. Mamma said, ""At least go and find out what's happening to my daughters, even if they've burned them or murdered them, at least bring the corpses."" He went looking for us. At that moment Lyuda was under the bed. She says that after they left it seemed that someone was calling her name. When he quietly called her she couldn't get out from under the bed. She wanted to get out and was calling softly. She thought she was shouting, but in fact she was either silent or was only talking to herself, it just seemed to her that she was shouting. When she got out from under the bed everyone was gone. And again . . . She thought that she had losther mind. I'll never leave here, never! To hell with it! It just seems that way to me, I'll come to eventually. But then, when everything had settled down, stopped, that mall brought Lyuda down, and Igor carried me in fromoutside. Or first I was brought in, then Lyuda, I don't remember what order ithappened in.And Mamma said, ""Listen, they're all running around down there, shouting something or other, and running toward the other building."" It had more or less calmed down where we were. Who's dead, who's alive, we don't know. I tried to call my girlfriend. I had basically come to. Mamma says, ""Listen;let's go upstairs, at least get a mattress or something. We don't know how long we'll be here. Maybe they didn't burn everything."" I don't get it, allwomen have that feeling, they want to get something from their homes, maybe not everything was taken? I tell Mamma, ""Mamma, what do you need any of that for? To hell with it! We're alive, forget the rest of it, all of it!"" Shesays, ""No, let's go get at least something. Maybe we'll leave here, spend the night at someone else's."" Mamma went upstairs, and their little boy, their sonAlik, was standing on the lookout. lIe was standing there to see if they were coming. They only managed to run up there and grab something one time. He shouts, ""Come back, they're coming!"" They didn't have enough time to get a lot, mattresses from one apartment, a blanket from another . . . Mamma got my knitting . . . Someone managed to grab our old things, the ones we never wore,out of the hall . . . Someone took Father's old coveralls. The neighbor, his wife, Mamma and Papa . . . Marina went with them. I was in no condition to leave. Neither was Lyuda. We just sat. They ran out and we closed the door andjust then we hear that the mob is on its way toward our place upstairs, they're dragging something again. They were going toward the other building, maybe over by the school, or . . . There was an unfinished building overthere, people said they were going toward the basement or the unfinished building, they could gradually carry everything over there. Then things more or less calmed down. I tried to call my boss.Later there was more noise. We were on the third floor, in a one-bedroomapartment, and a woman lives in the one-bedroom place on the second floor,Asya Dallakian. She's an old woman, retired. She wasn't at home, at thattime she was usually in the country, she has a married daughter there, andher grandson is in the army. She is only very rarely in town; she gets herretirement money and the apartment is essentially vacant. They startedpounding on her door and broke it down. She had two or three beds in there, something like that, she's a 60-to 70-year-old woman who really does not even live there. Probably she had some pots, a couple of metal bed frames and mattresses, and a television. When her grandson came she bought a television. They started wrecking everything. I started getting sick again. I think, ""My God, what is going on around here? When will this end?"" We turned off the lights and sat. As it turns out the people who weren't afraid, the ones who knew what was going on, knew not to turn off the lights. We didn't know, but they didn't come to where we were all the same. They all knew very well that he was a captain. He went out and closed the door, and we sat in his apartment. His last name was Kasumov. He's an exserviceman, retired, works up at the fire station at some plant or other. He went out and stood at his door.They tell him, ""Comrade Captain, don't worry, we won't harm you, you're one ofus."" He went upstairs, and they say, ""Aren't you taking anything from this apartment?"" He says, ""I don't need anything."" And the women who were standing in the yard . . . we have a basement, full of water . . . the women who were standing in the yard saw. Those guys, they left everything they stole on the first floor and ran upstairs again. The women threw everything they had time to into the basement, to save our property. Some things were left: dirty pillows, two or three other things and a rug. A guy came downstairs, really mad, and he says, ""Where's the rug? I just put it right here!"" They tell him, ""Some guy came and took it and went off toward the school."" He ran off in thatdirection.Oh! I forgot the most important point. When Igor picked me up in his arms, there were women standing there who saw everything that was going on. They just didn't tell me about it for a long time. The wife of that military man, she didn't want to kill my spirit, I was already dead enough. Later she told me, that after they murdered Uncle Shurik in the third entryway one of them, the ringleader, apparently a young man, said, ""Where's the girl who was here?""And he became furious. The woman tells him, ""She came to . . . "" She didn'tknow what to say: Think something up? Someone carried her off? Then they wouldcomb the whole house and find me and our whole family. So the woman says, ""Shecame to and went to the basement."" Now, our basement is full of water. So the whole mob dashes off to the basement to look for me or my corpse. They took flashlights; they were up to their waists in water, water which had been standing there for years, and soot, and fuel oil. They climbed down in there to get me. Then one of them said, ""There's so much water down there, she probably walked and walked and then passed out and died. She met her death in the basement. That's it, we can leave, no problem!"" I didn't know that, and when I was told, I felt worse. Two times worse. A lot worse! So they didn't just want to pound me flat, something more awful was awaiting me . . .After that we of course didn't want to live in Sumgait any longer. We really didn't want to go back to our apartment. When we moved, I went up there and started to quiver and shake all over, because I started remembering it all. Although the neighbors all sobbed, it was all . . . so cheap . . . The people who sat in their apartments and didn't help us at a time like that. I think that they could have helped! I don't think that they were obligated to, but they could have helped us! Because that one woman was able to stop that whole brutal crowd by herself. That means they could have, too. It would have beenenough foe one man or women to say, What do you think you're doing?"" That's all! That would have done it. There were 60 apartments in our building. Not one person said it! When I was lying on the ground and all those people were standing on their balconies I didn't hear anyone's voice, no one said what areyou doing, leave her alone . . . Mamma even told one of the neighbor women that if it had been an Azerbaijani woman in my place they would have dropped abomb if it would have killed even one Armenian. They would have stood up for one of their own. True, they say that our neighbor from the fourth entryway, an old/ sick woman tried to stop the pogrom. The Azerbaijanis have a custom: if a woman takes her scarf and throws it on the ground, the men are supposed to stop immediately. The old woman from the fourth entryway did that, but theystomped her scarf into the ground, pushed her off to the side, and said, ""Ifyou want to go on living, you'll disappear into your apartment."" So she left.That trick didn't work on them.Even the neighbors who helped us move told me, OK, fine, calm down, forget that it happened. I said I'd only forget it if I told them right then that ithad happened to their daughter--and if that didn't have any effect on them, then I would forget everything, too. Imagine that it happened to your sister. And no one did anything. Anything.

"From: fortmann@superbowl.und.ac.za (Paul Fortmann - PG)Subject: Praying for JusticeI recently came across this article which I found interesting. I have posted it to hear what other people feel about the issue.I realise it is rather long (12 pages in Wordperfect) by may well be worth the read.Except for the first page (which I typed) the rest was scanned inusing Omnipage. Some of the f's have come out as t's and visa-versa. I have tried to correct as much as possible.ABOUT THE AUTHORPeter Hammond is the founder of Frontline Fellowship, amissionary organisation witnessing to the communist countries inSouthern Africa. He has also made several visits to many EastEuropean countries.FRONTLINE FELLOWSHIP NEWS                          ISSN 1018-144XPRAYING FOR JUSTICE(by Peter Hammond)To those involved in ministering to Christians sufferingpersecution the imprecatory Psalms are a tremendous source ofcomfort. And those of us who are fighting for the right to lifeof the preborn, or battling social evils such as pornography orcrime, are beginning to appreciate what an important weapon Godhas entrusted to us in the imprecatory Psalms.THE IMPRECATORY PSALMSEarly in my Christian walk I encountered the prayers forjudgement in the Psalms and was quite at loss to know how torespond to them. Prayers such as:""Break the arm of the wicked and evil men; call him to account forhis wickedness ..."" Psalm 10:15 did not seem consistent with thegospel of love which I had accepted. Yet Psalm 10:15 was clearlymotivated by love for God (""The Lord is King for ever and ever;the nation will perish from His land"" 10:16, and ""Why does thewicked man revile God? 10:13), and by love for the innocent whosuffer (""You hear, O Lord, the desire of the afflicted; Youencourage them, and You listen to their cry, defending thefatherless and oppressed, in order that man, who is of the earth,may terrify no more."" 10:17-18)Nevertheless, I grew increasingly uncomfortable reading suchgraphic prayers for God to judge the wicked as: ""Pour out yourwrath on them; let Your fierce anger overtake them"" 64:24; ""OLord, the God avenges, O God who avenges, shine forth. Rise up, OJudge of the earth, pay back to the proud what they deserve.""95:1-2; ""Break the teeth in their mouths, O God; ...let themvanish like water .. let their arrows be blunted ... Therighteous will be glad when they are avenged, when they bathetheir feet in the blood of the wicked. Then men will way, ""Surelythe righteous still are rewarded; surely there is a God whojudges the earth.'"" 58:6-11Certainly I wanted God to be honoured and yes I was deeplydestressed by the prevalence of evil -  but could I actually prayfor God to ""pour out His wrath"" on the wicked?The scripture make it clear that these prayers are not to beprayed for own selfish motives, nor against our personal enemies.Rather they are to be prayed in Christ, for His glory and againstHis enemies. The psalmist describes the targets of theseimprecation as: those who devise injustice in their heart andwhose hands mete out violence (58:2) those who ""boast of evil""and ""are a disgrace in the eyes of God. Your tongue plotsdestruction, it is like a sharpened razor, and you who practisedeceit. You love evil rather than good, falsehood rather thanspeaking the truth."" 52:1-3; ""They crush your people ... Theyslay the widow and the alien; they murder the fatherless."" 94:5-6; ""With cunning they conspire against Your people; they plotagainst those You cherish."" 83:3; ""You hate all who do wrong. Youdestroy those who tell lies; bloodthirsty and deceitful men theLord abhors."" 5:5-6.To those unrepentant enemies of God the psalmist declares:""Surely God will bring you down to everlasting ruin"" 52:5;""Surely God will crush the heads of His enemies ... of those whogo on in their sins"" 68:21.And the purpose of these prayers for justice is declared: ""Thenit will be known to the ends of the earth that God rules ...""59:13; ""to proclaim the powers of God"" 68:34; ""All kings will bowdown to Him and all nations will serve Him "" 72:11; ""Who knowsthe power of Your anger? For Your wrath is as great as the fearthat is due You. "" 90:11Yet despite the fact that 90 of the 150 Psalms includeimprecations (prayers invoking God's righteous judgement upon thewicked) such prayers are rare in the average Western church.However, amongst the persecuted churches these prayers are muchmore common.PRAYING AGAINST THE PERSECUTORSAmidst the burnt out churches and devastation of Marxist Angola Ifound the survivors of communist persecution including thecrippled and maimed, and widows and orphans praying for God tostrike down the wicked and remove the persecutors of the Church.I was shocked - yet it was Biblical (Even the martyrs in heavenpray ""How long, Sovereign Lord, holy and true, until you judgethe inhabitants of the earth and avenge our blood?"" Revelation6:10).The initiator of the communist persecution in Angola was AgestinoNeto. Described as a ""drunken, psychotic, marxist poet"", Neto hadbeen installed by Cuban troops as the first dictator of Angola.He boasted that: ""Within 20 years there won't be a Bible or achurch left in Angola. I will have eradicated Christianity."" Yetdespite the vicious wave of church burning and massacres it isnot Christianity that was eradicated in Angola but Agestino Neto.Neto died in mysterious circumstances on an operating table inMoscow.In Romania I learnt of a series of remarkable incidents recordedof God judging the persecutors of the Church in answer to prayer:  *  A communist official ordered a certain pastor to be     arrested. the next day the official died of a heart attack.  *  Another communist party official ordered that all the Bibles     in his district were to be collected and pulped, to be     turned into toilet paper. This blasphemous project was in     fact carried out. But the next day when the official was     medically examined, he was informed that he had terminal     cancer. He died shortly afterwards.  *  On another occasion, a communist official who had ordered a     Baptist church to be demolished by bulldozers died in a car     crash the very next day.  *  When an order was given to dismantle a place of worship on     the mountainside in a forest, the workmen flatly refused to     carry out the order. At gunpoint a group of conscripted     gypsies also refused to touch the church. In desperation,     the communist police forced prisoners at bayonet-point to     dismantle the structure. Yet the officer in charge pleaded     with the local Christians to pray for him, that God would     not judge him. He emphasised that he had nothing against     Christians and was only obeying strict orders. The building     was in fact reconstructed later, and again used for worship.     ""They were all seized with Sear and the Name of the Lord     Jesus was held in high honour... in this way the Word of the     Lord spread widely and grew in power. "" Acts 19:17,20Nicolae Ceaucescu the dictator who ordered much of thepersecution in Romania was overthrown by his own army andexecuted on Christmas day, 1989, to joyous shouts of ""theantiChrist is dead"" in the streets. Many testified that this wasin answer to the fervent prayers of the long suffering people ofRomania.Another persecutor of the Church who challenged God was SamoraMachel, the first dictator of Marxist Mozambique. Samora Machelwas a cannibal who ate human flesh in witchcraft ceremonies inthe 1960's. He pledged his soul to Satan and vowed that he woulddestroy the Church and turn Mozambique into the first trulyMarxist-Leninist state in Africa. Thousands of churches inMozambique were closed confiscated, ""nationalised"" chained andpadlocked, burnt down or boarded up. Missionaries were expelled,some being imprisoned first. Evangelism was forbidden. Bibleswere ceremonially burnt and tens of thousands of Christians,including many pastors and elders, were shipped off toconcentration camps - most were never seen again.A month before his sudden death Samora Machel cursed God publiclyand challenged Him to prove His existence by striking him(Machel) dead. On 19 October 1986, while several churches werespecifically praying for God to stop the persecution inMozambique, Machel's Soviet Tupelov aircraft crashed in a violentthunderstorm. The plane crashed 200 metres within South Africa'sboundary with Mozambique. Amidst the wreckage the marxist plansfor overthrowing the government of Malawi were discovered andpublished. Not only had God judged a blasphemer and a persecutor,but He had also saved a country from persecution.In the months leading up to the first multi-party elections inZambia many churches fasted and prayed tor God to remove the 27year socialist dictatorship of Kenneth Kaunda. This was done on31st October 1991 when Fredrick Chiluba (a man converted toChrist whilst imprisoned for opposing Kaunda) was electedpresident of Zambia and covenanted to make Zambia a Christiancountry.It is recorded in history that the wicked Mary, Queen of Scots,declared trembling and in tears: ""I am more afraid of John Knox'sprayers than of an army of ten thousand"".On 3 April 1993 the Secretary General of the South AfricanCommunist Party Chris Hani was shot dead. From the unprecedentedinternational wave of condolences and adulation reported onecould be forgiven for assuming that this man was a saint and amartyr. Certainly it was not the death and resurrection of ChristJesus which dominated the thoughts and headlines of South Africathis Easter, but the assassination of Chris Hani.The stunning hypocrisy of the situation is that 20 135 peoplewere murdered in South Africa in 1992, yet more collectiveconcern and anguish were reported over the death of the head ofthe SA Communist Party than for all the thousands of othervictims. Indeed the SA government, the international communityand the mass media have apparently had greater sorrow reportedover this one death than for all the 50 000 South Africansmurdered since 2nd February 1990 when the ANC, SACP and PAC wereunbanned!Yet as a member of the ANC Revolutionary Council since 1973,Deputy Commander of Umkhonto we Sizwe (MK) the ANC's ""militarywing"" - from 1982, and Chief of Staff of MK from 1987, Chris Hanihad approved and ordered bombings and assassinations of manyunarmed civilians. As Jesus warned: ""all who live by the swordwill die by the sword "" Matt 26:52.After personally confronting Hani about his terrorist activitiesat a press conference in Washington DC (where he publiclydeclared his support for Fidel Castro, Col. Gaddafi, YasserArafat and Saddam Hussein and defended the placing of car bombsand limpet mines in public places during ""the struggle"") I toldhim that I was a Christian and, while I didn't hate him, I didhate communism and I was praying for him - that God would eitherbring him to repentance and salvation in Christ, or that Godwould remove him. He responded by swearing and declaring that hewas an atheist.Several other people also prayed that God would either bring Hanito repentance or remove him. Similarly several churches inAmerica have begun to pray the imprecatory Psalms againstunrepentant abortionists. In one town 8 abortionists were struckdown, with heart attacks, strokes, car accidents and cancer,within months of these public prayers for God to stop thesekillers of preborn babies.Some praised God for His righteous acts of judgement and quoted:""When justice is done, it brings joy to the righteous and terrorto evildoers "" Proverbs 21:15. Others were shocked that anyChristian could express satisfaction at the misfortune of any -even of the blatantly wicked. Yet the Apostles prayed imprecatoryprayers (Acts 13:8-12; Galatians 1:8-9; 2 Tim 4:14-15) and so didour Lord (Matt 11:20-24).What then should our attitude towards the imprecatory Psalms be?Should we be praying the Psalms? To tackle these thorny issues Iwould like to present a short summary of an excellent book, ""WarPsalms of the Prince of Peace - Lessons From The ImprecatoryPsalms"" by James E Adams, (published by the Presbyterian andReformed Publishing Company):Our Lord Jesus Christ & His apostles used the Psalms constantlyin teaching men to know God. The New Testament (NT) quotes theOld Testament (OT) over 283 times. 41% of all OT quotes in the NTare from the Psalms. Christ Himself alluded to the Psalms over 50times. The Psalms are the Prayer Book of the Bible.1. Are the imprecatory Psalms the oracles of God?Some Christian commentators & theologians reject these Psalms as""devilish"", ""diabolical "", ""unsuited to the church"", and ""Not God's pronouncements of His wrath on the wicked; but the prayers ofa man for vengeance on his enemies, just the opposite of Jesus'teaching that we should love our enemies. ""Yet 2 Tim 3:16-17 declares:""All Scripture is God breathed and is useful for teaching,rebuking, correcting and training in righteousness, so that theman of God may be thoroughly equipped for every good work. ""(see also 2 Peter 3:15-16).The fact that something in the Word of God is beyond ourcomprehension is not grounds to denying or even questioning itsinspiration. To make ourselves the judge of what is good or evilis to impudently take the place of God.Do we imagine ourselves to be holier than God? Wrong ideas of Godhave led many to become ""evangelic plastic surgeons who have madeit their job to ""clean up"" God's Word according to their ownideas of what is proper. They have forgotten that it is God alonewho must determine what Christianity is and what is suitable forHis Church. The essence of what many have done is to question theauthority of God's Word (like Eve's original sin of listening toSatan's question ""Yes, hath God said... ?"").The Psalms are part of God's revelation of Himself and Hisattributes, and they are reaffirmed by the NT as theauthoritative Word of God. Those imprecatory Psalms which theseevangelical plastic surgeons reject as ""unsuited"" and ""unworthy""for the Church are the very Psalms Christ used to testify aboutHimself (eg: Mark 12:36; Matt 22:43-44) and which the Apostlesused as authoritative Scripture (eg: Acts 1:16-20; Acts 4:25; Heb4:7). See also: 2 Samuel 23:1-2.CH Spurgeon said concerning the imprecatory Psalms, (especiallyPs 109):""Truly this is one of the hard places of Scripture, a passagewhich the soul trembles to read, yet it is not ours to sit injudgement upon it, but to bow our ear to what the Lord wouldspeak to us therein. ""The rejection of any part of God's Word is a rejection of thegiver of that Word, God Himself.2. Who is praying these Psalms?Christ quoted the Psalms not merely as prophesy; He actuallyspoke the Psalms as His own words. The Psalms occupied anenormous place in the life of our Lord. He used it as His prayerbook and song book - from the Synagogue to the festivals and atthe Last Supper.On the cross Christ quoted from the Psalms - not as some ancientauthority that He adapted for His own use, but as His very ownwords - the words of the Lord's Anointed - which as David's SonHe truly was.""Father, into your hands I commit my Spirit"" Ps 31:5""My God, My God, why have you forsaken me?"" Ps 22:1In His ministry Christ foretells what He will say as the Judge onthe day of judgement, and He quotes the Psalms in doing so!Matt 7:23 ""Then I will tell them plainly, 'I never knew you. Awayfrom me, you evildoers'. "" Ps 6:8In Heb 10:5 the apostle attributes Ps 40:6-8 directly to Christalthough nowhere in the Gospels is Christ recorded as having saidthese words. Similarly Hebrews 2 : 12 attributes Ps 22:22directly to Christ despite there being no record of His havingspoken these words while on earth. Clearly the apostles believedChrist is speaking in the Psalms.Christ came to establish His kingdom and to extend His mercy inall the earth. But let us never forget that Jesus will come againto execute Judgement on the wicked.David as the anointed king of the chosen people of God was aprototype of Jesus Christ. Acts 2:30:""being therefore a prophet, ... he foresaw and spoke of theresurrection of Christ. ""David was a witness to Christ in his office, in his lite, and inhis words. The same words which David spoke, the future Messiahspoke through him. The prayers of David were prayed also byChrist. Or better Christ Himself prayed these Psalms through Hisforerunner David.The imprecatory Psalms are expressions of the infinite justice ofGod, of His indignation against wrong doing, and His compassionfor the wronged.3. But what about the Psalms of repentance?Christ is also the Lamb of God, the substitutionary sacrifice forour sins. Christ in the day of His crucifixion was charged withthe sin of His people. He appropriated to Himself those debts forwhich He had made Himself responsible. Our Lord was thesubstitution for the sinner. He took the sinners place (Isaiah53).""God made Him who had no sin to be sin for us, so that in Him wemight become the righteousness of God. "" 2 Cor 5:21In history the Psalms, especially the imprecatory Psalms, havebeen understood to have been the prayers of Christ by: StAugustine, Jerome, Ambrose, Tertullian, Luther and many others.All the Psalms are the voice of Christ. Christ is praying theimprecatory Psalms! All the Psalms are messianic. It is the LordJesus Christ who is praying these prayers of vengeance. It isonly right for the righteous King of Peace to ask God to destroyHis enemies.These prayers signal an alarm to all who are still enemies ofKing Jesus. His prayers will be answered! God's Word is revealedupon all who oppose Christ. Anyone who rejects God's way offorgiveness in the cross of Christ will bear the dreadful cursesof God.He who prays Psalm 69:23-28 will one day make this prayer areality when He declares to those on His left:""Depart from me you who are cursed into the eternal fire preparedfor the devil and his angels. "" Matt 25:41All the enemies of the Lord need to hear these Psalms. *God'sKingdom is at War.* The powers of evil will tall and God alonewill reign forever!""With justice He judges and makes war...out of His mouth comes asharp sword with which to strike down the nations. He will rulethem with an iron sceptre; He treads the winepress of the fury ofthe wrath of God Almighty...King of Kings and Lord of Lords. ""Rev 19 : 154. Are Jesus' prayers contradictory?What about Jesus' command to love our enemies and to bless thosewho curse us (Matt 5:44)?Christ is of course the loving and merciful Saviour who forgivessin; but He is also the awesome Judge who is coming in Judgementon those who disobey His Gospel.""God is just. He will pay back trouble to those who trouble youand give relief to you who are troubled...This will happen whenthe Lord Jesus is revealed from heaven in blazing fire with Hispowerful angels. He will punish those who do not obey the Gospelof our Lord Jesus. They will be punished with everlastingdestruction and shut out from the presence of the Lord and fromthe majesty of His power on the day He comes to be glorified inHis holy people and to be marvelled at among au those who havebelieved. "" 2 Thess 1:6-10Jesus has power on earth to forgive sins, and He has power onearth to execute judgement upon His enemies. In the Psalms we seeboth the vengeance and the love ot God.Even in the N.T. & in the Gospels we see imprecations.""Woe to you,...hypocrites...blind guides...blind fools...full ofgreed and self indulgence...whitewashed tombs...you snakes! Youbrood of vipers! How will you escape being condemned to Hell ? ""Matt 23In Matt 26:23-24 Christ quotes from Ps 69 and 109 to refer to Hisbetrayal by Judas.We also need to acknowledge that Christ's prayers of blessing arenot for all. In John 17:6-9 it is clear that Christ is onlypraying to the elect of God - those who have:""obeyed your Word""... ""accepted"" God's Word ... and have""believed "". (see Luke 10:8-16 - Those who reject themessage of God's kingdom will be judged.)5. May we pray the imprecatory Psalms?Martin Luther pointed out that when one prays: ""Hallowed be ThyName, Thy Kingdom come, Thy will be done "" then ""he must put allthe opposition to this in one pile and say: 'Curses, maledictionsand disgrace upon every other name and every other kingdom. Maythey be ruined and torn apart and may all their schemes andwisdom and plans run aground' . ""To pray tor the extension of God's kingdom is to solicit thedestruction of all other kingdoms, eg: Dan 2:44: ""The God ofheaven will set up a kingdom that will never be destroyed ... itwill crush all those kingdoms and bring them to an end, but itwill itself endure forever. ""* Advance and victory for the Church means defeat and retreat forthe kingdom of darkness. *There is a life & death struggle between two kingdoms. The Churchcannot exclude hatred tor satan's kingdom from its love for God'skingdom. God's kingdom cannot come without satan's kingdom beingdestroyed. God's will cannot be done on earth without thedestruction of evil. The glory of God demands the destruction ofevil. Instead of being influenced by a sickly sentimentalismwhich insists upon the assumed, but really non-existent, rightsof man - we should focus instead upon the rights of God.Note Psalm 83 where the Psalmist prays against those who ""plottogether"" against God and His people:""Cover their faces with shame so that men will seek your Name OLord... Do to them as You did to Midian, as you did to Sisera andJabin at the river Kishon, who perished at Endor and became likerefuse on the ground. ""The story of Sisera in the book of Judges (Chapter 4 and 5)provides a vivid example of God's judgement on the wicked. Sisera""cruelly oppressed the Israelites for twenty years"" and they""cried to the Lord for help"" Judges 4:3. In response to thoseprayers: ""The Lord routed Sisera and all his chariots and army bythe sword, and Sisera abandoned his chariot and fled on foot...All the troops of Sisera fell by the sword; not a man was left. ""Judges 4:15-16The account then goes on to describe how Sisera escaped to thetent of Jael where she lulled him into a false sense of safetyand then drove a tent peg through his temple with a hammer. Thesong of victory by Deborah and Barak celebrated the crushing ofthe head of Sisera in graphic detail (Judges 5:25-27). And it isthis that Psalm 83 implores God to again do to His enemies.. ""Asyou did to Sisera ...""6. The blessings of obedience and the curse of disobedienceThe imprecatory Psalms are fully consistent with the Law of God:     ""If you do not carefully follow all the words of this Law,     which are written in this book, and do not revere this     glorious and awesome Name - the Lord your God - the Lord     will send fearful plagues on you and your descendants. He     will bring upon you all the diseases of Egypt that you     dreaded, and they will cling to you. The Lord will also     bring on you every kind of sickness and disaster not     recorded in this Book of the Law until you are     destroyed...because you did not obey the Lord your God ...     so it will please Him to ruin and destroy you. You will be     uprooted from the land you are entering to possess. ""     Deuteronomy 28:58-63The covenant God made with His people included curses fordisobedience as well as blessings for obedience. Deuteronomy 27records the formal giving and receiving of the covenant terms inan awesome account:""The Levites shall recite to all the people of Israel in a loudvoice:""Cursed is the man who carves an image or casts an idol - a thingdetestable to the Lord, the work of the craftsman's hands - andsets it up in secret. ""Then all the people shall say, ""Amen!"" """"Cursed is the man who dishonours his father or his mother...""Cursed is the man who moves his neighbour's boundary stone...""Cursed is the man who leads the blind astray on the roads...""Cursed is the man who withholds justice from the alien, thefatherless or the widow...""Cursed is the man who kills his neighbour secretly...""Cursed is the man who accepts a bribe to kill an innocentperson.""Cursed is the man who does not uphold the words of the Law bycarrying them out.Then all the people shall say, ""Amen!"" "" Deut 27:14-26The New Testament confirms that the inevitable consequence ofrejecting Christ is the curse. ""If anyone does not love theLord - a curse be on him. "" 1 Corinthians 16:22(See also: Romans 12:19-21; Hebrews 1:1-3; 3:7-12; 3:1519; 10:26-31; 12:14-29.)7. How can we preach these prayers?The Church of Jesus Christ is an army under orders.Scripture constitutes the official dispatch from the Commander-in-Chief. But we have a problem: those who are called to pass onthose orders to others are refusing to do so. How then can weexpect to be a united, effective army? Is it any wonder that thetroops have lost sight of their commission to demolish thestrongholds of the kingdom of darkness? If the Church does nothear the battle cries of her Captain, how will she follow Himonto the battlefield?Pastors are commissioned to pass on the orders of the Church'sCommander, never withholding or changing His words. One whose jobis to carry dispatches to troops in wartime would face certainand severe punishment if he dared to amend the general's orders.The pastor's charge is of greater importance than that of acourier in any earthly army. There's no place tor the dispatcherto decide he doesn't agree with his Commander's strategy.When Jesus Christ sent seventy-two disciples on a preachingmission, He told them to proclaim the coming of God's Kingdom (Lk10:9) - that is, to announce that people must submit to God'srule in their lives. Jesus instructed them to pray for peace onany house they approach, assuring them that if anyone rejectedit, the peace would return on the disciples (verse 5). But wemust consider what He said they should do if their message wererejected - that is, if the hearers persisted in rebellion againstGod's rule - ""But when you enter a town and are not welcomed, gointo its 'streets and say, 'Even the dust of your town thatsticks to our feet we wipe off against you. Yet be sure of this:The kingdom of God is near""' Luke 10:11.What would be the result of that denunciation? I tell you, itwill be more bearable on that day for Sodom [on which God sentfire from Heaven in judgement for its wickedness] than for thattown (verse 12). Immediately Jesus added curses on Korazin,Bethsaida, and Capernaum tor their rejection of His message(verses 13-15). He then explained to the disciples the greatauthority He had given them: ""He who listens to you listens toMe; he who rejects you rejects Me; but he who rejects Me rejectshim who sent Me "" (verse 16). This is the fundamental basis torcalling down God's curses on anyone: his persistent rebellionagainst God's authority expressed in His Law and the ministry ofHis servants.We need to clearly and forcefully proclaim the war cries of thePrince of Peace. Only then will the Church awake from itslethargy and once again enter the battle. If we tail to pass onthe battle cry then a lack of urgency and confusion in the rankswill be inevitable.Like Psalm 1 our preaching needs to clearly show the blessings ofobedience and the curse of disobedience. The eternal truth isthat God cannot be mocked. Whatever a man sows - that shall hereap (Galatians 6:7). The curses pronounced on disobedience inDeut 28:47-53 were fulfilled in detail in Samaria (2 Kings6:2&29) and in Judea (AD 70). The wrath of God upon covenantbreakers is real.The ""I"" of the Psalms is Jesus Christ. The ""we"" of the Psalmsincludes those of us in the Lord Jesus. The enemies are not ourown, individually, but those of the Lord and of His Church. ThePsalms are ot Christ as Prophet, Priest, and King. They recordChrist's march in victory against the kingdom of darkness. AsChrist is the author of the Psalms, so, too, is He the finalfulfilment of the covenant on which they are based. God willanswer the psalmist's prayers completely in Jesus Christ on thefinal day of judgment. While on earth Jesus foretold the day whenHe will say: ""But those enemies of Mine who did not want Me to beKing over them - bring them here and kill them in front of Me""Luke 19:27.A fatal end awaits everyone who refuses to acknowledge and toobey Jesus as King and Lord. Hearing expositions of these warpsalms of the Prince of Peace will remind His people that God'skingdom is at war! The kingdom of darkness is being overcome bythe kingdom of Jesus Christ, a war in which each localcongregation of believers plays a vital part. You must rally yourbattalion to put on the whole armour of God, including ""the swordof the Spirit, which is the Word of God "" Eph 6:17. That battle-readiness also involves ""pray(ing) in the Spirit on all occasionswith all kinds of prayers and requests n Eph 6:18.Christ teaches His army to pray for the utter destruction of theenemies of God as the psalmist did: ""Pour out Your wrath on thenations that do not acknowledge You, on the kingdoms that do notcall on Your Name"" Ps 79:6.To deal with the very real hurts and injustices in this world itis necessary for us to pray for God's justice. Those who arepersecuted need the comfort of these prayers.""Let the saints rejoice in His honour and sing for joy...May thepraise of God be in their mouths and a double-edged sword intheir hands, to inflict vengeance on the nations and punishmenton the peoples, to bind their kings with fetters, their nobleswith shackles of iron, to carry out the sentences written againstthem. This is the glory of all His saints. Praise the Lord. "" Ps149:5-9Prayer is, in fact, spiritual warfare. One weapon is prayer forconversion of spiritual enemies; another is prayer for judgementon those who finally refuse to be converted. We handicap the armyof God when we refuse to use both of these great weapons that Hehas given us. It is at all times a part of the task of the peoplenf God to destroy evil.If you have been guilty of dulling your sword, by neglecting orundermining these psalms, repent of that sin, sharpen your swordanew, and go forth to do battle in the Name and for the Glory ofJesus - until ""the knowledge of the Lord will cover the earth asthe waters cover the sea"" Hab 2:14.The full book ""War Psalms of the Prince of Peace "" is available,at R25, from Frontline Fellowship, PO Box 74 Newlands, 7725 RSA.PERMISSION TO REPRODUCEThose wishing to reproduce or quote from any edition of FF Newsare encouraged to do so.

I help it better to ask questions before I spout an opinion.We've been progressing towards that goal for 30 years now.  We precedeany orbiting mission with flyby missions.  Of course, it gets harder todo as we work our way farther away from Earth.  We're just starting towork out to the outer planets: Galileo will orbit Jupiter, and Cassini around Saturn.  >How about a mission (unmanned) to Pluto to stay in orbit and record things>around and near and on Pluto.. Well first things first. We'll do a flyby mission first since it ismuch easier and faster to do.  If the Fast Pluto Flyby mission is approved thenwe'll launch a Pluto mission before the end of the decade.  A Pluto orbiterhowever requires a larger spacecraft and a longer cruise period.   Orbitinsertion requires more fuel has to be carried along and restricts thetrajectory to a slower approach velocity to Pluto.I'd imagine though that we would be doing a Neptune orbitingmission before a Pluto orbiting mission, unless the Pluto flyby turnsup something really interesting.     ___    _____     ___    /_ /|  /____/ \  /_ /|     Ron Baalke         | baalke@kelvin.jpl.nasa.gov    | | | |  __ \ /| | | |     Jet Propulsion Lab | ___| | | | |__) |/  | | |__   M/S 525-3684 Telos | The aweto from New Zealand/___| | | |  ___/    | |/__ /| Pasadena, CA 91109 | is part caterpillar and|_____|/  |_|/       |_____|/                     | part vegetable.	sci.space

Sources: NASA fact sheets, Cassini Mission Design    team, ISAS/NASDA launch schedules, press kits.    ASUKA (ASTRO-D) - ISAS (Japan) X-ray astronomy satellite, launched into    Earth orbit on 2/20/93. Equipped with large-area wide-wavelength (1-20    Angstrom) X-ray telescope, X-ray CCD cameras, and imaging gas    scintillation proportional counters.    CASSINI - Saturn orbiter and Titan atmosphere probe. Cassini is a joint    NASA/ESA project designed to accomplish an exploration of the Saturnian    system with its Cassini Saturn Orbiter and Huygens Titan Probe. Cassini    is scheduled for launch aboard a Titan IV/Centaur in October of 1997.    After gravity assists of Venus, Earth and Jupiter in a VVEJGA    trajectory, the spacecraft will arrive at Saturn in June of 2004. Upon    arrival, the Cassini spacecraft performs several maneuvers to achieve an    orbit around Saturn. Near the end of this initial orbit, the Huygens    Probe separates from the Orbiter and descends through the atmosphere of    Titan. The Orbiter relays the Probe data to Earth for about 3 hours    while the Probe enters and traverses the cloudy atmosphere to the    surface. After the completion of the Probe mission, the Orbiter    continues touring the Saturnian system for three and a half years. Titan    synchronous orbit trajectories will allow about 35 flybys of Titan and    targeted flybys of Iapetus, Dione and Enceladus. The objectives of the    mission are threefold: conduct detailed studies of Saturn's atmosphere,    rings and magnetosphere; conduct close-up studies of Saturn's    satellites, and characterize Titan's atmosphere and surface.    One of the most intriguing aspects of Titan is the possibility that its    surface may be covered in part with lakes of liquid hydrocarbons that    result from photochemical processes in its upper atmosphere. These    hydrocarbons condense to form a global smog layer and eventually rain    down onto the surface. The Cassini orbiter will use onboard radar to    peer through Titan's clouds and determine if there is liquid on the    surface. Experiments aboard both the orbiter and the entry probe will    investigate the chemical processes that produce this unique atmosphere.    The Cassini mission is named for Jean Dominique Cassini (1625-1712), the    first director of the Paris Observatory, who discovered several of    Saturn's satellites and the major division in its rings. The Titan    atmospheric entry probe is named for the Dutch physicist Christiaan    Huygens (1629-1695), who discovered Titan and first described the true    nature of Saturn's rings.

JPL has developed a backup plan using data    compression (JPEG-like for images, lossless compression for data from    the other instruments) which should allow the mission to achieve    approximately 70% of its original objectives.

Has made    multiple lunar flybys. Released Hagoromo, a smaller satellite,    into lunar orbit. This mission made Japan the third nation to    orbit a satellite around the Moon.    MAGELLAN - Venus radar mapping mission. Has mapped almost the entire    surface at high resolution. Currently (4/93) collecting a global gravity    map.    MARS OBSERVER - Mars orbiter including 1.5 m/pixel resolution camera.    Launched 9/25/92 on a Titan III/TOS booster. MO is currently (4/93) in    transit to Mars, arriving on 8/24/93. Operations will start 11/93 for    one martian year (687 days).    TOPEX/Poseidon - Joint US/French Earth observing satellite, launched    8/10/92 on an Ariane 4 booster. The primary objective of the    TOPEX/POSEIDON project is to make precise and accurate global    observations of the sea level for several years, substantially    increasing understanding of global ocean dynamics. The satellite also    will increase understanding of how heat is transported in the ocean.    ULYSSES- European Space Agency probe to study the Sun from an orbit over    its poles. Launched in late 1990, it carries particles-and-fields    experiments (such as magnetometer, ion and electron collectors for    various energy ranges, plasma wave radio receivers, etc.) but no camera.    Since no human-built rocket is hefty enough to send Ulysses far out of    the ecliptic plane, it went to Jupiter instead, and stole energy from    that planet by sliding over Jupiter's north pole in a gravity-assist    manuver in February 1992. This bent its path into a solar orbit tilted    about 85 degrees to the ecliptic. It will pass over the Sun's south pole    in the summer of 1993. Its aphelion is 5.2 AU, and, surprisingly, its    perihelion is about 1.5 AU-- that's right, a solar-studies spacecraft    that's always further from the Sun than the Earth is!    While in Jupiter's neigborhood, Ulysses studied the magnetic and    radiation environment. For a short summary of these results, see    *Science*, V. 257, p. 1487-1489 (11 September 1992). For gory technical    detail, see the many articles in the same issue.

Good buy?A local dealer is offering Mac II vi machines equipped with Kodak multi-session compatible CD-ROM drives for what seems like an attractive price:$1500. I've used many other models up to a II ci, but this would be thefirst I could have my own Mac. Is it safe to buy an about-to-be discontinuedmodel such as this. I'd like to yank the CD-ROM drive out, put it in ahousing and share it with my PC. Is this feasible? The only info I have onthe II vi is that it is relatively slow (16MHz), has an 68030 chip with amath coprocessor. I want to add a non-Apple portrait monitor and use thismachine for HyperCard stack design. Is this a good buy, or would I bewasting my money? I would appreciate some advice.

"From: jayne@mmalt.guild.org (Jayne Kulikauskas)Subject: What's in a name?: the sequelI've been thinking about the idea that was raised (by Michael Covington, I think) that words mean what we think they mean, regardless of etymology.  I've been reflecting on what certain words meant in my childhood and tracing how this shaped some of my attitudes. I grew up in a home where Christ was a bad word.  People who were very angry said it.  The word Christian meant someone who was not a Jew.  It carried connotations of otherness, of threat, of enemy.  It took some time to figure out that there was a connection between `Christ' and `Christian'.  When I accepted Jesus, I expected to be disowned.  To become a Christian meant to join the enemy.  I knew others would consider me a traitor.  At some level, I agreed, but was still prepared to pay this price.  Like Esau, I sold my birthright.  However, I made a better bargain.  He only got some stew, but I got the incomparable riches of knowing Christ.As it turned out, my parents did not disown me.  I found out later that they were hoping it was a phase that I would grow out of.  By the time they had decided it wasn't a phase, they were sort of used to it.  They didn't disown me but they didn't completely accept the situation either.  For example, they didn't come to my wedding because it was in a church.   When I visited my grandmother in the hospital a few days before her death, she said to me, ""As far as I'm concerned, you still are a Jew."" What she meant was that she loved me and forgave me.  But I am not a Jew.  I am a Christian.  (I'll concede, one that likes chicken soup with matzoh balls.:-)) I do not keep kosher.  I do not celebrate the Sabbath on Saturday.  My sons are not circumcised.  But these things are true of some people who do consider themselves Jews.  It is not these rules that make people Jews; it is the heritage from the past.  I gave up the past.This is why I find it hard to relate to Messianic Jews.  Their experience is unlike mine.  They still consider themselves Jews while following Jesus.  Some would even say that I *must* do so, too.  I am at a stage of my life now where I would like to have a heritage.  It was not something I valued very much when I gave it.  But I did have a sense that I was giving it for God.  It may have been a small sacrifice.  It may have been an unnecessary sacrifice.  But I gave it and do not want to ask for it back.And while I don't have the heritage I was born with, I do have another.  I am an outcast from the house of Israel, but I am a member of the Church.  One of the things I like about being a Catholic Christian is that it is rich in tradition.  It gives me a feeling of, once again, being rooted in the past. This is probably one of the reasons why I don't like it when people mess around with Christian traditions (for example, changing the name of Easter).  These traditions fill an important emotional need of mine.I suppose the point of all this is that people shouldn't assume that all believers of Jewish background are the same.  For some `Jewish Christian' is a good name, for others it is an oxymoron. Jayne Kulikauskas/jayen@mmalt.guild.org"	soc.religion.christian

"From: romdas@uclink.berkeley.edu (Ella I Baff)Subject: GETTING AIDS FROM ACUPUNCTURE NEEDLES   someone wrote in expressing concern about getting AIDS from acupuncture   needles.....Unless your friend is sharing fluids with their acupuncturist who               themselves has AIDS..it is unlikely (not impossible) they will get AIDS         from acupuncture needles. Generally, even if accidently inoculated, the normalimmune response should be enough to effectively handle the minimal contaminant involved with acupuncture needle insertion. Most acupuncturists use disposable needles...use once and throw away. They      do this because you are not the only one concerned about transmission of diseases via this route...so it's good business to advertise ""disposable needlesused here."" These needles tend to be of a lower quality however, being poorly manufactured and too ""sharp"" in my opinion. They tend to snag bloodvessels on insertion compared to higher quality needles.                                                                        If I choose to use acupuncture for a given complaint, that patient will get their own set of new needles which are sterilized between treatments.      The risk here for hepatitis, HIV, etc. transmission is that I could mistakenly use an infected persons needles accidently on the wrong              patient...but clear labelling and paying attention all but eliminates this risk. Better quality needles tend to ""slide"" past vessels and            nerves avoiding unpleasant painful snags..and hematomas...so I use them.                        Acupuncture needles come in many lengths and thicknesses...but they are all solid when compared to their injection-style cousins. In China, herbal solutionsand western pharmaceuticals are occasionally injected into meridian points purported to have TCM physiologic effects and so require the same hollow needles used for injecting fluid medicine. This means...thinkingtiny...that a samll amount of tissue, the diameter of the needle bore, will be injected into the body as it would  be in a typical ""shot."" when the skin is puntured. On the other hand when the solid acupuncture needle is inserted, the skin tends to ""squeeze"" the needle from the tip to the level of insertion such that any 'cooties' that haven't been schmeared away with alcohol before insertion, tend to remain on the surface of the skin minimizing invasion from the exterior. Of course in TCM...the body's exterior is protected by the Wei (Protective) Qi..so infection is unlikely....or in other words...there is a normal inflammatory and immune response that accompanies tissue damage incurred at the puncture site.While I'm fairly certain your friend will not have a transferable disease transmitted to them via acupuncture needle insertion, I would like to know for what complaint they have consulted the acupuncturist...not to know  if it would be harmful.. but to know if it would be helpful.

"From: svec5@menudo.uh.edu (T.C. Zhao)Subject: Full Color Image Editor for SGI Workstations   I am happy to announce the first public release of the bit program,   an INTERACTIVE, FULL COLOR image viewer and editor based on SGI GL.   Besides typical touchup tasks, such as crop, rotate, smooth, etc,   bit offers some unique features not available in similar programs,   such as text and vector support and the separation of text and image.   The following is the relevant sections from the man page.    -----------------------------------------------------------------Pre-Release of May, 1993                                       BIT(1L)NAME   bit - Bitmap Image Touchup for SGI WorkstationsDESCRIPTION  bit is an interactive full color image viewer and editor based on  Silicon Graphics GL. As a full color program, bit handles images of both  24bits and color index in a natural and efficient manner.  As an image viewer, bit allows list of images to be displayed in their  original type (24bits or color index) in any order and in any of the  many built-in styles of display. You can walk up and down the list using  mouse and keyboard, or you can let bit do the walk for you (The  SlideShow).  With the pan and zoom features, large images can be viewed  in full without being limited by the window or screen size.  As an image editor, bit performs a large number of image editing and  processing tasks accurately and efficiently. It keeps information loss  at any stage of the editing process at an absolute minimum by performing  subpixel sampling automatically while conserving the input image type  whenever possible to avoid unnecessary promotion and/or quantization of  input images. You can also cut a piece of an image and paste it into  another.  In addition, arbitrarily colored and sized text and simple  geometric figures can be rendered on top of an image for annotation with  the option to make them part of the bitmap or output separately to take  advantage of the higher printer resolutions (e.g. PostScript).  Bit can also be used as a graphical user interface to many existing  image processing programs by defining external bindings which in essence  turn command line oriented programs into bit subfunctions and can be  accessed by a press of a button, and best of all, the processed image  will be read back and displayed immediately. Convolution using exter-  nally defined matrices of arbitrary order can be performed dynamically  giving great flexibility in processing an image.FEATURES  Bit performs all of its image manipulations interactively with a  continuous progress report, and once the processing is complete,   the processed image will be displayed.  Current features include  o Rotates an image by an arbitrary angle with the option of anti-aliasing    and filling the ""rotated out"" region with an arbitrary color.  o Scales an image by arbitrary factors in x- and/or y-directions with    the option of subpixel sampling.  o Renders text of arbitrary color, size or orientation on top of an    image with the option of rendering directly into the raster or saving    the text and raster separately, such as into a PostScript file, to    take advantage of a higher printer resolution. Besides normal text    strings, many predefined special symbols can be input conveniently as    in TeX(1), e.g., $\alpha$\small$\beta$ produces Greek alphabet alpha    followed by a slightly smaller Greek alphabet beta.  o Presents graphically the histogram of an image.  o Performs arbitrary 1-to-1 pixel transformation.  The transformation    function can be specified interactively and can be of arbitrary    forms. Further, the transformation can be applied to RGB channels    separately or simultaneously and to the entire image or a portion of    it. Many difficult tasks, such as thresholding, can be accomplished    rather easily by 1-to-1 transformation in combination with the avai-    lability of graphical histograms of the image.  o Places simple geometric figures (SGFs), e.g., arrows, circles, trian-    gles etc., of arbitrary color, size and orientation into an image at    arbitrary locations addressed either in absolute pixels or in some    user definable coordinate system units, with the option of rendering    directly into the raster or save the sgfs and raster separately (e.g,    PostScript file).

Iguess I have some REAL ethical problems with the practices at thischurch.  I understand that Baptism is an overriding factor.  I alsounderstand that this is not an honest way to proceed.  Unfortunately,this is becoming more typical of congregations as the Second Coming isperceived to approach.There is a real element of disparation in this 'make it happen at anycost' style of theology.  I wonder where TRUST IN THE LORD fits intothis equation?Baptisms draw parents' ire -- Children at church carnival in Springstold they'd be killed by bee stings if they didn't submit to religiousrite.By Dick Foster -- Rocky Mountain News Southern BureauColorado Springs -- Outraged parents say their children were lured toa church carnival and then baptixed without their permission by aBaptist minister.Doxens of children, some as young as 8 years old and unaccompanied bytheir parents, thought they were going to a carnival at theCornerstone Baptist Church, where there would be a big water fight,free balloons, squirt guns and candy.Before that May 1 carnival was over, however, children were whiskedinto a room for religious instruction and told they should bebaptized.  In many cases they consented, although they or theirfamilies are not of the Baptist faith.The baptisms by the church have angered many parents, includingPaulette Lamontagne, a Methodist and mother of twin 8-year-old girlswho were baptized without her knowledge or consent.'My understnading was they were going to a carnival.  I feel that's afalse pretense,' said Lamontagne.  Her daughters said the ministertold them they would be killed by bee stings if they were notbaptized.Cornerstone church officials defended their actions.'We take our instructions from the word of God and God has commandedus to baptize converts.  No one can show me one passage in the Biblewhere it says that parental permission is required before a child isbaptized,' said Dan Irwin, associate pastor of the Cornerstone BaptistChurch.Church officials did not tell parents their children would be baptizedbecause 'they didn't ask,' Irwin said.Many other parents also felt they were simply sending their childrento a carnival at the invitation of their children's friends who weremembers of the Cornerstone Church.Police said chhurch officials had broken on laws in baptizing thechildren, but indicated the parents could pursue civil action.-------------------------------------------Aren't these the same behaviors we condemnin the Hari Krishnas and other cults?[I think the issues are more complex than the newspaper accountmentions.  First, I'm not entirely sure that parental consent isabsolutely required.  This would be extremely difficult, because ofthe clear commandment to obey parents.  But if an older child insistedon being baptized without their parents' consent, I might be willingto do it.  However this would be a serious step, and would warrantmuch careful discussion.  The problem I find here is not so muchparental consent as that there was nobody's consent.  Whether youbelieve in infant baptism or not, baptism is supposed to be the signof entry into a Christian community.  If there isn't a commitment from*somebody*, whether parent or child, and no intent to become part ofthe Church, the baptism appears to be a lie.  Furthermore, it islikely to raise serious practical problems.  What if the child is froma baptist tradition?  Normally when he reaches the age of decision, hewould be expected to make a decision and be baptized.  But he alreadyhas been, by a church claiming to be a Baptist church.  So does he getrebaptized?  Neither answer is really very good.  If not, he's beingrobbed of an experience that should be very significant to his faith.--clh]	soc.religion.christian

The parts aremostly independent, but you should read the first part before the rest.We don't have the time to send out missing parts by mail, so don't ask.Notes such as ``[KAH67]'' refer to the reference list in the last part.The sections of this FAQ are available via anonymous FTP to rtfm.mit.edu as /pub/usenet/news.answers/cryptography-faq/part[xx].  The Cryptography FAQ is posted to the newsgroups sci.crypt, sci.answers, and news.answersevery 21 days.Contents:* What is a one-way hash function?* What is the difference between public, private, secret, shared, etc.?* What are MD4 and MD5?* What is Snefru?* What is a one-way hash function?  A typical one-way hash function takes a variable-length message and  produces a fixed-length hash. Given the hash it is computationally  impossible to find a message with that hash; in fact one can't  determine any usable information about a message with that hash, not  even a single bit. For some one-way hash functions it's also  computationally impossible to determine two messages which produce the  same hash.  A one-way hash function can be private or public, just like an  encryption function. Here's one application of a public one-way hash  function, like MD5 or Snefru. Most public-key signature systems are  relatively slow. To sign a long message may take longer than the user  is willing to wait. Solution: Compute the one-way hash of the message,  and sign the hash, which is short. Now anyone who wants to verify the  signature can do the same thing.  Another name for one-way hash function is message digest function.* What is the difference between public, private, secret, shared, etc.?  There is a horrendous mishmash of terminology in the literature for a  very small set of concepts. When an algorithm depends on a key which  isn't published, we call it a private algorithm; otherwise we call it  a public algorithm. We have encryption functions E and decryption  functions D, so that D(E(M)) = M for any message M. We also have  hashing functions H and verification functions V, such that V(M,X) = 1  if and only if X = H(M).  A public-key cryptosystem has public encryption and private  decryption. Checksums, such as the application mentioned in the  previous question, have public hashing and public verification.  Digital signature functions have private hashing and public  verification: only one person can produce the hash for a message,  but everyone can verify that the hash is correct.  Obviously, when an algorithm depends on a private key, it's meant to  be unusable by anyone who doesn't have the key. There's no real  difference between a ``shared'' key and a private key: a shared key  isn't published, so it's private. If you encrypt data for a friend  rather than ``for your eyes only'', are you suddenly doing  ``shared-key encryption'' rather than private-key encryption? No.* What are MD4 and MD5?  MD4 and MD5 are message digest functions developed by Ron Rivest.  Definitions appear in RFC 1320 and RFC 1321 (see part 10). Code is  available from [FTPMD].  Note that a transcription error was found in the original MD5 draft  RFC. The corrected algorithm should be called MD5a, though some  people refer to it as MD5.* What is Snefru?  Snefru is a family of message digest functions developed by Ralph  Merkle. Snefru-8 is an 8-round function, the newest in the family.  Definitions appear in Merkle's paper [ME91a]. Code is available from  [FTPSF].	sci.crypt

I'dlike to expand our show automation a bit- namely add the capability touse cue tapes to bring the houselights up.  Our current automationconsoles date from the early 60's and don't provide this function.We already have the combo failsafe/contact rollers to read the cuetapes,and our dimmer system will raise the houselights when its fade-up controlcircuit (120 VAC) is momentarily closed, for at least 0.5 second.I've tried wiring the dimmer control to a 12V relay, activated when thecue tape completes the circuit.  Low tech and simple, but there's oneproblem:  In order to get the 1/2 second pulse, there needs to bea sh**load of cuetape on the film.  (35mm runs at 90 feet per minute,so to get a 1/2 second pulse, there needs to be at least 9 inches of solidcuetape!)Ideally, I would like to use a single cross-cue to accomplish this function.(A single strip of cuetape perpendicular to the length of the film)This would give a pulse of approximately 1/100 of a second.What I need is a circuit to detect the short cue and activate the relayfor around 1/2 second.  The ability to adjust how long the relayis activated would be nice.  I figure this would require an RC circuitof some sort.  I'm sure some of you already have the solution figuredout in your heads.  Any suggestions and schematics would be appreciated!Thanks,Mark Fontana--  ""Of all the arts, the cinema is  |  Mark A.

The article,in turn, cites a misleading statistic that was originallyreported in the New England Journal of Medicine.  Thearticle states, ""A study... found that a gun in the homewas 43 times more likely to be used to kill its owner,spouse, a friend, or child than to kill an intruder.""  Thisis an often-quoted statistic, and it is misleading for sev-eral reasons, outlined below:The study gives the impression that, if you own agun, the likelihood that you will successfully use it todefend yourself is less than that of the gun being turnedagainst you.  The study, however, fails to take intoaccount cases where a law-abiding citizen uses a gunto thwart a crime, without actually killing the perpe-trator.The study actually refers to 'acquaintances' ratherthan 'friend'.

Possibly an acquaintance, but hardly afriend.The NEJM study is based on the immediate dis-position of cases and fails to take into account casesoriginally filed as homicides that were later ruled to beself-defense.  Especially considering the small samplesize (396), taking these events into account has a sub-stantial effect on the 43:1 ratio quoted.Criminologist Gary Kleck gives us a slightly dif-erent statistic: a gun is 33 times more likely to beused, successfully, by a private citizen against anaggressor than it is to kill anyone at all.  Further, per-sons defending themselves from aggression by using agun fare better than those who resist vicimization bysome other means, or who offer no resistance at all.Statistics available from the FBI and other agenciesalso show that a gun is 245 times more likely to beused by a non-criminal to defend against criminal threatthan to be used to commit criminal homicide, 535 timesmore likely to be used to defend against a criminalthreat than to accidentally kill anybody, and 50 timesmore likely to defend against criminal threat than to beused to commit suicide.It is well to keep in mind that nearly anything canbe proved by uncritical quotation of statistics.

The temperature inthe room builds up and then everything inflammable in the room catchesfire at once. This may have occurred in the BD compound, I have heard reports thatthe windows were covered which would permit a fire to start unnoticedby those outside the compound.  When the fire got big enough, andbroke through the walls, it appeared to be started in two places butwas really one big fire. Because of the large quantities of tear gas inserted into the buildingit is possible that many of the women and children were in a room freeof tear gas they would try to seal the door to keep out the tear gas.When they learned that a fire had broken out it was too late for themto escape.  They were trapped by the flames in their safe room. I find it hard to believe that the FBI was not recording the finalassault.  I think that they would have wanted to have tapes to showtheir agents of the the FBI overcoming the ""forces of evil"", akathe Branch Davidians.

Scalping is illegal but nonetheless present outside the Arena.  Best strategy, given that you don't mind missing the Anthem (which is OK if B.E.Taylor decides to come back ever again :) ) is to wait until 7:40 or 7:45,when the game is rolling; the scalpers are at this point desperate to selland will reduce to near or at face value to get rid of their tickets.

Surprise, surprise!	This is true, but it's not quite the whole story.  There were 	actually some people who were more careful in their methodology	who also replicated the 'phantom leaf effect.'    One of the most influential critics of Kirlian Electrophotography    is a Theosophist (and threfore presumably willing to entertain the    hypothesis of scientific evidence for a human aura, electromagnetic    or otherwise), professor of electrical engineering at London's    City University, and a past president of the Society for Psychic Research     named A. J. Ellison.    After years of studying the method and the claims, Ellison    came to the conclusion that the photographic images are what we    calls 'Lichtenberg Figures,' an effect of intermittent ionization of    the air around the object.  It's a bit more complicated than    'not wiping off the plates,' but it comes down to the same thing    in the end, Kirlian electrophotography has much more limited    value (if any) than was previously widely thought.  Electrical and    magnetic fields generated by the body are much too small to be    of much use diagnostically without very elaborate equipment and    usually also tracer chemicals.					kind regards,					todd+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------+| Todd I.

Trionfo)Subject: Re: WFAN    I hope that this comes off as a somewhat unbiased assesmentof WFAN and WIP(I go to school in Philadelphia, and I listen toboth stations on a consistant basis.)  Now that the fan has MikeLupica on from 10 to noon, they have a person who can get the big name guests for interviews, and not just of local importanceHe did have Dave Cheketts and Fred Wilpon on his show, but he had Bob Costas and Magic Johnson on too.    Now here are my opinions of the two stations competing talent:Morning show:  In my opinion, I think Imus is much better than Bruno, Cataldi, and Morganti, even though I would feel different if Morgantihad a better crew of people to work with.  To me, WIP triesto copy Imus but make it all sports as a theme.  In terms ofsports, Imus lacks the blanketing of the airwaves, but heinterjects humor and politics into his show.10 AM to 12 Noon:  I think Chuck Cooperstein and Lupica are equal in theirabilities to host a radio show, but I think Chuck has theadvantage over Lupica in terms of dealing with the callerwho is asking about who the local team is going to draftin the sixth round.  Lupica and the other hosts on FAN getbetter interview guests, but I heard the PD of WIP say thatthey were not interested in interviews with celebrities unlessit was a major story.  I would consider this even because they are two differentstyles of host.12 Noon to 2 PM:  At this point, I would have to give a big advantage to Jody McDonald over Len Berman because Lenny has only beenon for a couple of weeks.  I just think JM has the abilityto transcend the ""homer"" mentality of the Philadelphia fanbase.  This is most evident when the IGGLES(Philadelphia spelling) play the Cowboys because JM is a huge Dallas fan.Where else can you have people call up and predict a 93-0score without the egging of the hosts(re:WIP morning 'guys')I do agree that JM was great on the FAN weekend overnightand I miss hearing him over the current crop of rotatinghosts.  I feel that JM is the best sportstalk host on either station by a good margin.  If you are in NY andyou can't get WIP, JM does fill in on the weekends sometimes.2PM to 4PM:  This is the time when JM goes up against Francesa and Russo(fatso and froot loops) and I become the most dividedin my loyalties.  Mike and the dog are very entertaining,but they often go an hour or so without calls or even 10to 20 minutes without talking about sports.  MATD doget great guests and that is the basis for their show, soit is like the 10 to 12 debate.  Another plus is theappearances by Mike and Chris on Imus in the Morning, whichare often hilarious.  4 PM to 7 PM:  MATD go up against Fredericks and Missanelli.  I likeMike Missanelli but I just can't stomach Steve Fredericks.  I know that SF came from Philly originally, but when hewas at the FAN, he was a NY homer as much as he is a Phillyhomer now.  I don't listen to WIP much after 4 PM unless thereis a game on that night, but you will see later for the reason.  That is why I give the advantage to FAN.7 PM to Midnight:  S&M are on WIP until 8 and then it is the man who makesEli that calls MATD all the time seem like a novice oncharges of racism, G Cobb.  This man is so grating on mynerves that if I listen to him for a few minutes I gonuts.(I know that is biased, but listen to his show)On FAN, there is usually a game on, Knicks, Rangers, MetsJets, or St. John's basketball.  If the game is on thewest coast, then it is usually Howie Rose.  Of courseI think dead air would be better than G Cobb on WIP, butWIP does air Sixers and Flyers games during the season.(If this is the sports station, why did they lose theIGGLES to WYSP(home of Howard Stern in Phil.))During the summer, itis all talk on WIP.Overall, I would have to give the advantage to WFAN, withthe exception of 10 to 12, and 2 to 4 where it is even, and12 to 2 where WIP has the advantage.

"From: mhsu@lonestar.utsa.edu (Melinda . Hsu   )Subject: Re: The arrogance of ChristiansI'd like to share my thoughts on this topic of ""arrogance ofChristians"" and look forward to any responses.  In myencounters with Christians, I find myself dismayed by theirbelief that their faith is total truth.  According to them,their beliefs come from the Bible and the bible is the word ofGod and God is truth - thus they know the truth.  This stancemakes it difficult to discuss other faiths with them and my ownhesitations about Christianity because they see no other way.Their way is the 'truth.'But I see their faith arising from a willful choice to believea particular way.  That choice is part faith and part reason,but it seems to me a choice.My discussions with some Christians remind me of schoolyarddiscussions when I was in grade school:A kid would say, ""All policemen are jerks!""  I'd ask, ""How doyou know?""  ""Because my daddy told me so!""  ""How do you knowyou're daddy is right?""  ""He says he's always right!""Well the argument usually stops right there.

Ican understand criticisms of Christianity that say there's not enoughevidence to believe it, or that there's just as good evidence forother religions.  I don't agree, but clearly there are plenty ofintelligent people who don't find the evidence convincing.  But thatdoesn't seem to be your point.  Rather, you seem upset that people whobelieve Christianity is true also believe that things which contradictit are false.This suggests a model of spiritual things that's rather different thanthe Christian one.  It sounds more like an existentialist view, wherepeople choose what value to follow, but there's no actual independentspiritual reality, and so no way to say that a specific choice is insome unique sense right.  This sort of model -- with modifications ofone sort or another -- may be appropriate for some religions.  ButChristianity is in its essense a ""historical"" religion.  That is, it'sbased on the concept that there are actual spiritual entities outthere, that one of them has intervened in history in specific ways,and that we see evidence of that in history.  In the ""mundane"" world,we are not free to choose how things work.  When we drop something, itfalls (aside from well-defined situations where it doesn't).  TheChristian concept is that spiritual matters, there is also an actualexternal reality.  I hope we're all honest enough not to claim that wehave perfect understanding.  But while we may not think we knoweverything, we are confident that we know some things.  And thatimplies that we think things that contradict them are false.  I don'tsee how else we could proceed.This needn't result in arrogance.  I'm certainly interested in talkingwith people of other religions.  They may have things to teach me, andeven if they don't, I respect them as fellow human beings.  But it'sgot to be possible to respect people and also think that on somematters they are wrong.

"From: king@cogsci.ucsd.edu (Jonathan King)Subject: teams as organisms; stats or ""stats"" (was Re: Jack Morris)Note:  I'm not posting this as part of an argument with Roger Meynard,but as an independent sort of thread.  I do actually quote some thingsthat Roger Meynard wrote, but it might be better to think of this as""sampling"" his post (in the hip-hop sense) because it fits in with whatI want to say.maynard@ramsey.cs.laurentian.ca (Roger Maynard) writes:>But the point is that the only decision making pro->cess  used to determine the ""best"" is the score of the game and it re->lates to the *teams*.  Not the individual players.  There is no method>inherent  in  baseball of comparing individual performances.  And that>is how it should be, because, after all, baseball is a team game.There's an interesting parallel between this way of viewing a baseballteam and some people's conception of a biological organism.  In thebiology context, we would very likely read ""fitness"" for ""the score ofthe game"" and ""organisms"" for ""teams"".  How we interpret ""players"" istrickier, but either ""organs"", or ""genes"" might seem reasonablechoices depending on what point we were trying to make.  A ""genes""interpretation actually might be really interesting in this case, but that would be a different and probably longer post.If, however, we take the ""organ"" view, then our knowledge of biologyshould make us pause before we start saying things like ""species X ismore fit than species Y because of a better organ Z"".  Given what weknow about the interdependence of organs, we would often be suspiciousof such claims.  (But note that this type of argument is quite oftenmade when you map ""species X"" onto 'humans', and ""organ Z"" onto'brain').  On the other hand, some statements of this kind do seemmore reasonable than others, as far as we can test them (e.g. 'brain'above might be more reasonable than 'pancreas' assuming no grosspathology, particularly if species Y is a primate).Even when you make such statements, you should be concerned with thefunctioning of the whole organism, and the possibility that one organmight be more crucial for one species and a second organ in another.(Not to mention the possibility that no organ is particularly crucialin some third species.)  However, if we are non-vitalists with anykind of reductionsit streak, we will want to say that an organism isnot some completely magical unanalyzable ""whole"" but an intriguingprocess made up of various subprocesses that interact in ways that arepotentially observable.  Some of these processes might be localized toparticular organs, while others may be distributed across multipleorgans.  In a way, this is just like a baseball team, except that Ithink it is pretty clear that the processes and interactions involvedin baseball are *much* simpler and less numerous than in most organisms.>To say that one player is better than another is to be able to say ab->solutely  that  player A's team would have played better with player B>in their lineup.  Sheer speculation.  Impossible to ascertain.One thing that is quite difficult about baseball is that perfectlycontrolled experiments are sometimes very tough to do.  But, ofcourse, this has never stopped researchers from doing the best theycan, and sometimes deriving very powerful conclusions even in theabsence of certainty.  Most of this goes far beyond sheer speculation,but even sheer speculation can motivate further interesting research.>If you want to select a group of statistics and claim that Clemens>has done better [than another pitcher] with those statistics as a>criteria, then fine.In this cases, we're seeing the word ""statistics"" means ""summary ofobserved events"", where the events themselves can be viewed as theoutput of some process, and possibly inputs for other processes.Thus, if we have any valid notion of how the processes are put togetherinto the functioning organism, data in the form of statistics mightgive us a basis to test particular hypotheses.>But you have to be able to prove that those statistics measure the>individual's contribution to winning the WS - because that is the only>measure of ""best"" that has any meaning in the context of baseball.This statement brings us back to the concept of fitness again.Fitness is defined in terms of both an organism and its environment;you might be fit in one situation and not another.  Moving tobaseball, it is clear that each team spends the entire season in anenvironment including all the other teams in the league.  In at leasta nominal sense, the division winners are the fittest teams in theleague, in that they (on average) had better fitness scores than anyof their competing opponennts.  But in a real sense, there is a fairlylarge random component in the performance of each team that isdifficult if not impossible to account for in terms of factorsintrinsic to (or interesting for) baseball.  The same is true inbiology.  But here is also no direct biological equivalent of theWorld Series in basebal.  In the world series, the random componentmay be greatly magnified by the small number of games that are played,and both teams suddenly experience huge changes from the environementwhere they were originally successful.  It might be fun to watch, butit's unclear what it all really means.***Now just one more un-related point:>I have yet to see that any of you can predict a>WS winner with any greater accuracy than Jeanne Dixon.On the other hand, you have seen some of us who can predict theoutcome of the divisional races better than a random assignment ofteams to finishes, and maybe some of us (e.g. me) who can do thisbetter than the other participants in this forum on a regular basis.But this is probably only due to the fact that a 162-game schedulegives you a little hope that bad hops aren't the only differencebetween the winners and the losers.Moreover, you've had the opportunity to see some analysis of the WorldSeries situation that makes the strong claim that *nobody* can predictthe WS winner with reliably greater accuracy than a coin biased onlyto reflect the well-known home vs. road effect on winning percentage.>The stats are a nice hobby and that's about it.  There is no new>knowledge being produced.  Since stats are summaries of events, it's true that if you know theevents you can derive the stats.  But if somebody is trying tounderstand the process behind the stats, then the stats produce newknowledge, and some of this might even be reliable, repeatable, anduseful.  Speaking of which, I should get back to producing knowledgein a different field.  That is, of course, if I can produce knowledgeeven though I'm relying on stats to do it.jking"	rec.sport.baseball

Anything would be>greatly appreciated.>-Shawn>breedsa@wkuvx1.bitnetAccording to MacWeek of 2-22-93:The Cyclone will come in the same metal minitower case as the Quadra800, while the Tempest will share the low-slung case of the Centris610. Apple will offer a miniature video camera that can be mountedabove the user's monitor or moved about on the end of its cable to takepictures of objects or documents. Taking advantage of the 32-bitdigital signal processor (DSP) built into the systems' logic boards,the camera will be able to put an image measuring 360 by 288 pixels,with 256 gray levels, on the screen.Users will be able to install supplementary lenses that can recorddetail as fine as the wire bonds on an integrated circuit. The camerais expected to cost between $150 and $250.The systems will ship with all the software needed to put Apple'sCasper voice-recognition technology to work; users apparently will haveto purchase an operational high-fidelity microphone.The two models will talk as well as listen. A new system facilitycalled the Speech Manager will convert text strings sent byapplications to phonemes and then pass them to a speech synthesizer.The Cyclone will include a 40MHz '040, three NuBus slots and supportfor up to 128MB of RAM. The Tempest will use a 25MHz LC040, lacking anFPU, and hold up to 68MB of RAM; it will have a single slot that willrequire a NuBus adapter and have room for only 7-inch NuBus cards.Users will be able to update the Tempest's process but not theCyclone's.For more get the 02.22.93 issue of MacWeek.	comp.sys.mac.hardware

We can pick up laptop screens without anyproblem.Most of the so-called `low radiation' monitors are also useless. The descriptionturns out to a marketing assertion rather than an engineering one.We thought there might be a market for a monitor which was not as hugelyexpensive as the military Tempest kit, but which was well enough shielded tostop eavesdropping using available receivers. We built a prototype, it works,and it's still sitting on my lab bench. Commercial interest was exactly zero.In the absence of open standards, a monitor which really is `low radiation'(and costs 500 dollars more) can't compete against a monitor which justclaims to be `low radiation' (and whose only extra cost of production is thepretty blue sticker on the box).Ross	sci.crypt

"Subject: Space FAQ 02/15 - Network ResourcesFrom: leech@cs.unc.edu (Jon Leech)Archive-name: space/netLast-modified: $Date: 93/04/01 14:39:15 $NETWORK RESOURCESOVERVIEW    You may be reading this document on any one of an amazing variety of    computers, so much of the material below may not apply to you. In    general, however, systems connected to 'the net' fall in one of three    categories: Internet, Usenet, or BITNET. Electronic mail may be sent    between these networks, and other resources available on one of these    networks are sometimes accessible from other networks by email sent to    special 'servers'.    The space and astronomy discussion groups actually are composed of    several mechanisms with (mostly) transparent connections between them.    One mechanism is the mailing list, in which mail is sent to a central    distribution point which relays it to all recipients of the list. In    addition to the general lists for space (called SPACE Digest for    Internet users, and SPACE on BITNET), there are a number of more    specialized mailing lists described below.    A second mechanism is Usenet 'netnews'. This is somewhat like a bulletin    board operating on each system which is a part of the net. Netnews    separates contributions into hundreds of different categories based on a    'group name'. The groups dealing most closely with space topics are    called 'sci.space.news', 'sci.space', 'sci.space.shuttle', 'sci.astro',    and 'talk.politics.space'. Contributors 'post' submissions (called    'articles' in netnews terminology) on their local machine, which sends    it to other nearby machines. Similarly, articles sent from nearby    machines are stored locally and may be forwarded to other systems, so    that an article is posted locally and eventually reaches all the Usenet    sites interested in receiving the news group to which the article was    posted.    Gateway machines redirect the Usenet sci.space group into Internet and    BITNET mailing lists and vice versa; the other Usenet groups are not    accessible as mailing lists. If you can receive netnews, its more    flexible interface and access to a wider range of material usually make    it the preferred option.MAILING LISTS    SPACE Digest is the main Internet list, and is now being run by the    International Space University (in only its second change of management    in over a decade). Email space-request@isu.isunet.edu (message body    should be in the format 'subscribe space John Public') to join. Note    that the moderated SPACE Magazine list is defunct at present for lack of    a moderator. Old copies of SPACE Digest since its inception in 1981 are    available by anonymous FTP. Retrieve	julius.cs.qub.ac.uk:pub/SpaceDigestArchive/README    for further details.    Elements is a moderated list for fast distribution of Space Shuttle    Keplerian Elements before and during Shuttle flights. NASA two line    elements are sent out on the list from Dr. Kelso, JSC, and other sources    as they are released. Email to elements-request@telesoft.com to join.    GPS Digest is a moderated list for discussion of the Global Positioning    System and other satellite navigation positioning systems. Email to    gps-request@esseye.si.com to join.    Space-investors is a list for information relevant to investing in    space-related companies. Email Vincent Cate (vac@cs.cmu.edu) to join.    Space-tech is a list for more technical discussion of space topics;    discussion has included esoteric propulsion technologies, asteroid    capture, starflight, orbital debris removal, etc. Email to    space-tech-request@cs.cmu.edu to join. Archives of old digests and    selected excerpts are available by anonymous FTP from    gs80.sp.cs.cmu.edu (128.2.205.90) in /usr/anon/public/space-tech,    or by email to space-tech-request if you don't have FTP access.    SEDS-L is a BITNET list for members of Students for the Exploration and    Development of Space and other interested parties. Email    LISTSERV@TAMVM1.BITNET with a message saying ""SUBSCRIBE SEDS-L your    name"". Email saying ""INDEX SEDS-L"" to list the archive contents.    SEDSNEWS is a BITNET list for news items, press releases, shuttle status    reports, and the like. This duplicates material which is also found in    Space Digest, sci.space, sci.space.shuttle, and sci.astro. Email    LISTSERV@TAMVM1.BITNET saying ""SUBSCRIBE SEDSNEWS your name"" to join.    Email saying ""INDEX SEDSNEWS"" to list the archive contents.    Ron Baalke (baalke@kelvin.jpl.nasa.gov) runs a mailing list which    carries the contents of the sci.space.news Usenet group. Email him    to join the list.    As a general note, please mail to the *request* address to get off a    mailing list. SPACE Digest, for example, relays many inappropriate    'please remove me from this list' messages which are sent to the list    address rather than the request address.PERIODICALLY UPDATED INFORMATION    In addition to this FAQ list, a broad variety of topical information is    posted to the net (unless otherwise noted, in the new group    sci.space.news created for this purpose).

The electronics and dynamics of the inkcartridge, however, limit you to generating dots at 300 per inch.On almost any paper, the ink wicks more than 1/300th inch anyway.The method of depositing and fusing toner of a laster printerresults in much less spread than ink drop technology.It doesn't take much investigation to see that the mechanical andelectronic complement of a laser printer is more complex thaninexpensive ink jet printers.  Recall also that laser printersoffer a much higher throughput:  10 ppm for a laser versus about 1ppm for an ink jet printer.Something else to think about is the cost of consumables over thelife of the printer.  A 3000 page yield toner cartridge is about$US 75-80 at discount while HP high capacity (~500-1000 page yield)cartridges are about $US 22 at discount.  It could be that over thelife cycle of the printer that consumables for laser printers areless than ink jet printers.  It is getting progressively closerbetween the two technologies.

I am also of the opinion that salvation is by faith alone, based onEphesians 2 and Romans 3:21-31.  I also conclude that James 2, when read in context, is teaching bullet (2) above. When James speaks of justification, I would claim that he is not speaking of God declaringthe believing sinner innocent in His sight (Paul's use of the word). Instead he is speaking of the sinner's profession of faith being ""justified"" or ""proven"" by the display of good works. Also according to James 2, the abscence of such works is evidence for a ""dead"" or ""useless"" faith which fails to save.James 2 is not a problem for the doctrine of salvation by faith if itis teaching (2).  Works would have their place, not as merit toward salvation, but as evidence of true faith.

You are making precisely one of the points I wanted to make.I fully agree with you that there is a big distinction between the*process* of science and the end result.  As an end result of science, one wants to get results that areobjectively verifiable.  But there is nothing objective about the*process* of science.  If good empirical research were done and showed that there is some meritto homeopathic remedies, this would certainly be valuable information.But it would still not mean that homeopathy qualifies as a science.  Thisis where you and I disagree with Turpin.  In order to have science, onemust have a theoretical structure that makes sense, not a merecollection of empirically validated random hypotheses.Experiment and empirical studies are an important part of science, butthey are merely the culmination of scientific research.  The mostimportant part of true scientific methodology is SCIENTIFIC THINKING.  Without this, one does not have any hypotheses worth testing.  (No,hypotheses do not just leap out at you after you look at enough data.Nor do they simply come to you in a flash one day while you're shaving orlooking out the window.  At least not unless you've done a lot of reallygood thinking beforehand.)  The difference between a Nobel Prize level scientist and a mediocrescientist does not lie in the quality of their empirical methodology.  It depends on the quality of their THINKING.  It really bothers me that so many graduate students seem to believe thatthey are doing science merely because they are conducting empiricalstudies.  And it bothers me even more that there are many fields, such ascertain parts of psychology, where there seems to be no thinking at all, but mere studies testing ad hoc hypotheses.  And I'm especially offended by Russell Turpin's repeated assertion thatscience amounts to nothing more than avoiding mistakes.  Simply avoidingmistakes doesn't get you anywhere.  --In the arguments between behaviorists and cognitivists, psychology seems less like a science than a collection of competing religious sects.   lady@uhunix.uhcc.hawaii.edu         lady@uhunix.bitnet"	sci.med

I asked him toshow me the section of the vehicle code that says it's illegal.  Heshowed it to me and the paraghaph said that you can't have tint, ifyou can't see the inside of the car because of the tint. When I toldhim that you can in fact see the inside very well, he shut the bookand said ""It's just illegal, and in fact we can have someone give youa ticket for it right now."" Well, won't argue with that...Since the vehicle code says it's OK as long as you can see through thetint, I'd like to keep it (I'll re-read the vehicle code in thelibrary).  I'd also like to get some sort of paper from the policethat says it's OK, so I can get the inspection, and so that I won'tget in trouble for the tint later on. I also wouldn't mind registeringa complaint against that officer - he really pissed me off.So does anyone have any experience getting that sort of a paper fromthe police, especially in Pennsylvania? Does anyone have any experienceregistering a complaint against an officer? I called the station later on today, but they basically said there is no place where Icould register a complaint against an officer... And if I do decideto keep the tint and get a ticket anyway, how much of a chance doI stand to succesfully appeal the ticket in court?Any comments about it will be welcome!Michal"	rec.autos

(Faith = Bad.  Dogma = Bad.  Religion -> (Faith ^ Dogma).>Religion -> (Bad ^ Bad).  Religion -> Bad.)  Unfortunately, you never >state why faith and dogma are dangerous.  Faith and dogma are dangerous because they cause people to act onfaith alone, which by its nature is without justification.  Thatis what I mean by the word ``faith'': belief without justification, orbelief with arbitrary justification, or with emotional (irrational)justification.For example, when someone says that God exists, that they don't knowwhy they believe God exists, they can just feel it, that's faith.Dogma is bad because it precludes positive change in belief basedon new information, or increased mental faculty.>>So Christians are totally irrational?  Irrational with respect to their>religion only?  What are you saying?  One's belief in a Christian God does>not make one totally irrational.  I think I know what you were getting at,>but I'd rather hear you expand on the subject.Faith and dogma are irrational.  The faith and dogma part of any religionare responsible for the irrationality of the individuals.  I claim thatfaith and dogma are the quintessential part of any religion.  If thatmakes (the much overused in this context) Buddism a philosophy ratherthan a religion, I can live with that.  Science is not a religion,because there is no faith nor dogma.>>>A philosopher cannot be a Christian because a philosopher can change his mind,>>whereas a Christian cannot, due to the nature of faith and dogma present>>in any religion.>>Again, this statement is too general.

Would you assert that atheists>would make poor philosophers because they are predisposed to not believe in a>God which, of course, may show unfair bias when studying, say, religion?Have you noticed that philosophers tend to be atheists?  If a philosopheris not an atheist, s/he tends to be called a theologian.A Christian tends to consider Christianity sacred.  Christianity isa special set of beliefs, sanctioned by God himself, and therefore,to conceive of changing those beliefs is to question the existenceof That Being Who Makes No Mistakes.  Faith comes into play.  Dogmacomes into play.  ``The lord works in mysterious ways'' is an exampleof faith being used to reconcile evidence that the beliefs are flawed.Sure, interpretations of what ``God said'' are changed to satisfy theneeds of society, but when God says something, that's it.  It was said,and that's that.  Since God said it, it is unflawed, even if theinterpretations are flawed.Science, (as would be practiced by atheists) in contrast, has aBUILT IN defence against faith and dogma.A scientist holds sacred the idea that beliefs should change tosuit whatever is the best information available at the time, AND,*AND*, ****AND***, a scientist understands that any current beliefsare deficient in some way.  The goal is to keep improvingthe beliefs.  The goal is to keep changing the beliefs to reflectthe best information currently available.  That's the only rationalthing to do.  That's good philosophy.Can you see the difference?  Science views beliefs as being flawed,and new information can be obtained to improve them.  (How manyscientists would claim to have complete and perfect understandingof everything?  None---it would put them out of a job!)  Religionviews its beliefs as being perfect, and the interpretations ofthose beliefs must be changed as new information is acquired whichconflicts with them.>>Please explain how ""just because"" thinking kills people.  (And please>state more in your answer than ""Waco."")It's easier for someone to kill a person when s/he doesn't requirea good rational justification of the killing.

You might also want to try changing to 24-bit addressing (yes, I know you can't access your full 64 MB of RAM - it's just an experiment) as the video hardware registers can't be accessed then.Another thing to try as a 'recovery' measure is to use something like QuickKeys to change the pixel depth of the display.

U[1],...,U[A] can not be determined except by destroying the chip.	(Unfortunately this may not be true in reality. I suppose it's	possible to determine how a chip has been programmed with a	sophisticated[sp?] x-ray machine to look for blown fuses.)	The U's are programmed independantly by the escrow agencies.Notes:	For tapping escrow agency Y is given N[0], E(K0[Y], U0[Y]), N[1],	E(K1[Y], U1[Y]) and returns K0[Y], K1[Y].	LEA's must contact all escrow agencies with the serial numbers from	both chips and the encrypted partial keys. This allows the agencies	to record that both chips were tapped.	LEA's only get the session key, not the key to all conversations	of a particular chip. This precludes real-time decrypting of a	conversation but that isn't one of the STATED requirements.Observation:	In order for any secure by ""tap-able"" communication scheme to work,	the active parts need to share a secret. And if this secret is	revealed, communications by those that know the secret can be made	""un-tap-able"". Obvious candidates are the cryptographic algorithm	and the master (family) key.

To permanently reorder (to use the old DBASE III command) the records requires sorting the records appropriately (no problem, since I almost always use them in this order)exporting the database to another database (which can still be an Approach database), and then copying the exported files back to the original filename.  This is a small weakness, considering the other items I really like about Approach.  It is also a little slower than Paradox (other than the loading, Paradox takes forever and a minute to load).

From: David.Anderman@ofa123.fidonet.orgSubject: Update - Back to the Moon bill          Introducing the Back to the Moon in Congress:                          The Next Step                                  The next key hurdle for the Lunar Resources Data Purchase Act is introduction of the Act in Congress. At this point,  manycongresspersons have been approached about the bill. However,for a successful effort to pass the bill, we need the bestpossible congressperson to introduce the bill. Due to hisposition as Chair of the House Committee on Space and Science,Congressman George Brown is the logical choice. He has a longrecord of support and interest in space development, and helpedpass the Launch Services Purchase Act and the Space SettlementsAct.                              There is a small group of activists in southern California who have assisted George Brown in his recent re-election campaigns.We are mobilizing this group to have them tell Congressman Brownabout the Back to the Moon bill. We are also asking pro-spaceconstituents to let him know that they care about gettingAmerica back to the Moon.        Finally, there is a good chance that a nationwide alert for space activists to call or write George Brown to have himintroduce the Back to the Moon bill may be staged during latespring, 1993.        All this should produce a positive reaction from Brown'soffice. As more is known, it will be passed on.        However, even if we are successful in getting him to supportthe bill,  this alone will not ensure passage of the bill. Forany bill to become law, one of three conditions must exist:either the bill must reflect widespread national support for anissue (such as extension of unemployment insurance benefits); bepropelled by high-priced lobbyists (we're out of luck there); orhave widespread support within Congress, due to small, butwidespread, constituent support. The latter is the path that we,by necessity, must choose.                            This means that the introduction of the Lunar Resources Data Purchase Act must be immediately accompanied by a large numberof congresspersons' sponsorship of the bill.  To accomplishthis, we need activists to ask their congressperson to supportthe Lunar Resources Data Purchase Act - now. To wait until thebill is introduced is simply too late - it takes time to have acongressperson's staff review a bill.        If your congressperson mentions that the bill is not yetintroduced, please elicit their opinion of the bill as currentlywritten. We appreciate all comments on the bill from activistsand politicians.        If you have yet to see the Back to the Moon bill, pleaserequest a copy by Email (please include your U.S. postal serviceaddress), or contact your local chapter of the National SpaceSociety).--- Maximus 2.01wb	sci.space
"From: JEK@cu.nih.govSubject: When are two people marriedLISTOWNER: I have sent this to Mr Anderson privately. Post it onlyif you think it of general interest.Here is a copy of something I wrote for another list. You mayfind it relevant.A listmember asks: > What makes common-law marriages wrong?A common-law marriage is not necessarily wrong in itself. There isnothing in the Bible (Old or New Testament) about getting married bya preacher, or by a priest (Jewish or Christian). And in fact Jewishpriests have never had any connection with weddings.There is a common notion that the marriage is performed by theclergyman. In fact, the traditional Christian view (at least in theWest) is that the bride and groom are the ministers of the marriage,and that the clergyman is there only as a witness.HOWEVER!The essential ingredient of a marriage is mutual commitment. Twopersons are considered to be married if and only if they have boundthemselves by mutual promises to live together as husband and wife,forsaking all others, till death do them part.      The reason why those who have reason to be concerned about whois married to whom have always insisted on some kind of publicceremony is in order that society, and the couple themselves, may beclear about whether a commitment has been made.Suppose that we do away with the public ceremony, the standard vows,etc. Instead, we have a man and a woman settling down to livetogether.      After a year or so, the man says to the woman: Hey, honey, itwas great while it lasted, but I think it's time to move on.      She says: What are you talking about?      He says: I am leaving you and looking for someone prettier andyounger.      She says: But you can't. We are married!      He says: What are you talking about? We never got married.      She says: I remember distinctly what you said to me the nightwe first made love. You said: ""My love for you is as deep as theocean, as eternal as the stars. As long as I live, I am yours,utterly and completely. When I lie on my deathbed, my last feeblebreath will utter your name. My...""      He says: Oh that! That was just rhetoric. Just poetry. When aman is in a romantic mood, he is bound to say all kinds of sillythings like that. You mustn't take them literally.And that is why you have an insistence on a formal ceremony that isa matter of public record.      The Church insists on it, because it is her duty (among otherthings) to give moral advice, and you cannot give a man moral adviceabout his relations with a woman if you have no idea who is marriedto whom, if anybody, and vice versa.      The State insists on it, since the state has a concern withproperty rights, with child care and support, and therefore needs toknow who has made what commitments to whom.      Prospective fathers-in-law insist on it, because they don'twant their daughters seduced and abandoned.      Prospective spouses insist on it, because they want to makesure they know whether what they are hearing is a real commitment,or just ""poetry.""      And persons making vows themselves insist on making themformally and publicly, in order that they may be clear in their ownminds about what it is that they are doing, and may know themselvesthat this is not just rhetoric. This is the real thing.      Hence the insistence on a formal public explicit avowal of themarriage commitment.  The Church goes further and insists that, whenChristians marry, a clergyman shall be present at the wedding andrecord the vows on behalf of the Church, not because it isimpossible to have a valid wedding without a clergyman, but in orderto make sure that the couple understand what the Christian teachingabout marriage is, and that they are in fact promising to be marriedin a Christian sense. The Church also prefers a standard marriagevow, and is wary of letting couples Write their own vows, for muchthe same reason that lawyers prefer standard terminology when theydraw up a will or a contract. Certain language has been repeatedlyused in wills, and one can be sure how the courts will interpret it.Try to say the same thing in your own words, and you may find thatthe probate judge's interpretation of them is not at all what youintended.  Similarly, the Church prefers to avoid endless debatesabout whether ""You are my main squeeze"" and ""I am here for the longhaul"" do in fact cover the same territory as ""forsaking all others""and ""till death do us part.""      This topic has come up on the list before. (Is there any topicthat hasn't?) One listmember was asking, ""If a couple love eachother and are living together, isn't that marriage in the eyes ofGod?"" Eventually someone asked, ""In that case, what is their statusif they break up? Is that the moral equivalent of getting a divorce?Are they in a relationship that God forbids either of them to walkout on? "" The original questioner said: ""Good grief, I never thoughtof that!"" In fact, there are reasonable grounds for suspecting thatsomeone who says, ""We don't need a piece of paper or a ceremony infront of a judge or a preacher in order to show that we love eachother,"" is trying to have it both ways -- to have the advantages ofmarriage plus the option of changing his mind with a minimum ofbother.At this point someone may say, ""None of this applies to me and mymate. We are quite clear on the fact that we have assumed a lifelongcommitment, 'for better or worse, forsaking all others, till deathus do part.' So in our case, no ceremony is needed.""     To this my reply would be: The reason for requiring a driver'slicense is to keep dangerous drivers off the road.  What is wrong initself is not the existence of unlicensed drivers, but the existenceof dangerous drivers. However, testing and licensing drivers is anobvious and reasonable means of pursuing the goal of reducing thenumber of dangerous drivers on the road. Therefore the State rightlymakes and enforces such laws, and you the citizen have a positivemoral obligation to refrain from driving without a license no matterhow much of a hotshot behind the wheel you think you are.Back to the original question. We have a listmember who knows acouple who have been living together for around 20 years. He asks:At what point did they stop fornicating and start being married? Ianswer: at the point, if any, where they both definitely andexplicitly accepted an obligation to be faithful to each other, forbetter or worse, as long as they both lived. If they have acceptedsuch an obligation, what are their reasons for not being willing todeclare it in front of, say, a justice of the peace? Yours, James Kiefer"	soc.religion.christian

So far an aspirin, a good talk with your wife,or a one week vacation has cured me -- no need for group therapyor strange religions!Cheers,Kent---sandvik@newton.apple.com.

I can't help but wonder what would happen if allviolence against Israelis stopped.  Hopefully, violence against Arabswould stop at the same time.  If a state of non-violence could be maintained, perhaps a state of cooperation could be achieved, i.e.,greater economic opportunities for both peoples living in the""territories"".  Of course, given the current leadership of Israel, your way may workalso - but if that leadership changes, e.g., to someone with ArielSharon's mentality, then I would predict a considerable loss of life,i.e., no winners.Secondly, regarding your comment about the U.S. troops respondingto ""stiff resistance"" - the analogy is not quite valid.  The U.S.troops could get out of the neighborhood altogether.  The Israeliscould not.Just my $.02 worth, no offense intended.Respectfully,     Ben."	talk.politics.mideast

EDT	     THE PRESIDENT:  Good afternoon.  Please be seated.  I want to say, first, how delighted I am to be here with Secretary Riley and with Senator Graham.  The three of us served as governors together during the 1980s when we worked constantly on strategies to improve our schools, when we led often difficult and long efforts to upgrade the standards in American education and to improve the quality of instruction our children were receiving.  	     	     There were no two governors whom I admired more during that period than the two who now stand on this stage with the Teacher of the Year.  And I think both of them would join me in saying that, after all the testimony has been heard and all the bills have been passed and the funds have been raised and allocated, it all comes down to what happens between the teacher and the students in the classroom.	     	     That's why today's ceremony honoring the National Teacher of the Year is so important.  Tracey Leon Bailey is one recognition all across our country for highly advanced and innovative science programs.  He's developed and introduced into Florida's classrooms cutting-edge programs in molecular biology and DNA fingerprinting -- subjects usually taught only in college and, I might add, probably only dimly understood here in the Nation's Capital.  (Laughter.)	     	     Within three years of being hired by a satellite high school, Mr. Bailey's institution had one of the strongest science programs in the entire state of Florida, and it won numerous national and international awards.  These advanced programs aren't just for a favored few.  Tracey Bailey has inspired all kinds of students, including those previously known as low-achieving or at-risk to reach for excellence and to attain it.  This is what our students need and what our country needs. 	     	     Today, we know that a good future with high wages and rich opportunities rests on the foundation of quality education for a lifetime.  The basics aren't enough anymore.  All our kids need competence in math and science and advanced problem-solving.  That's why Tracey Bailey's accomplishments are so important and why I am so pleased and proud to participate in recognizing and honoring these accomplishments. 	     	     Tracey, you represent the best in the United States.  I'm glad to recognize you today and to formally present you with this Apple Award as the Teacher of the Year for 1993.  (Applause.)  	     	     MR. BAILEY:  Thank you, Mr. President.  It is indeed a great honor and a tremendous responsibility to represent the nation's 2.5 million teachers.  And we appreciate the support that you have shown for education, and we're looking forward to working with you to help redesign and improve our nation's schools.  	     	     We know that the quality of our children's education will directly impact the future of our economic and social landscape in the years to come.  And we thank you so much for your continued support and commitment to our children's education.  Thank you again.  (Applause.)	     THE PRESIDENT:  In closing, I would like to also welcome the education leaders in Florida who are here, those representing the national education groups who have also come.  I'd like to recognize Tracey's congressman, Representative Jim Bacchus in the back, himself a great advocate of education.  And I'd like to remind all of you that the ultimate purpose of the National Teacher of the Year Award is to find a way for the rest of us to express our appreciation to people all across this country who give their lives to our children, all of the teachers of this country who get up every day and do their best to try to advance the cause of learning for all the children of America.  They are, in so many ways, our most important public servants.	     	     Thank you very much.  (Applause.)	                                      END1:29 P.M. EDT"	talk.politics.misc

In actuality it is ""chorion"", which is the last word Acts> 1:18.  Unfortunately my Greek dictionary does not discuss ""chorion"" so I> cannot report as to the nuances of the word.I abhor publishing trash (I abhor it of myself even more than I do fromothers, but since I do not present myself as an authority on the subject, I donot feel dishonest, though I do openly admit ignorance and incompetence inthis example).  Thus I felt honor bound to do a better set of researchspecifically on the word.  First it should be noted that Greek grammar is notas tough as I first assumed (it is not nontrivial by any means, and I still amnot competent with it, but it is not as opaque as I had thought).  It turnsout that while the Index for the Bauer-Arndt-Gingrich ""Greek Lexicon"" renderseach verse in order, each word within a verse is put in greek alphabeticalorder.  Thus while the the meaning of the verse is decipherable, the syntax isfar from clear.  On the other hand, a Greek-English Intralinear Bible makesthings a lot more comprehendable.  And yes, the word for field in Acts 1:18 isindeed ""chorion."" Now I've checked several Greek-English lexicons:	""Greek English Lexicon of the New Testament,"" Louw and Nida	""Robinson's Greek and English Lexicon of the New Testament""	""Greek English Lexicon of the New Testament,"" Grimm	""Word study Concordance,"" Tynsdale	""A Greek English Lexicon of the New Testament and other 	 early Christian Writings,"" Bauer-Arndt-Gingrich	""The New Analytical Greek Lexicon,"" PerschbacherIn each case the meaning of the word Chorion was given variously as:	A space, place, region, district, field, area, ""country place,"" 	land, farm, estate, ""a bit of tillage"", and similar meanings.Nowhere do any of these books mention anything about ""grave."" As some of these books go into great detail, I would be very surprised to find that these books are all inadequate and Mr Archer is the only competent scholar in Greek.  I think it more likely that Mr Archer's investigations into ""contradictions"" to be once again, as your friend said it, ""lacking in substance,"" and thus Archer is again shown worthless as an expert witness (By the way Mr DeCenso, I would have honorably presented my results on this matter, even if I had found themto support Mr Archer's contentions). By the way, among these lexicons, (eg: Robinson's) is the definition of""agros,"" the word used in Matthew 27 to describe the field bought.  The word""agros"" is defined as ""a field in the country."" Chorion is specifically notedas a synonym to agros.  This is significant, as it is evidence of how sillyBullinger's exegisis was, which stated that the word for ""field"" in Matthew(ie: agros) is different from the word for ""field"" in Acts (ie: chorion), andthus we must be talking about two different fields (Of course you alreadyadmit how stupid Bullinger's exegisis is, but this was a small serendipitywhich drives the point home). So as of now, unless Mr DeCenso show compelling reasons to believe otherwise(eg: a reputable scholar with reputable references), I consider this particular issue closed.  See Mr DeCenso, now you can go on to answerquestions about the denials of Peter, the day of the Crucifixion, Tyre, and the fact that the author of Matthew quoted from the wrong prophet indiscussing the ""Potter's Field.""

They issued a statement after a three-day Gulf Cooperation Councilsummit saying Iran had to show proof of its good neighbourly intentions by rescindingmeasures that ""rocked Gulf stability and security.""     The leaders avoided the anti-Iranian rhetoric of recent statementsby Egypt, which engineered a last minute settlement of a border row between Saudi Arabiaand Qatar that allowed all members to attend the summit.     Egypt said its fears about Iranian intentions in the region andTehran's alleged encouragement of Moslem fundamentalist unrest were largely behindPresident Hosni Mubarak's mediation.     The GCC statement stressed that developing relations between theGulf Arab states and Iran ""is linked to enhacing confidence and to measures Iran might takein line with its commitment to the principle of good neighbourliness and the respect ofthe sovreignty and territorial integrity of the region's states.""     It denounced Iran's measures on the island of Abu Musa, which itshares with the United Arab Emirates, and the continued occupation of the Greater andLesser Tumbs islands.     Iran earlier this year extended its control over Abu Musa beyond asmall garrison it established there in 1971 under an agreement with the UAE emirate of Sharjah.     It has since rescinded orders expelling foreigners who worked on theisland for the UAE government. But diplomats say it continues to exercise its authorityover the whole island, which the UAE sess as as virtual annexation.     The Tumbs were occupied by the former Shah of Iran in 1971 and theUAE has since the Abu Musa crisis erupted insisted that they have to be returned as partof a general settlement.     The GCC leaders called on the U.N. to maintain sanctions againstIraq for not fully implementing Security Council resolutions following its 1990 invasion ofKuwait.     They endorsed once again the ""Damascus Declaration,"" a pact signedwith Egypt and Syria after their troops took part in the U.S. led alliance that droveIraqi troops out of Kuwait.     But delegates said the leaders were unable to agree the details of afund they announced they would create at their last summit in Kuwait last yearwhich would have helped Egypt's and Syria's economic development programme.     They said the leaders could not agree on a breakdown ofcontributions from each state although the total amount had been scaled down to $6 billion from the$10 billion agreed last year.     The fact that the leaders of all GCC states -- Saudi Arabia,Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman and Qatar -- attended the summit was seen as a major achievement althoughtheir unity was only maintained with outside help.     Most delegations were not too worried for the moment about the slowprogress of the conservative rulers discussions on a future security structure for theregion that boasts the bulk of global oil and gas reserves.     The leaders were unable to choose between two proposals.     One put forward by a summit committee headed by Oman's Sultan Qaboosto create a 100,000-man rapid deployment force that could rush to defend any memberagainst external aggression, such as Iraq's invasion of Kuwait.     Another was a Saudi-supported plan to expand the existing 10,000-man""Peninsula Shield"" force which had so far played a largely symbolic role and iscommanded by a Saudi general.     Little headway was made on plans for a reginal common marketalthough the summit called for concrete proposals to be submitted to next year's summit dueto be held in Saudi Arabia next December.  REUTER YA DYA DJG RTw  12/23 0835  GULF LEADERS END SUMMIT     ABU DHABI, Dec 23, Reuter - Gulf Arab states ended a three-dayannual summit on Wednesday with an appeal to Iran to end its occupation of threestrategic Gulf islands as a condition for restoring friendly ties across the Gulf.     A joint statement issued after the summit, marked by relief over thesettlement of a row between two Gulf Cooperation Council members, also called forcontinued U.N. sanctions against Iraq.     It said Baghdad had failed to implement key Security Councildecisions following the expulsion of its troops from Kuwait early last year.     The summit broke no new ground on steps to achieve a Gulf commonmarket, but called on officials to present a plan for common external tarrifs for all sixmembers to the next summit which will be held in Saudi Arabia in December 1993.     The statement stressed that developing relations between the GulfArab states and Iran ""is linked to enhacing confidence and to measures Iran might take inline with its commitment to the principle of good neighbourliness and the respect ofthe sovreignty and territorial integrity of the region's states.""     It denounced Iran's measures on the island of Abu Musa, which itshares with the United Arab Emirates, and the continued occupation of the smallerislands, the Greater and Lesser Tumbs.     It expressed deep regret and extreme concern for the unjustifiedIranian measures which contradict a proclaimed wish to develop relations and called onIran to rescind those measures and end the occupation which it said was ""shaking peaceand stability in the area.""     Iran earlier this year extended its control over Abu Musa beyond asmall garrison it established there in 1971 under an agreement with the UAE emirate of Sharjah.     It has since rescinded orders expelling foreigners who worked on theisland for the UAE government but diplomats in the region say that its security forcescontinue to exercise their authority over the whole island.

REUTER YA DYA DJG RTw  12/26 1441  IRAN HINTS IT READY TO GO TO WAR OVER ISLANDS  (Eds: updates with SNSC statement)     NICOSIA, Dec 26, Reuter - Iran told its Gulf Arab neighbours onSaturday it was ready to defend militarily three disputed islands, reminding them of itseight-year war with Iraq.     ""Our eight-year defence (in the 1980-88 Iran-Iraq war) has proved tothe world that our brave nation will never hesitate to defend the sovereignty andsafeguard the territorial integrity of Iran,"" Iran's Supreme National Security Council(SNSC) said.     A meeting of the heads of the six-nation Gulf Cooperation Councilvoiced full support on Wednesday for the United Arab Emirates (UAE) in its dispute with Iranover the Gulf islands of Abu Musa, Greater Tumb and Lesser Tumb.     The move has triggered strong Iranian criticism and warnings.Besides the UAE, the GCC also groups Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar and Saudi Arabia.     Iranian President Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani, who chaired the SNSC'smeeting on Saturday, said during his Friday prayer sermon at Tehran University:""Iran is surely stronger than the likes of you. To reach these islands one has to crossa sea of blood.""     The SNSC, quoted by the official Iranian news agency IRNA receivedin Cyprus, also criticised the GCC and described its support of the UAE as ""irresponsible.""    ""No country will ever be able to covet even an inch of Iranian soil,""said the SNSC.     Earlier on Saturday, the English language Tehran Times, believed tobe close to the Foreign Ministry, said the UAE should be aware that Iran'sself-restraint had certain limits.     It dismissed a UAE claim to the islands as unfounded and said a 1971agreement to share Abu Musa with the UAE emirate of Sharjah still applied.     ""The idea of Abu Dhabi officials that Tehran would always refrainfrom responding to the blows inflicted by them was ""childish,"" Tehran Times said.     IRNA said the newspaper was commenting on the GCC statement whichurged Iran to reverse what it says is the annexation of Abu Musa island and to pullout of the two other islands.     Iran says the islands near the entrance to the Gulf havehistorically belonged to it. The dispute flared this year after Iran tightened its control over Abu Musa.  REUTER AF JCH RTw  12/28 1011  TEHRAN PAPER WANTS IRAN REVIVE CLAIM TO BAHRAIN     TEHRAN, Dec 28, Reuter - Radical Iranian newspapers, angered by GulfArab claims to three disputed islands, are hitting back with demands that Tehran reviveits claim to Bahrain and consider improving ties with Iraq.     President Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani and senior officials stronglycondemned a statement last week by leaders of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) backing theUnited Arab Emirates (UAE) in its dispute with Iran over the Gulf islands.     But the newspapers Salam and Jomhuri Eslami demanded that Tehran gofurther than restating its resolve to defend its sovereignty over the islands of AbuMusa, Greater Tumb and Lesser Tumb.     ""It is not very clear why the Sheikh of Bahrain has joined theothers,"" Jomhuri Eslami said. The GCC groups Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the UAE.     ""If historical records are to be the criterion, the sheikh ofBahrain should go about his own business and the rule of Iranian people in Bahrain, whichbelonged to Iran until 1970, should be re-established,"" the paper said.     ""It is fitting for the foreign ministry to raise the question ofIran's sovereignty over Bahrain...and start a serious and effective drive to end theseparation of Bahrain from Iran,"" it added.     The late Shah of Iran relinquished Iran's claim to Bahrain in 1970,a year before the island became an independent state.     Iranian leaders since the 1979 Islamic revolution have carefullyavoided raising the Bahrain issue although it is occasionally brought up in the press duringperiods of tension with conservative Arab states across the Gulf.     Salam newspaper said the GCC stand showed that the policy ofappeasing pro-Western Gulf Arab rulers had backfired.     ""No matter how much you smile at sheikhs on the southern coast ofthe Persian Gulf, it is the United States and the West which speak the last word,"" it said.     ""They (the sheikhs) are nobody,"" Salam said, adding that Iran shouldrevise its policy towards its neighbours, especially its former war enemy Iraq.     ""Disregarding the logical potential of expanding ties withIraq...and going along with some Saudi-backed trends among the Iraqi opposition have played a rolein the formation of the current situation,"" the paper said.     Ties between Iran and Iraq, which fought a war from 1980 to 1988,improved briefly after Iraq invaded Kuwait in 1990.     But Tehran, which denounced the invasion and remained neutral in theensuing war, again called for President Saddam Hussein's overthrow when he suppresseda Shi'ite Moslem revolt which swept southern Iraq after his 1991 defeat in Kuwait.

The shock wave from the explosions would transfermomentum to the ship.  Now, in an atmosphere I can see this.  The energy of the explosionheats the atmosphere, which expands explosively and slams a shock waveinto the pusher plate.

A statement released by the news service of Azeri President Abulfaz Elchibeysaid ""the sentence was final and was not subject to protest or appeal,"" the Russian state news agency Itar-tass reported. But the Russian Foreign Ministry issued an appeal for the men to be handedover to the authorities in Moscow for punishment. ""This would accord with modern standards of humanity towards those who havecommitted crimes,"" the statement reads. The five men, together with another soldier who received a 15-year prisonsentence, were captured in September 1992 by Azeri police in the Kelbadzhardistrict of Azerbaijan, between Nagorno-Karabakh and Armenia. The Supreme Court in Baku said the men had gone through special training in acompany of the Russian 7th army in the Armenian capital Yerevan, after whichthey were sent across the Armenian-Azeri border into Nagorno-Karabakh to carry out diversions against Azeri troops. However, the Russian Foreign Ministry statement claimed they had deserted theRussian army and were fighting as mercenaries with Armenian armed forces inthe battle zone round Karabakh. Nagorno-Karabakh is an Armenian-populated enclave within Azerbaijan which forfive years has been fighting for independence from Baku in a war that hasleft many thousands dead and uprooted hundreds of thousands from their homes. Both Yerevan and Baku have always claimed that Russian servicemen stationedin these Caucasian republics, who were left behind after the break-up of the Soviet Union, are fighting as mercenaries in the Karabakh war. The statement from Moscow said the Russian side repeatedly appealed to theAzerbaijani government to show humanity and leniency in their treatment of thesix men, and to hand them over to the Russian authorities. It said that President Boris Yeltsin himself sent a letter with this request to his Azeri counterpart Elchibey. Itar-tass said that the soldiers' defenseattorneys had lodged an appeal for clemency.   -- David Davidian dbd@urartu.sdpa.org   | ""Armenia has not learned a lesson inS.D.P.A.

Anyone out there know?Every aircraft has flight constraints for speed/AOA/power.  Whengraphed, these define the 'flight envelope' of that aircraft,presumably so named because the graphed line encloses (envelopes) thearea on the graph that represents conditions where the aircraftdoesn't fall out of the sky.  Hence, 'pushing the envelope' becomes'operating at (or beyond) the edge of the flight (or operational)envelope'. Note that the envelope isn't precisely known until someone actuallyflies the airplane in those regions -- up to that point, all there areare the theoretical predictions.  Hence, one of the things test pilotsdo for a living is 'push the envelope' to find out how close thecorrespondence between the paper airplane and the metal one is -- inessence, 'pushing back' the edges of the theoretical envelope to wherethe airplane actually starts to fail to fly.  Note, too, that this isdone is a quite calculated and careful way; flight tests are generallycarefully coreographed and just what is going to be 'pushed' and howfar is precisely planned (despite occasional deviations from plans,such as the 'early' first flight of the F-16 during its high-speedtaxi tests).I'm sure Mary can tell you everything you ever wanted to know aboutthis process (and then some).-- ""Insisting on perfect safety is for people who don't have the balls to live in the real world.""   -- Mary Shafer, NASA Ames Dryden------------------------------------------------------------------------------Fred.McCall@dseg.ti.com - I don't speak for others and they don't speak for me."	sci.space

From: operator@mast.mast.queensu.ca (Me)Subject: Vanishing font problem....   A colleague has a bizarre font problem on his new MIPS workstation.When he first logs on (via xdm), he has a single xterm window appearwith the mwm window manager running.  In this configuration, X windowsapplications (particularly xdvi) work fine.  However, if he opens up asecond xterm application, suddenly xdvi cannot start in either window,giving the error: Unable to load ISO 8859-1 font.   The only difference between the two xterm windows is that the initialone references a different name in the Xsession file, with prettiercolours and other slight changes.  Further investigation shows that onlyopening a default xterm causes this behaviour, and more significant, ALLX applications can no longer load any fonts if they are invoked from thecommand line in either window.  If I start the xterm with a differentfont (using the -fn option), no problems.  It would seem that thedefault xterm is loading a font which somehow causes the server to loseall of its fonts.  Note: xlsfonts in either window shows all of thefonts available, so there doesn't appear to be a problem in the fontdirectories/hash-tables.   Other than rewriting the XTerm app-defaults file to use a differentfont and hope for the best, does anyone have any ideas?More info:  This is the most recent MIPS workstation (R4000 I believe),       with the most current operating system and running X11R5.

Otherwise, the key management problems inherent to symetric ciphers would make the system unworkable. It probably has some sort of public key exchange that takes placeat the start of each call. Thats how they would identify the private key in their data base?This means that either the NSA has developed some non RSA public key algorythm or the feds have decided to subsidize PKP & RSADSI. The former is rather an exciting posibility since keeping the algorythm secret while makingchip implimentations widely avalibe will be exceptionally hard. If the fedsare forced to make it avalible in order to gain public acceptance than that could break RSA's stranglehold on public key crypto in the U.S.   As for my impressions of the whole scheme It seems that instead of trying toban strong crypto, they are trying to co-opt it. Their contention that they need to keep the algorythm secret to protect the security of the keyregistration suggests possible inherent weakness to the algorythm. More likelyis that they dont want anyone constructing black market devices which dont have the keys registered. Anyone else notice that in their Q&A session, theytalk about releasing the keys only to people with proper autiorization butcarefully dance around stating that the keys will simply have to be supeonaed.They seem to be trying to keep open the posibility of obtaining keys without court order even though tapping a phone line requires one.

If the ground connections on the outlets areconnected to anything, they should be connected to a wire that runs back to themain panel, where it is bonded to the neutral connector and to the house groundrod.  A connection to a local earth ground would not necessarily meet one ofthe goals of the ground wire, which is that if a short develops from hotto the ground wire, enough current would flow to trip the breaker.

It is most likely that in thefuture possession of secure encryption tools will be regarded as possessionof 'terrorist and drug dealers tools', and be some serious Fedaral Felony.Just like common tools are 'burgular tools' if the police say so, commoncomputer programs (even computers themselves) are now 'hackers tools',and will become 'terrorist tools'.

Political dissent allreadyis very dangerous in this country, all it takes is the government todecide that enough people will take one seriously, then one becomesguilty of 'plotting to overthrow the government by illegal means'.  Thephrase 'illegal means' is defined as whatever the government wants itto be defined as.Couple this with Clinton's pressing for a 'smart' National ID card (an'Internal passport'?), with the added wrinkle that anything about you andyour past can be put on it, and you can only take the government'sword as to what is really on it (since they will be the only oneswith the means to completely read and reprogram the thing).  Isn'tthat nice?While the Feds can bust into one's safe without the keys, the ownerknows his safe has been broken into.  When they break into your 'secure'phone conversations (or other stored/transmitted data in the near future)you have no way of knowing, so accountability as to the legalities hasgone out the window.

DES has 2^56 possible keys, each two of which are simplyto convert into each other, so you have to expect 2^54 trial encryptionsin the mean case, assuming known plaintext.2^54 / 2 / (24*60*60) / 1000000 is ca. 104250.So you must have managed to do 104250 encryptions per microsecond.CE Infosys builds a very fast DES chip that manages 2 (!) encryptionsper microsecond.Yes, I'm not very seriously bothered about the security of DES yet;though you might prefer to use triple DES or IDEA, both of whichuse more key bits.joerg--Joerg Czeranski                EMail czeranski@rz.tu-clausthal.deOsteroeder Strasse 55          SMTP  injc@[139.174.2.10]W-3392 Clausthal-Zellerfeld    Voice (at work)  +49-5323-72-3896Germany                        Voice (at home)  +49-5323-78858To obtain PGP public key, finger injc@sun.rz.tu-clausthal.de, or email me.	sci.crypt

The BD even released the ATF agents they captured.  Itis clear from the release of the agents and allowing the ATF medicalattention that the BD were not looking for trouble. If the BD were violent they would have held the ATF agents ashostages.  They would not have released them like they did.  If theyhad kept the agents hostage they could have used them as bargeningchips for medical attention etc. A big thing is being made of the BD collection of weapons but no onehas shown that they had any plans to use them.  It is also apparentthat the BD did not have any military training.  If they had, theycould have dug bunkers and trenches and increased theirfortifications.  They could have shot out the lights and speakers.  Itappears that the BD were not violent, they shot back at the attackingATF agents out of panic.

"From: Grant@DOCKMASTER.NCSC.MIL (Lynn R Grant)Subject: Another key registration body bites the dust (IMHO)One of the candidates that has been suggested for a key registrationbody is the ACLU.  I think this is poor choice.   The ACLU isessentially a group of auditors: they audit how people's civilliberties are administered.  Traditionally, auditors do not like to getinvolved in the design or operational aspects of things, and with goodreason.When I was a systems programmer, it always infuriated me that theauditors would come in and tell us our implementation stunk from asecurity point of view, but wouldn't tell us how to fix it.  I alwaysfigured they just liked to critcize, without doing the work to help fixthe problem.Then I took a stint as an auditor, and I found out the real reason.Auditors don't like to recommend solutions, because it puts them in abad position if they have to criticize the implementation later.  Theauditee can say, ""Well, you told us this way would be OK.""  Itcompromises the independence that is a necessary part of the auditor'sjob.Taking the case at hand, suppose ACLU becomes a key half registrar.Suppose that, perhaps through some error on ACLU's part, a key half getsaway that shouldn't, and is used to deprive someone of her civilliberties.  The ACLU gets wind of this, and wants to take it to court.But they end up being at the same time on the side of the defendantand of the plaintiff, which is not an easy position to be in.There are exceptions to the complete independence of auditors: at oneplace where I worked, when payroll checks were printed, they were signedautomatically by a signature drum on the bursting machine.  This drumwas kept by the auditors (who also kept the check stock), andwas brought down to Data Processing when it was time to do the checks.I believe the difference between this situation and the key registrationsituation is that it is fairly obvious when it is time to do the payrollchecks:  if they were done yesterday, and someone wants to do them againtoday, he better be able to produce yesterday's checks so that they canbe destroyed.  Determining which of the many requests for key halves arelegit is a trickier process, one much more prone to mistakes that couldput the ACLU in a protecting-the-client versus protecting-the-ACLUconflict of interest.As always, my opinions are my own.Lynn GrantGrant@Dockmaster.NCSC.MIL"	sci.crypt

The basic problem with your argument is your total and complete reliance onthe biblical text.  Luke's account is highly suspect (I would refer you tothe hermeneia commentary on Acts).  Moreover Luke's account is written atleast 90 years after the fact.  In the meantime everyone he mentions has diedand attempts to find actual written sources behind the text have come upwith only the we section of the later portion of acts as firmly established.Moreover, Pauls account of some of the events in Acts (as recorded in Galatians) fail to establish the acts accounts. What we need, therefore, is a reliable text, critically appreciated, whichdocuments the death of Christians for belief in the Resurrection.

I have a 286 witha GVGA-16 video board.  I've been using the standard Windows VGA driverwith other similarly configured computers.I am thinking that my problem is with the way Windows refreshes it's screen.The problem is that once Windows has been envoked, the colors startchanging themselves.  At first I thought it was hardware, but if you opena full screen DOS program from within the Windows session, you don't haveany problems until you get back to Windows - however, when you initiallyreturn to Windows, the original colors get refreshed properly.Also, it is not a uniform color change - so if you are in solitaire, thedesign on the back of the card maintains it's original color scheme, butthe white fronts of the cards will turn grey, then blue, etc.The color changes keep getting darker until finally everything is a darkpurple-ish black.  If you pop out to DOS and exit back to Windows - thescreen gets refreshed again.If I don't log into Windows and just do DOS things from the Novellnetwork, everything is fine.I originally loaded the software by bouncing it down to the net from theother machine I had just finished configuring, then from the net to thismachine.  When I ran into problems, I deleted everything on this machineand the net, and tried bouncing it again.  When that didn't work, I triedreloading Windows to no avail.Any thoughts on things to check out?

My feeling on baptism is this:  parents baptize their baby so that the	baby has the sanctifying grace of baptism (and thus removal of original	sin) on its soul in the event of an unexpected death.		That is, the parents speak on behalf of the child which is too young	to speak on its own.  This should not surprise anyone:  don't parents	*always* do what they believe is the best for their baby?  Why would	that apply to the baby's physical needs only but not his/her spiritual	needs to have God's grace?		The purpose of confirmation is for the baby (now young adult) to 	decide to re-affirm for himself/herself the promises that his/her	parents made at baptism.

Clearly, occupation is an   undeclared war; during war, attacks against military targets are fully legitimate. Ok, let me re-phrase the question. I have repeatedly asked you if the Israelis have less human rights than the palestinians, and if so, why.From your posting (where you did not directly adress my question) I inferredthat you thought so. Together with the above statement I then assumed that thereason was the actions of the state of Israel. Re: your statement of occupation: I'd like you to define the term, so I don't have to repeat this'drag the answer out of hasan' procedure more than neccesary.   Secondly, surely israeli have human rights, but they ask their goverment to   protect it by withdrawing from the occupied terretories, not by further oppressing   Palestinean human rights.I'm sorry, but the above sentence does not make sense. Please rephrase it.   |> If a state can deprive all it's citizens of human rights by its actions, then    |> tell me why _any_ human living today should have any rights at all?

Oh well, that little tidbit aside here is what I really wantedwrite about.      How can anyone believe in such a sorry document as the bible? If youwant to be religious aren't there more plausable books out there? Seriously,the bible was written by multiple authors who repeatedly contradict eachother. One minute it tells you to kill your kid if he talks back and the nextit says not to kill at all. I think that if xtians really want to follow adeity they should pick one that can be consistent, unlike the last one theyinvented.      For people who say Jesus was the son of god, didn't god say not toEVER put ANYONE else before him? Looks like you did just that. Didn't godsay not to make any symbols or idols? What are crosses then? Don't you thinkthat if you do in fact believe in the bible that you are rather far off track?Was Jesus illiterate? Why didn't he write anything? Anyone know?      I honestly hope that people who believe in the bible understand thatit is just one of the religious texts out there and that it is one of thepoorer quality ones to boot.

From: bfinnert@chaph.usc.edu (Brian Finnerty)Subject: Mary's assumptionA few points about Mary's being taken into heaven at the end of her life onearth:One piece of evidence for Mary's assumption into heaven is the factthat no Christian church ever claimed to be the sight where she wasburied. Some Christian churches claimed to be located at the finalresting places of Peter, Mark, and other saints, but no one everclaimed to possess the body of Mary, the greatest of the saints. Why?Because everyone knew that she had been taken up into heaven.Although there is no definitive scriptural proof for the assumption ofMary, some passages seem suggestive, like the passage in Revelationthat describes a woman giving birth to a Son and later being crownedin the heavens. Of course, the woman in this passage has otherinterpretations; she can also be taken a symbol for the Church.The assumption of Mary makes sense because of her relationship toChrist.  Jesus, perfect God and perfect man, fulfilled therequirements of the law perfectly.  Under the law God gave to us, weare to honor our mother and father, and Christ's act of taking hismother into heaven is part of his fulfillment of that law. Also, hetook his flesh from her, so it seems appropriate that he decide not toallow her flesh to rot in the grave.One last point: an ex-Catholic attempted to explain Catholic doctrineon the assumption by asserting it is connected to a belief that Marydid not die. This is not a correct summary of what Catholics believe.The dogma of the assumption was carefully phrased to avoid sayingwhether Mary did or did not die. In fact, the consensus among Catholictheologians seems to be that Mary in fact did die. This would makesense: Christ died, and his Mother, who waited at the foot of thecross, would want to share in his death.Brian Finnerty	soc.religion.christian

Most generic unix software  works ok.- It must produce postscript files that I can include into LaTeX documents  with dvips.

Features I would like in the programs are.- ability to draw circles, arcs, straight lines, boxes and arrows.- support for both dashed and solid line styles for all of these objects.- support for texts in any size.- ability to move/copy/resize/rotate any part of the drawing.- ability to turn any part of the drawing into a library component  (e.g. a transistor symbol composed of three lines, an arrow and a circle)- any aid (numeric coordinates, screen grid) to align parts of the drawing.- less essential, but in fact very handy: preservation of connection.  If I move one part of the drawing, the lines that connect that part to the  rest of the drawing, stay connected.Ideally I want the tool so general and flexible that it is comfortable todraw electronic schematics, flow charts, logic diagrams, data flow diagramsand block diagrams with it. I just want to know which of the programs offer which of the features on mywhishlist and are there any other programs? How demanding are the programswith respect to disk space, memory and CPU usage?

The Book of Esther (which I read the other day forother reasons) describes the origin of Pur'im, a Jewish celbration of joyand peace.  The long and short of the story is that 75,000 people werekilled when people were tripping over all of the peacefull solutions lying about (you couldn't swing a sacred cow without slammin into a nice,peaceful solution.)  'Course Joshua and the jawbone of an ass spring tomind...I agree with Bobby this far: religion as it is used to kill large numbersof people is usually not used in the form or manner that it was originallyintended for.That doesn't reduce the number of deaths directly caused by religion, it isjust a minor observation of the fact that there is almost nothing pure inthe Universe.  The very act of honestly attempting to find true meaning inreligious teaching has many times inspired hatred and led to war.  Manypeople have been led by religious leaders more involved in their ownstomache-contentsthan in any absolute truth, and have therefore been driven tokill by their leaders.The point is that there are many things involved in religion that oftenlead to war.  Whether these things are a part of religion, an unpleasantside effect or (as Bobby would have it) the result of people switchingbetween Religion and Atheism spontaneously, the results are the same.  @Religious groups have long been involved in the majority of the bloodiestparts of Man's history.@Atheists, on the other hand (preen,preen) are typically not an ideologicalsocial caste, nor are they driven to organize and spread their beliefs.The overuse of Nazism and Stalinism just show how true this is:  Two groupswith very clear and specific ideologies using religious persecution tofurther their means.  Anyone who cannot see the obvious - namely that thesewere groups founded for reasons *entirely* their own, who used religiouspersecution not because of any belief system but because it made them morepowerfull - is trying too hard.  Basically, Bobby uses these examplesbecause there are so few wars that were *not* *specifically* fought overreligion that he does not have many choices.Well, I'm off to Key West where the only flames are heating the bottom oflittle silver butter-dishes.-ciao-chris blask	alt.atheism

While I canmanually change the V-Size on the back, this is a pain in the ass, and it justshouldn't happen anyway.  I've called Gateway numerous times and they haven't been able to help me at all.  Two different times they sent me a new card, andboth times the new card didn't work at all in my computer.  They even triedto bill me for the first card because they didn't get it back in a couple ofdays, when they TOLD me over the phone that they would wait more than 2 weeksbefore billing my card.

"From: dwatson@cser.encore.com (Drew Watson)Subject: Ethics vs. FreedomBeing a parent in need of some help, I ask that you bear with me while Idescribe the situation which plagues me...I am a divorced father. Chance would have it that ""my weekend"" with my daughter has fallen upon Easter Weekend this year.Although I am Presbyterian, I had married a Catholic woman. We decidedthat the Catholic moray of indoctrination of the spouse into the faithwas too confining (and restrictive due to time as we had already set adate), and we were married in a Christian Church which was non-denominational.During the years of our marriage, we did not often attend church. When our daughter was born, some years later, my wife insisted that she be baptised as Catholic. This wasn't a problem with me.During a separation of five years, my ex-wife was taken ill with a diseasethat affected her mental capacities. She was confined to a mental ward fortwo months before it was diagnosed. It has since been treated ""effectively"".In other words, professionals have deemed her a functioning member of society.During the recuperation, my ex-wife has embraced Buddism. Her influence overmy daughter has been substantial, and has primarily allowed me only Saturdayvisitation for a number of years. During this period I have read Bible studybooks to my daughter, and tried to keep her aware of her Christian heritage.Last fall, our divorce was finalized after a year of viscious divorce hearings.At that time I was awarded visitation rights every other weekend. At that time,I started taking my daughter to church quite often, although not every weekend.I did this to attempt to strengthen the Christian ethic and expose her to areligious community.Today, Easter Sunday, I took my daughter to church. When it came time for Communion, my daughter took the bread (The body of Christ) but left the wine(The blood of Christ) professing that she was too young for wine. She thenballed the bread up in her hand and tried to descretely throw it under thepew in front of us.I feel this was a slap in the face to me, my religion, and an afront to herreligious heritage. It can be construed as breaking several of the commandmentsif you try. I really felt dishonored by the action.My daughter is only nine years old, but I think she should have been old andmature enough to realize her actions. I have difficulty blaming her directlyfor religious teachings her mother swears to, but when I discussed this withmy daughter she made it clear she believed in Buddhism and not Christianity.My initial response of anger (moderated) was to suggest if there is no faithin Christ then why does she celebrate Easter, or Christmas? I suggested Iwould never force her to practice my religious beliefs by celebrating holidayswith her again.I do not want to ""drive her from the fold"", and would be willing to allow herto continue practicing Buddhism (as though I had a choice seeing her onlyfor two days out of fourteen) but I want her to want to embrace Christianity.Any suggestions?If you have a response, please e-mail me a copy. (I'm not a regular readerof this newsgroup.)

He also comes to first reveal the root cause oforiginal sin (fallen nature) and then provide a means to cut theconnection to that original sin.  He also wants to create world peacebased on Godism.  The messiah's teachings will build on the foundationof the Bible but provide profound new insights into the nature of God,the fall of man, the purpose of creation, and God's providence ofrestoration.  It will also provide a foundation for the unity of allthe World's religions.Many Christians expect Jesus to come on literal clouds, so they maymiss him when he returns. Just as the Jewish people missed Jesus 2000years ago.  They are still waiting for his first coming.  The Jewishpeople of that age expected Elijah to come first.  Jesus said thatJohn the Baptist was Elijah. But John the Baptist denied that he wasElijah.  (How did this reflect on Jesus?)

What sets a Messiah apart isthat he is born without original sin.  He is not born perfect butachieves perfection after a period of growth.  Adam and Eve were bornsinless but they fell, and this tragedy meant that it would take Godthousands of years to create the kingdom of heaven on the earth as Godoriginally intended.  God's restoration providence is still notcomplete.  The messiah is the true Son of God, one with God, God'srepresentative on the earth, but not God himself.

They sent me a award certificate three months ago and asked me to buy their promotion package in order to receive the majoraward. They mislabled my address and I did not receive my packageuntil one month ago. I was mad and angry about how it took themso long to get my package. So I wrote them a letter and requestedfor a refund. They never return my letter. I was lucky enough tofind out their telephone number through operator and received thepackage. I immediately returned the package and wrote them anotherletter to ask for refund. The package was returned because theyaddress they put on the package was incorrect. I attempted to call them and learnd that they have changed their telephone number.It took me at least 10 phone calls to find out their new number,but they refused to take any responsibility. I spoke to theirmanager and she said she would call me back, but she has not callyet. But I was able to get their address from their front desk.Should I just go ahead and send the package?

I suppose they never  think about the cosmic scale, or are atleast able to put it out of their minds.To me, it is comforting to know that reality is an illusion.  That thetrue reality underneath the the physical is spirit.  That this world isa school of sorts, where we learn and grow, and our souls mature.  Thatgives a purpose to my little purposes, and takes some of the pressureoff.  It's not so necessary to make this life a success in human termsif you're really just here to learn.  It's more important to progress,grow, persist, to learn to love yourself and others and to express yourlove, especially when it's dificult to do so.

From: C445585@mizzou1.missouri.edu (John Kelsey)Subject: How to make the Clipper chip and wiretapping less bad   I've got an idea that would remove most of the political complaintsI have about the Clipper chip.  Pass a law stating that if, within ayear of performaing a wiretap on someone, a police agency hasn'tmanaged to convict the suspect of the crime the warrant/wiretap was for,then that agency owes the suspect $1 million to repay him/her forlost privacy.   Of course, there are *still* problems with the technical aspects ofClipper, and with the one-size-fits-all mentality that would be behindan attempt to enforce it as a standard.  But this would be a way forthose in favor of allowing continued wiretaps to assure us that it willonly be used in cases where the crime is important and the police areall but certain that there really will be a conviction....    --John KJ            elsey	sci.crypt

I playedElvira I & II, and think that Horrorsoft has finally madea very playable game with Waxworks.  The look and feel isroughly the same as in the Elvira games, though the real timefighting is a little easier to survive.  The first two games,especially Elvira II: Jaws of Cerberus made it very tough tostay alive and hit-point restoring was very difficult.  This is not to say that Waxworks is a walk in the park, but it isquite fair, in that there is always some weapon to be foundthat is quite effective, or hint given as to the proper fightingstrategy.  In one of the four wax works to be explored, there is no fighting at all (well almost none), though all four containmoderately challanging puzzles.The really interesting thing about this game is that it is really broken up into four seperate RPGs, one for each of the four exhibitsyou must enter.  In starting each one, your character is transportedwith no objects to use, and experience level 1.  One exhibits trapsyou inside a multi-level ancient Egyptian pyramid which you must escape by fighting, mapping and puzzle solving.  Another exhibittraps you in a mine that has been taken over by creeping plant vinesand pods, while the local humans have been transformed into plantzombies.  This is a single level maze that requires you to rescuesome humans, kill the head plant alien, and figuere out how to killthe very tuff plant zombies that are always showing up.  This isperhaps the most horrifying exhibit.  Another exhibit puts you intoJack The Ripper England where you appear by the corpse of a fresh Rippervictim, and of course the police think you are responsible.  You mustavoid police and angry mobs to unravel the mystery of The Ripper and meet him face to face - but first get a disquise.  The last exhibitpus you in a graveyard where most of the challenge is in learning to stop the almost indestructible zombies.  Over all the VGA graphics and music are very effective in setting a creepy tone for the game, as was the case for the Elvira games, thoughgameplay is much improved and makes for a much more enjoyable game.I heartily recommend it for RPG and Horror fans.   *********************************************************- All prices include shipping.- All games are in excellent condition unless otherwise stated.- US buyers only please.- All games will be shipped inside a box with packing, insured,  priority USPS.- All games include all original materials including box, manual,  disks, and registration unless otherwise noted.The first responder offering asking price is guarenteed toget the game.

"From: hammerl@acsu.buffalo.edu (Valerie S. Hammerl)Subject: Sabres/Bruins notes It was unlikely, improbable.  For the Bruins, it was the stuff ofnightmares; for the Sabres, it was a taste of heaven.     For the first time since 1983, the Sabres have won the first threegames of a series.  Last time was a three games to none victory in abest of five against the Canadiens.  It takes a little more work thistime.  The Sabres seem ready to put in the extra work.   On the heels of a shutout, one that took away Boston's home iceadvantage, the Sabres came back with a four to three overtime win.  Itwasn't easy.  It wasn't always pretty.  It still worked.   John Blue got the nod for Boston, supplanting Andy Moog as startinggoaltender.  Moog was pulled midway through game 2 on Tuesday.Buffalo started with a goal by Mogilny, his fourth of the playoffs, onthe powerplay, with Boston's Don Sweeney and Gord Roberts in the box.LaFontaine and Hawerchuk had the assists.  Goal number two wasKhmylev's first of the playoffs, a pretty goal scored when the Sabresstole the puck and passed to an open and waiting Khmylev.  Smehlik andHannan assisted.  Determined not to be shut out, Boston tallied on ashot by Ray Bourque on the powerplay, with Colin Patterson and BobSweeney both in the box.  Period two was scoreless, a split ofpenalties between the two clubs.  The third saw Boston's Smolinski gethis first, courtesy of Oates.  Buffalo resecured the lead two minuteslater, from former Bruin Bob Sweeney (Khmylev and Carney).  Neely tiedthe game 3/4 of the way through the third, sending it into overtime.Last year overtime meant a Bruin win.  Last night, it spelled sweetrevenge, as Buffalo scored with Ray Bourque in the penalty box, on atip in by Khmylev (Hawerchuk and LaFontaine) a minute into overtime.Both teams finished with 34 shots.          Power-play conversions--Boston 5-1. Buffalo 7-2.        Referee--Rob Shick.Comments:  Shick pocketed the whistle in the third, allowing a lot ofclutching and grabbing.  Buffalo's penalty killing unit was fantasticagain.  Mogilny was checking.  Granted he missed once and insteadflung his body into the boards, but checking like this is a novel ideato Mogilny.  The crowd was unbelievable.  I don't think I've everheard a crowd that loud in the Aud for a Sabres game (remember, I wasonly five when they played for the cup.  I don't remember it and noone took me to the games).  Doug Bodger, in a postgame interview,noted that he tried to say something to Hawerchuk, but the crowd wastoo loud, even though he was shouting.  It didn't seem to matter, asmost of the Sabres and even Muckler said it was great.  Yuri Khmylevdidn't seem to realize that he was the game's third star and didn'tskate out when his name was called.  Sweeney (2) and Fuhr (1) eachwere out before Yuri made his appearance, sans jersey.  When asked inan interview later whether he knew how big a goal that was, heresponed yes (ok, it was through an interpreter and he said more thanthat, even more than the interpreter said, but I digress).  Theinterviewer seemed to think just because he doesn't speak English, hemust not understand playoffs.

The first period started with a give away from a Canadian defenseman and Rundqvist came in alone on Ranford but couldn't put the puck over a sliding Ranford. Later on, Kevin Dineen had a great opportunity but Soderstrom  played very well too. Stefan Nilsson had a couple of great dekes and set up Jan Larsson but again Ranford came up big. Period ended scoreless but the edge to Sweden in creating more opportunities. Second period action saw Tommy Soderstrom making a GREAT save. Mark Recchi made a backhanded cross ice pass to Lindros, Eric one timed the puck but Soderstrom was there to make a glove hand save. At the 7-minute mark, Canada started applying pressure on the Swedes. Sanderson-Dineen-Brind'Amour worked hard and kept the puck in the Swedes' zone. Dineen gave the puck to Sanderson who skated around a screened Swedish defenseman, came in on Soderstrom and made a wrist shot that went it by Soderstrom's far post, 1-0 Canada. The Swedes picked up their game after that, and Peter Forsberg had a shot that hit Ranford's post (the inside), went parallel to the goal line and out. Then Gartner got a penalty and the Swedes a power play. Jan Larsson took a shot from the slot, Ranford gave a rebound to Larsson who saw Juhlin by the far post, passed the puck and Ranford was beat, 1-1. Third period started as the other periods, Swedes having most of the pressure but the Canadians always dangerous once they were close to the Swede goal. At 5:54, Canada created some great chances and Arto Blomsten was forced to cover the puck in the Swede goal crease since Soderstrom lost sight of it. That resulted in a penalty shot, since a defenseman can't cover the puck in  the goal crease. Geoff Sanderson took the penalty shot (his first ever, he explained afterwards), and he put it low on Soderstrom's stick side, close to the post. Excellent penalty shot to give Canada a go ahead goal. Canada increased the lead on a very suspect offside, Gartner volleyed a bouncing puck past Soderstrom to make it 3-1. The Swedes ran out of gas then and couldn't produce as good scoring chances as they had for 2,5 periods. The 4-1 goal came with only 1 second left, Rod Brind'Amour scoring on a rebound from Soderstrom, where the Swedish defense already had their minds in the dressing room. A very good game (the best in the WC so far?), with both goalies playing great. Soderstrom best player in Sweden, but Ranford even played better than Soderstrom, that tells you something about Ranford. Probably the best goalie in the world, were some comments after the game. Canada played a very disciplined defense, Ranford pointed out that it is easy to play well with a good defense. Lindros played A LOT and played well, Sanderson naturally game hero with two goals. The Forsberg-Naslund-Bergqvist line Sweden's best along with Larsson-Juhlin- Nilsson. Swedish defense played well, 197 cm 104 kg Peter Popovic had the task of neutralizing 192 cm 107 kg Eric Lindros, and managed this very well. Ranger defenseman Peter Andersson finally got to go to the WC, and considering that he landed in Germany just a few hours before the game, he played very well. Swedish coach Curt Lundmark was irritated after the game, partly because of the Swedes inability to score, and partly because of the linesman's mistake on the 1-3 goal.

Only in extreme cases, like dust in the pitcher'sor hitter's eyes, should an umpire call time.The batter has 20 seconds to get situated in the box and receivea pitch. I'm against putting a giant clock (or any size clockfor that matter) up to count down 20 seconds between pitches andthe minute for warm-ups. But I think umpires should tell hittersto go to hell if they step out to get the sign or whatever, andinstruct the pitcher to pitch. The same goes for pitchers.

Is pantheism ""perverted""> and ""dangerous"", or just not one's cup of tea?  None of this is clear.I can't speak for Mr. Cavano, but I understood his comment to refer to the idea that unrecognized pantheism is dangerous to Christians.  If we unthinkingly adopt pantheistic ideas that are opposed to Christianity, we can pervert our faith.  When we clearly recognize pantheism when we encounter it we have the opportunity to embrace what is consistent with Christianity and reject what isn't.    We need to be alert, always thinking and questioning.  We must examine the underlying assumptions of every book we read, tv program we watch and socio-political movement we participate in.  Ideas are important.  Philosophies and doctrines are what give form to the events of our lives.  They are the basis from which we live our lives of love and service.  The command to love God with all one's mind means no fuzzy-headed drifting from idea to idea. > and that consumerism and our rapacious style of living> are so rarely called by their appropriate name: Greed.One Christian who acknowledges this is the Pope.

I agree there may be other villages where the civilianpopulation has deserted because it is too close to Israeli lines andthus gets bombed more often.  In such villages often the only remaining inhabitants are guerillas and some elderly who have nowhere else to go.But for the most part the typical South Lebanon village is more likemine.  One where civilians and guerillas live together.  They areoften inhabiting the same house.  Many families are large, somehave members of the families involved in Hizollah, most othersare not.  That is what is so hard of South Lebanon, Israel isnot fighting an army with well drawn battle lines, but a guerillatyoe resistance which by definition and necessity blends withthe local populace.  Not because they are evil cowards thatuse women and children as shields, but because that is the onlyway one can fight a more powerful better equipped occupying army.|> Some of the villages, and yours might well be among them, are as you|> describe.

Sometimes Israel choosesits targets carefully.

On several occasions Israel retalliated against civilian refugee camps, even in North Lebanon, just to showthat it will not sit idly after its soldiers have been attacked.Most of the time it directs the SLA to do the dirty work andindiscriminately shell some Lebanese villages on the other side.I have experienced this shelling myself on several occasions,this is why the SLA militia is sometimes even more despised than Israeli troops.||> Well, here we disagree.

I have been told thatthe built-in video should support at least 16bit and maybe 24bit color ona Macintosh Color Display.  However, the Monitors control panel stilllists 8bit (256 colors) as the highest possible.Does it make any difference which slots you put the SIMMs in?Do you have to do something to activate them?Do you have to do something to the Monitors control panel?BTW, I am running System 7.1 with 8 Megs of RAM.---Charles P.

Somebody please post it....he deserves the credit for savingus all $$$$$) it is easily fixed, if it is the same problem......Best I can figure it is due to time, heat and repeated warmup/cool downs inthe power supply....i.e., bad solder joints in the power supply circuitcard.  Go get a desolder tool from radio shack, a low wattage iron and somegood nonacid solder and resolder the lower left quadrant of the circuitcard with the AC plugs facing away from you..........or get someone to doit for you.

DOS  reacts with an error (Drive D: cannot be accessed or  something the like). Unfortunately, I cannot just reproduce  the error. Sometimes it occurs more often, sometimes  less.

I'm gearing up to   do another one.  I'd some info from you. If you were to move   onto a space colony to live permanently, how big would the colony have   to be for you to view a permanent move as desirable?  Specifically,   How many people do you want to share the colony with?    What physical dimensions does the living are need to have?     Assume 1g living (the colony will rotate).  Assume that you can leave   from time to time for vacations and business trips.  If you're young   enough, assume that you'll raise your children there.I didn't get a lot of responses, and they were all over the block.Thanx muchly to all those who responded, it is good food for thought.Here's the (edited) responses I got:   How many people do you want to share the colony with? 100   What physical dimensions does the living are need to have?

Hm.  I am not all that great at figuring it out.  But I would maximize thepercentage of colony-space that is accessible to humans.  Esecially if therewere to be children, since they will figure out how to go everywhere anyways.And everyone, especially me, likes to ""go exploring""...I would want to be ableto go for a walk and see something different each time...=============================================================================For population, I think I would want a substantial town -- big enoughto have strangers in it.  This helps get away from the small-town""everybody knows everything"" syndrome, which some people like butI don't.  Call it several thousand people.For physical dimensions, a somewhat similar criterion:  big enoughto contain surprises, at least until you spent considerable timegetting to know it.  As a more specific rule of thumb, big enoughfor there to be places at least an hour away on foot.  Call that5km, which means a 10km circumference if we're talking a sphere.

Anatomists have found no such structures.(Always beware the words ""channel"" and ""energy"" in any spiel put outby an alternative practitioner.)The answer to question 2 is rather simpler.

It was a 2-door sports car, looked to be from the late 60s/early 70s. It was called a Bricklin. The doors were really small. In addition,the front bumper was separate from the rest of the body.
